### Mini Description

Methods that provide statistical guarantees about system properties through sampling-based approaches and probabilistic analysis techniques.

### Description

Probabilistic Certification focuses on developing statistical methods to verify properties of AI systems when deterministic guarantees are computationally infeasible. These approaches leverage sampling, statistical inference, and probability theory to provide quantifiable confidence levels about system behavior, safety constraints, and performance characteristics. The field draws from both classical statistical methods and modern machine learning techniques to create efficient certification procedures.

Current research emphasizes the development of sampling strategies that can efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces while providing meaningful probabilistic bounds. This includes importance sampling techniques to focus on critical regions, sequential probability ratio tests for early stopping, and concentration inequalities to establish tight confidence intervals. Researchers are particularly interested in methods that can handle the complexity of deep neural networks while maintaining theoretical rigor in their probabilistic guarantees.

A key challenge is balancing the trade-off between sample efficiency and the strength of probabilistic guarantees. This has led to research in adaptive sampling schemes, hybrid approaches that combine formal methods with statistical techniques, and methods for quantifying uncertainty in the certification process itself. The field also explores techniques for certifying properties under distribution shift and for handling rare but critical failure modes that may be difficult to sample.
