### Mini Description

Techniques for breaking down large AI systems into verifiable components, including modular verification approaches and compositional reasoning frameworks.

### Description

Decomposition Methods in scalable AI verification focus on breaking down complex AI systems into smaller, more manageable components that can be verified independently. This approach leverages the principle that if individual components can be verified and their interactions properly characterized, properties of the overall system can be established without having to verify the entire system at once. The key challenge lies in developing decomposition strategies that preserve important properties while enabling meaningful verification of the components.

Current research explores various approaches to decomposition, from structural methods that exploit the natural modularity of neural networks to functional decomposition based on behavioral properties. Researchers are developing frameworks for proving that local properties of components combine to guarantee global system properties, including techniques from abstract interpretation, contract-based design, and assume-guarantee reasoning. A particular focus is on handling the complex interdependencies between components that can make decomposition challenging.

Emerging work investigates automated methods for identifying optimal decomposition boundaries, balancing the trade-off between component complexity and interface complexity. This includes research on learning decomposition strategies from successful verifications, developing metrics for decomposition quality, and creating tools that can suggest effective decomposition strategies for novel architectures. The field is particularly interested in decomposition approaches that can scale to handle increasingly complex AI systems while maintaining strong verification guarantees.
