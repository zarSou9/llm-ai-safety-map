    "title": "Compositional Planning for Logically Constrained Multi-Agent Markov Decision Processes",
    "published_date": "2024-10-05",
    "abstract": "Designing control policies for large, distributed systems is challenging, especially in the context of critical, temporal logic based specifications (e.g., safety) that must be met with high probability. Compositional methods for such problems are needed for scalability, yet relying on worst-case assumptions for decomposition tends to be overly conservative. In this work, we use the framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) to provide an assume-guarantee based decomposition for synthesizing decentralized control policies, subject to logical constraints in a multi-agent setting. The returned policies are guaranteed to satisfy the constraints with high probability and provide a lower bound on the achieved objective reward. We empirically find the returned policies to achieve near-optimal rewards while enjoying an order of magnitude reduction in problem size and execution time."

    "title": "A Compositional Framework for First-Order Optimization",
    "published_date": "2024-03-08",
    "abstract": "Optimization decomposition methods are a fundamental tool to develop distributed solution algorithms for large scale optimization problems arising in fields such as machine learning and optimal control. In this paper, we present an algebraic framework for hierarchically composing optimization problems defined on hypergraphs and automatically generating distributed solution algorithms that respect the given hierarchical structure. The central abstractions of our framework are operads, operad algebras, and algebra morphisms, which formalize notions of syntax, semantics, and structure preserving semantic transformations respectively. These abstractions allow us to formally relate composite optimization problems to the distributed algorithms that solve them. Specifically, we show that certain classes of optimization problems form operad algebras, and a collection of first-order solution methods, namely gradient descent, Uzawa's algorithm (also called gradient ascent-descent), and their subgradient variants, yield algebra morphisms from these problem algebras to algebras of dynamical systems. Primal and dual decomposition methods are then recovered by applying these morphisms to certain classes of composite problems. Using this framework, we also derive a novel sufficient condition for when a problem defined by compositional data is solvable by a decomposition method. We show that the minimum cost network flow problem satisfies this condition, thereby allowing us to automatically derive a hierarchical dual decomposition algorithm for finding minimum cost flows on composite flow networks. We implement our operads, algebras, and algebra morphisms in a Julia package called AlgebraicOptimization.jl and use our implementation to empirically demonstrate that hierarchical dual decomposition outperforms standard dual decomposition on classes of flow networks with hierarchical structure.",

    "title": "Compositional Models for Estimating Causal Effects",
    "published_date": "2024-06-25",
    "abstract": "Many real-world systems can be represented as sets of interacting components. Examples of such systems include computational systems such as query processors, natural systems such as cells, and social systems such as families. Many approaches have been proposed in traditional (associational) machine learning to model such structured systems, including statistical relational models and graph neural networks. Despite this prior work, existing approaches to estimating causal effects typically treat such systems as single units, represent them with a fixed set of variables and assume a homogeneous data-generating process. We study a compositional approach for estimating individual treatment effects (ITE) in structured systems, where each unit is represented by the composition of multiple heterogeneous components. This approach uses a modular architecture to model potential outcomes at each component and aggregates component-level potential outcomes to obtain the unit-level potential outcomes. We discover novel benefits of the compositional approach in causal inference - systematic generalization to estimate counterfactual outcomes of unseen combinations of components and improved overlap guarantees between treatment and control groups compared to the classical methods for causal effect estimation. We also introduce a set of novel environments for empirically evaluating the compositional approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and real-world data."

    "title": "Verifiable Reinforcement Learning Systems via Compositionality",
    "published_date": "2023-09-09",
    "abstract": "We propose a framework for verifiable and compositional reinforcement learning (RL) in which a collection of RL subsystems, each of which learns to accomplish a separate subtask, are composed to achieve an overall task. The framework consists of a high-level model, represented as a parametric Markov decision process, which is used to plan and analyze compositions of subsystems, and of the collection of low-level subsystems themselves. The subsystems are implemented as deep RL agents operating under partial observability. By defining interfaces between the subsystems, the framework enables automatic decompositions of task specifications, e.g., reach a target set of states with a probability of at least 0.95, into individual subtask specifications, i.e. achieve the subsystem's exit conditions with at least some minimum probability, given that its entry conditions are met. This in turn allows for the independent training and testing of the subsystems. We present theoretical results guaranteeing that if each subsystem learns a policy satisfying its subtask specification, then their composition is guaranteed to satisfy the overall task specification. Conversely, if the subtask specifications cannot all be satisfied by the learned policies, we present a method, formulated as the problem of finding an optimal set of parameters in the high-level model, to automatically update the subtask specifications to account for the observed shortcomings. The result is an iterative procedure for defining subtask specifications, and for training the subsystems to meet them. Experimental results demonstrate the presented framework's novel capabilities in environments with both full and partial observability, discrete and continuous state and action spaces, as well as deterministic and stochastic dynamics."

    "title": "From Small-Gain Theory to Compositional Construction of Barrier Certificates for Large-Scale Stochastic Systems",
    "published_date": "2021-01-18",
    "abstract": "This article is concerned with a compositional approach for the construction of control barrier certificates for large-scale interconnected stochastic systems while synthesizing hybrid controllers against high-level logic properties. Our proposed methodology involves decomposition of interconnected systems into smaller subsystems and leverages the notion of control sub-barrier certificates of subsystems, enabling one to construct control barrier certificates of interconnected systems by employing some $\\max$-type small-gain conditions. The main goal is to synthesize hybrid controllers enforcing complex logic properties, including the ones represented by the accepting language of deterministic finite automata, while providing probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of given specifications in bounded-time horizons. To do so, we propose a systematic approach to first decompose high-level specifications into simple reachability tasks by utilizing automata corresponding to the complement of specifications. We then construct control sub-barrier certificates and synthesize local controllers for those simpler tasks and combine them to obtain a hybrid controller that ensures satisfaction of the complex specification with some lower bound on the probability of satisfaction. We finally apply our proposed techniques to a fully-interconnected Kuramoto network composed of 100 nonlinear oscillators.",
