### Mini Description

Theoretical frameworks for proving how local component properties combine to ensure global system properties, including methods for handling emergent behaviors and complex interactions.

### Description

Composition Theory in AI verification focuses on developing mathematical frameworks that establish how properties verified for individual components combine to guarantee properties of the complete system. This includes both traditional compositional reasoning approaches adapted from software verification and novel techniques specifically designed for machine learning systems, addressing challenges like non-linear interactions, emergent behaviors, and probabilistic guarantees.

A key challenge is handling the complex ways neural networks can exhibit behaviors that aren't simple combinations of their parts. Current research explores various mathematical frameworks, from abstract interpretation and category theory to probabilistic reasoning and information flow analysis, to develop rigorous ways of combining local guarantees into global properties. This includes methods for tracking how uncertainties propagate through compositions and techniques for bounding the impact of component interactions.

Emerging work focuses on developing composition rules that remain valid under distribution shift, handle adaptive components, and account for feedback loops between subsystems. Researchers are particularly interested in frameworks that can reason about emergent properties - system-level behaviors that arise from component interactions but aren't directly verifiable at the component level. This includes developing theories of compositional robustness, stability, and alignment that can scale to increasingly complex AI architectures.
