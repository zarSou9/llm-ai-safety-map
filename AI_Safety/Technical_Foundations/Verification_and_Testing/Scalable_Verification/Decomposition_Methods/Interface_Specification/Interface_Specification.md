### Mini Description

Approaches for defining and verifying the interactions between decomposed components, including contract-based verification and assume-guarantee reasoning frameworks.

### Description

Interface Specification in AI system decomposition focuses on formally defining and verifying the interactions between components of a decomposed system. This involves creating precise mathematical specifications of how components communicate, what assumptions they make about each other, and what guarantees they provide. The challenge lies in capturing complex dependencies and temporal relationships while keeping specifications tractable and verifiable.

Current research explores various specification languages and formalisms, from traditional contract-based approaches to novel frameworks specifically designed for AI systems. These include probabilistic contracts for handling uncertainty, temporal logic specifications for behavioral properties over time, and semantic interfaces that capture high-level functional relationships. A key focus is developing specifications that are both expressive enough to capture relevant properties and amenable to automated verification.

Emerging work addresses the challenge of specification composition, investigating how interface specifications can be combined to reason about system-wide properties. This includes research on compatibility checking between interfaces, verification of emergent properties from component interactions, and techniques for managing specification complexity as systems scale. Particular attention is given to handling non-deterministic behaviors and maintaining robustness guarantees across component boundaries.
