    "title": "Verifiable Reinforcement Learning Systems via Compositionality",
    "published_date": "2023-09-09",
    "abstract": "We propose a framework for verifiable and compositional reinforcement learning (RL) in which a collection of RL subsystems, each of which learns to accomplish a separate subtask, are composed to achieve an overall task. The framework consists of a high-level model, represented as a parametric Markov decision process, which is used to plan and analyze compositions of subsystems, and of the collection of low-level subsystems themselves. The subsystems are implemented as deep RL agents operating under partial observability. By defining interfaces between the subsystems, the framework enables automatic decompositions of task specifications, e.g., reach a target set of states with a probability of at least 0.95, into individual subtask specifications, i.e. achieve the subsystem's exit conditions with at least some minimum probability, given that its entry conditions are met. This in turn allows for the independent training and testing of the subsystems. We present theoretical results guaranteeing that if each subsystem learns a policy satisfying its subtask specification, then their composition is guaranteed to satisfy the overall task specification. Conversely, if the subtask specifications cannot all be satisfied by the learned policies, we present a method, formulated as the problem of finding an optimal set of parameters in the high-level model, to automatically update the subtask specifications to account for the observed shortcomings. The result is an iterative procedure for defining subtask specifications, and for training the subsystems to meet them. Experimental results demonstrate the presented framework's novel capabilities in environments with both full and partial observability, discrete and continuous state and action spaces, as well as deterministic and stochastic dynamics.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a compositional reinforcement learning framework that verifies the overall task's success by guaranteeing individual subsystem success, enabling independent training and iterative refinement of subtask specifications through a high-level planning model. The framework handles various state and action spaces and dynamics, offering theoretical guarantees and empirical validation."

    "abstract": "We propose a framework for verifiable and compositional reinforcement learning (RL) in which a collection of RL subsystems, each of which learns to accomplish a separate subtask, are composed to achieve an overall task. The framework consists of a high-level model, represented as a parametric Markov decision process (pMDP) which is used to plan and to analyze compositions of subsystems, and of the collection of low-level subsystems themselves. By defining interfaces between the subsystems, the framework enables automatic decompositions of task specifications, e.g., reach a target set of states with a probability of at least 0.95, into individual subtask specifications, i.e. achieve the subsystem's exit conditions with at least some minimum probability, given that its entry conditions are met. This in turn allows for the independent training and testing of the subsystems; if they each learn a policy satisfying the appropriate subtask specification, then their composition is guaranteed to satisfy the overall task specification. Conversely, if the subtask specifications cannot all be satisfied by the learned policies, we present a method, formulated as the problem of finding an optimal set of parameters in the pMDP, to automatically update the subtask specifications to account for the observed shortcomings. The result is an iterative procedure for defining subtask specifications, and for training the subsystems to meet them. As an additional benefit, this procedure allows for particularly challenging or important components of an overall task to be identified automatically, and focused on, during training. Experimental results demonstrate the presented framework's novel capabilities in both discrete and continuous RL settings. A collection of RL subsystems are trained, using proximal policy optimization algorithms, to navigate different portions of a labyrinth environment. A cross-labyrinth task specification is then decomposed into subtask specifications. Challenging portions of the labyrinth are automatically avoided if their corresponding subsystems cannot learn satisfactory policies within allowed training budgets. Unnecessary subsystems are not trained at all. The result is a compositional RL system that efficiently learns to satisfy task specifications.",

    "title": "Meta-Sealing: A Revolutionizing Integrity Assurance Protocol for Transparent, Tamper-Proof, and Trustworthy AI System",
    "published_date": "2024-10-31",
    "abstract": "The Artificial intelligence in critical sectors-healthcare, finance, and public safety-has made system integrity paramount for maintaining societal trust. Current verification methods for AI systems lack comprehensive lifecycle assurance, creating significant vulnerabilities in deployment of both powerful and trustworthy AI. This research introduces Meta-Sealing, a cryptographic framework that fundamentally changes integrity verification in AI systems throughout their operational lifetime. Meta-Sealing surpasses traditional integrity protocols through its implementation of cryptographic seal chains, establishing verifiable, immutable records for all system decisions and transformations. The framework combines advanced cryptography with distributed verification, delivering tamper-evident guarantees that achieve both mathematical rigor and computational efficiency. Our implementation addresses urgent regulatory requirements for AI system transparency and auditability. The framework integrates with current AI governance standards, specifically the EU's AI Act and FDA's healthcare AI guidelines, enabling organizations to maintain operational efficiency while meeting compliance requirements. Testing on financial institution data demonstrated Meta-Sealing's capability to reduce audit timeframes by 62% while enhancing stakeholder confidence by 47%. Results can establish a new benchmark for integrity assurance in enterprise AI deployments. This research presents Meta-Sealing not merely as a technical solution, but as a foundational framework ensuring AI system integrity aligns with human values and regulatory requirements. As AI continues to influence critical decisions, provides the necessary bridge between technological advancement and verifiable trust. Meta-Sealing serves as a guardian of trust, ensuring that the AI systems we depend on are as reliable and transparent as they are powerful.",
    "summary": "Meta-Sealing is a novel cryptographic framework providing comprehensive, tamper-proof integrity assurance for AI systems throughout their lifecycle, using cryptographic seal chains to create verifiable records of all system actions and significantly improving audit efficiency and stakeholder trust. It aligns with emerging AI regulations and enhances transparency."

    "title": "Towards AI-Assisted Synthesis of Verified Dafny Methods",
    "abstract": "Large language models show great promise in many domains, including programming. A promise is easy to make but hard to keep, and language models often fail to keep their promises, generating erroneous code. A promising avenue to keep models honest is to incorporate formal verification: generating programs' specifications as well as code so that the code can be proved correct with respect to the specifications. Unfortunately, existing large language models show a severe lack of proficiency in verified programming. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn this paper, we demonstrate how to improve two pretrained models' proficiency in the Dafny verification-aware language. Using 178 problems from the MBPP dataset, we prompt two contemporary models (GPT-4 and PaLM-2) to synthesize Dafny methods. We use three different types of prompts: a direct Contextless prompt; a Signature prompt that includes a method signature and test cases, and a Chain of Thought (CoT) prompt that decomposes the problem into steps and includes retrieval augmentation generated example problems and solutions. Our results show that GPT-4 performs better than PaLM-2 on these tasks and that both models perform best with the retrieval augmentation generated CoT prompt. GPT-4 was able to generate verified, human-evaluated, Dafny methods for 58% of the problems, however, GPT-4 managed only 19% of the problems with the Contextless prompt, and even fewer (10%) for the Signature prompt. We are thus able to contribute 153 verified Dafny solutions to MBPP problems, 50 that we wrote manually, and 103 synthesized by GPT-4. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOur results demonstrate that the benefits of formal program verification are now within reach of code generating large language models. Likewise, program verification systems can benefit from large language models, whether to synthesize code wholesale, to generate specifications, or to act as a \"programmer's verification apprentice\", to construct annotations such as loop invariants which are hard for programmers to write or verification tools to find. Finally, we expect that the approach we have pioneered here — generating candidate solutions that are subsequently formally checked for correctness — should transfer to other domains (e.g., legal arguments, transport signaling, structural engineering) where solutions must be correct, where that correctness must be demonstrated, explained and understood by designers and end-users.",

    "abstract": "In this 4-page manuscript we discuss the problem of long-term AI Safety from a Software Engineering (SE) research viewpoint. We briefly summarize long-term AI Safety, and the challenge of avoiding harms from AI as systems meet or exceed human capabilities, including software engineering capabilities (and approach AGI /\"HLMI\"). We perform a quantified literature review suggesting that AI Safety discussions are not common at SE venues. We make conjectures about how software might change with rising capabilities, and categorize\"subproblems\"which fit into traditional SE areas, proposing how work on similar problems might improve the future of AI and SE.",

    "published_date": "2023-10-02",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we identify and characterize the emerging area of representation engineering (RepE), an approach to enhancing the transparency of AI systems that draws on insights from cognitive neuroscience. RepE places population-level representations, rather than neurons or circuits, at the center of analysis, equipping us with novel methods for monitoring and manipulating high-level cognitive phenomena in deep neural networks (DNNs). We provide baselines and an initial analysis of RepE techniques, showing that they offer simple yet effective solutions for improving our understanding and control of large language models. We showcase how these methods can provide traction on a wide range of safety-relevant problems, including honesty, harmlessness, power-seeking, and more, demonstrating the promise of top-down transparency research. We hope that this work catalyzes further exploration of RepE and fosters advancements in the transparency and safety of AI systems.",
