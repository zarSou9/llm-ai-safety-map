### Mini Description

Approaches that incorporate verification constraints during model training to produce more easily verifiable systems.

### Description

Verification-Aware Training represents an emerging paradigm in AI development where verification requirements are directly incorporated into the model training process, rather than treating verification as a post-hoc concern. This approach aims to produce AI systems that are inherently more amenable to formal verification while maintaining high performance on their primary tasks. By incorporating verification constraints during training, researchers can guide models toward behaviors that are easier to verify or prove properties about.

Current research explores various techniques, including modified loss functions that penalize hard-to-verify behaviors, architectural constraints that enforce verifiable properties, and training procedures that explicitly optimize for both task performance and verifiability metrics. These approaches often involve trading off some model expressiveness or performance for improved verifiability, leading to research on finding optimal balance points and developing techniques that minimize such trade-offs.

A key challenge in this field is developing training objectives that effectively capture verification-relevant properties while remaining differentiable and computationally tractable. Researchers are also investigating how to maintain verification-friendly properties as models scale up in size and capability, and how to handle the interaction between verification constraints and other training objectives such as robustness or interpretability. This includes work on curriculum learning approaches that gradually introduce verification constraints, and methods for adaptively adjusting the strength of verification-related penalties during training.
