### Mini Description

Approaches to making verification techniques computationally tractable for large AI systems, including approximate verification methods and compositional reasoning.

### Description

Scalable Verification addresses the fundamental challenge of verifying properties of increasingly large and complex AI systems while managing computational constraints. As neural networks and other AI architectures grow in size and sophistication, traditional verification methods become computationally intractable, necessitating novel approaches that can scale effectively without sacrificing rigorous guarantees.

Current research focuses on developing approximate verification techniques that provide meaningful bounds on system behavior while remaining computationally feasible. This includes methods for decomposing large networks into more manageable components, leveraging statistical guarantees when complete verification is impossible, and developing hierarchical approaches that can verify properties at different levels of abstraction. Researchers are also exploring ways to incorporate verification considerations into the training process itself, potentially making post-hoc verification more tractable.

A key challenge is balancing the trade-off between computational efficiency and the strength of verification guarantees. This has led to research in adaptive verification strategies that allocate computational resources based on risk assessment, as well as the development of specialized hardware and software optimizations for verification tasks. The field is particularly interested in approaches that can scale super-linearly with model size, as this is crucial for verifying future, more capable systems.
