### Mini Description

Development and selection of appropriate monitoring signals, including behavioral metrics, internal state indicators, and performance measures that can effectively detect potential safety violations or anomalous behaviors.

### Description

Metrics and Indicators in AI safety monitoring encompasses the identification, development, and validation of quantitative and qualitative measures that can effectively track AI system behavior and internal states. These measures must capture both obvious failure modes and subtle deviations that might indicate emerging safety concerns, while being computationally tractable and interpretable enough for practical use. The challenge lies in selecting indicators that are both comprehensive enough to detect potential issues and specific enough to minimize false alarms.

Current research focuses on developing metrics that can track various aspects of AI systems, from low-level computational patterns to high-level behavioral characteristics. This includes measures of uncertainty in model predictions, indicators of distribution shift, metrics for detecting optimization pressure, and signals that might indicate capability gain or emergent behaviors. Researchers are particularly interested in developing robust indicators that remain meaningful as systems become more capable and potentially develop new behaviors or capabilities.

A key area of investigation is the development of composite metrics that can integrate multiple signals to provide early warning of potential issues. This involves understanding the correlations between different indicators, identifying leading indicators of safety-relevant behaviors, and developing methods to combine multiple metrics into meaningful risk assessments. There is also significant work on ensuring metrics remain calibrated and meaningful over time, particularly in the face of distribution shift or system adaptation.
