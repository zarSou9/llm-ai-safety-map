### Mini Description

Methods specifically focused on detecting changes in AI system capabilities, including emergence of new behaviors or unexpected improvements in performance.

### Description

Capability Monitoring focuses on detecting and measuring changes in AI system capabilities, particularly the emergence of new skills, behaviors, or performance improvements that weren't explicitly trained for or expected. This includes tracking both gradual improvements through learning and sudden capability jumps that might indicate fundamental shifts in system behavior or understanding.

A central challenge is defining and measuring capabilities in a way that captures meaningful changes while avoiding false positives from surface-level improvements. This requires developing frameworks for capability assessment that can distinguish between genuine novel capabilities and mere recombinations of existing skills. Researchers must also address the challenge of monitoring for capabilities that might manifest only in specific contexts or through subtle behavioral changes.

Current research emphasizes developing systematic approaches to capability evaluation across different domains, including language understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving. Particular attention is paid to detecting signs of potential deception or capability concealment, where systems might learn to strategically hide or misrepresent their true capabilities. This includes work on developing robust testing protocols and monitoring frameworks that remain effective even as systems become more sophisticated.
