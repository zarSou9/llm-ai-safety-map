    "title": "A Causal Approach to Detecting Multivariate Time-series Anomalies and Root Causes",
    "published_date": "2022-06-30",
    "abstract": "Detecting anomalies and the corresponding root causes in multivariate time series plays an important role in monitoring the behaviors of various real-world systems, e.g., IT system operations or manufacturing industry. Previous anomaly detection approaches model the joint distribution without considering the underlying mechanism of multivariate time series, making them computationally hungry and hard to identify root causes. In this paper, we formulate the anomaly detection problem from a causal perspective and view anomalies as instances that do not follow the regular causal mechanism to generate the multivariate data. We then propose a causality-based framework for detecting anomalies and root causes. It first learns the causal structure from data and then infers whether an instance is an anomaly relative to the local causal mechanism whose conditional distribution can be directly estimated from data. In light of the modularity property of causal systems (the causal processes to generate different variables are irrelevant modules), the original problem is divided into a series of separate, simpler, and low-dimensional anomaly detection problems so that where an anomaly happens (root causes) can be directly identified. We evaluate our approach with both simulated and public datasets as well as a case study on real-world AIOps applications, showing its efficacy, robustness, and practical feasibility.",

    "title": "Root Cause Identification for Collective Anomalies in Time Series given an Acyclic Summary Causal Graph with Loops",
    "published_date": "2023-03-07",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for identifying the root causes of collective anomalies given observational time series and an acyclic summary causal graph which depicts an abstraction of causal relations present in a dynamic system at its normal regime. The paper first shows how the problem of root cause identification can be divided into many independent subproblems by grouping related anomalies using d-separation. Further, it shows how, under this setting, some root causes can be found directly from the graph and from the time of appearance of anomalies. Finally, it shows, how the rest of the root causes can be found by comparing direct effects in the normal and in the anomalous regime. To this end, an adjustment set for identifying direct effects is introduced. Extensive experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "title": "Causality-Aided Trade-Off Analysis for Machine Learning Fairness",
    "published_date": "2023-05-22",
    "abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in enhancing the fairness of machine learning (ML). Despite the growing number of fairness-improving methods, we lack a systematic understanding of the trade-offs among factors considered in the ML pipeline when fairness-improving methods are applied. This understanding is essential for developers to make informed decisions regarding the provision of fair ML services. Nonetheless, it is extremely difficult to analyze the trade-offs when there are multiple fairness parameters and other crucial metrics involved, coupled, and even in conflict with one another. This paper uses causality analysis as a principled method for analyzing trade-offs between fairness parameters and other crucial metrics in ML pipelines. To practically and effectively conduct causality analysis, we propose a set of domain-specific optimizations to facilitate accurate causal discovery and a unified, novel interface for trade-off analysis based on well-established causal inference methods. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study using three real-world datasets on a collection of widely-used fairness-improving techniques. Our study obtains actionable suggestions for users and developers of fair ML. We further demonstrate the versatile usage of our approach in selecting the optimal fairness-improving method, paving the way for more ethical and socially responsible AI technologies.",

    "title": "Towards Learning and Explaining Indirect Causal Effects in Neural Networks",
    "published_date": "2023-03-24",
    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in learning and explaining causal effects within Neural Network (NN) models. By virtue of NN architectures, previous approaches consider only direct and total causal effects assuming independence among input variables. We view an NN as a structural causal model (SCM) and extend our focus to include indirect causal effects by introducing feedforward connections among input neurons. We propose an ante-hoc method that captures and maintains direct, indirect, and total causal effects during NN model training. We also propose an algorithm for quantifying learned causal effects in an NN model and efficient approximation strategies for quantifying causal effects in high-dimensional data. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the causal effects learned by our ante-hoc method better approximate the ground truth effects compared to existing methods."
