    "title": "Integrating Graceful Degradation and Recovery Through Requirement-Driven Adaptation",
    "published_date": "2024-01-18",
    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to environmental uncertainties such as adverse operating conditions, malicious attacks, and hardware degradation. These uncertainties may lead to failures that put the system in a sub-optimal or unsafe state. Systems that are resilient to such uncertainties rely on two types of operations: (1) graceful degradation, for ensuring that the system maintains an acceptable level of safety during unexpected environmental conditions and (2) recovery, to facilitate the resumption of normal system functions. Typically, mechanisms for degradation and recovery are developed independently from each other, and later integrated into a system, requiring the designer to develop an additional, ad-hoc logic for activating and coordinating between the two operations. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptation approach for improving system resiliency through automated triggering and coordination of graceful degradation and recovery. The key idea behind our approach is to treat degradation and recovery as requirement-driven adaptation tasks: Degradation can be thought of as temporarily weakening original (i.e., ideal) system requirements to be achieved by the system, and recovery as strengthening the weakened requirements when the environment returns within an expected operating boundary. Furthermore, by treating weakening and strengthening as dual operations, we argue that a single requirement-based adaptation method is sufficient to enable coordination between degradation and recovery. Given system requirements specified in signal temporal logic (STL), we propose a run-time adaptation framework that performs degradation and recovery in response to environmental changes. We describe a prototype implementation of our framework and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach using a case study in unmanned underwater vehicles."

    "title": "Barriers on the EDGE: A scalable CBF architecture over EDGE for safe aerial-ground multi-agent coordination",
    "published_date": "2024-11-25",
    "abstract": "In this article, we address the problem of designing a scalable control architecture for a safe coordinated operation of a multi-agent system with aerial (UAVs) and ground robots (UGVs) in a confined task space. The proposed method uses Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to impose constraints associated with (i) collision avoidance between agents, (ii) landing of UAVs on mobile UGVs, and (iii) task space restriction. Further, to account for the rapid increase in the number of constraints for a single agent with the increasing number of agents, the proposed architecture uses a centralized-decentralized Edge cluster, where a centralized node (Watcher) activates the relevant constraints, reducing the need for high onboard processing and network complexity. The distributed nodes run the controller locally to overcome latency and network issues. The proposed Edge architecture is experimentally validated using multiple aerial and ground robots in a confined environment performing a coordinated operation."

    "title": "Pricing cyber-insurance for systems via maturity models",
    "published_date": "2023-02-09",
    "abstract": "Pricing insurance for risks associated with information technology systems presents a complex modelling challenge, combining the disciplines of operations management, security, and economics. This work proposes a socioeconomic modelling framework for cyber-insurance decisions compromised of entity relationship diagrams, security maturity models, and economic models, addressing a long-standing research challenge of capturing organizational structure in the design and pricing of cyber-insurance policies. Insurance pricing is usually informed by the long experience insurance companies have of the magnitude and frequency of losses that arise in organizations based on their size, industry sector, and location. Consequently, their calculations of premia will start from a baseline determined by these considerations. A unique challenge of cyber-insurance is that data history is limited and not necessarily informative of future loss risk meaning that established actuarial methodology for other lines of insurance may not be the optimal pricing strategy. The modelling framework proposed in this paper provides a vehicle for agreement between practitioners in the cyber-insurance ecosystem on cyber-security risks and allows for the users to choose their desired level of abstraction in the description of a system.",

    "title": "Multi-AI Complex Systems in Humanitarian Response",
    "published_date": "2022-08-24",
    "abstract": "AI is being increasingly used to aid response efforts to humanitarian emergencies at multiple levels of decision-making. Such AI systems are generally understood to be stand-alone tools for decision support, with ethical assessments, guidelines and frameworks applied to them through this lens. However, as the prevalence of AI increases in this domain, such systems will begin to encounter each other through information flow networks created by interacting decision-making entities, leading to multi-AI complex systems which are often ill understood. In this paper we describe how these multi-AI systems can arise, even in relatively simple real-world humanitarian response scenarios, and lead to potentially emergent and erratic erroneous behavior. We discuss how we can better work towards more trustworthy multi-AI systems by exploring some of the associated challenges and opportunities, and how we can design better mechanisms to understand and assess such systems. This paper is designed to be a first exposition on this topic in the field of humanitarian response, raising awareness, exploring the possible landscape of this domain, and providing a starting point for future work within the wider community."

    "published_date": "2021-03-24",
    "abstract": "Increased complexity in cyber-physical systems calls for modular system design methodologies that guarantee correct and reliable behavior, both in normal operations and in the presence of failures. This paper aims to extend the contract-based design approach using a directive-response architecture to enable reactivity to failure scenarios. The architecture is demonstrated on a modular automated valet parking (AVP) system. The contracts for the different components in the AVP system are explicitly defined, implemented, and validated against a Python implementation."
