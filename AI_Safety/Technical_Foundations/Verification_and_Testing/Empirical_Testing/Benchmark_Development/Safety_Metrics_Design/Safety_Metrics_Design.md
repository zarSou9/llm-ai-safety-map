### Mini Description

Development of quantitative measures and evaluation criteria for assessing specific safety-relevant capabilities and behaviors in AI systems.

### Description

Safety Metrics Design focuses on developing quantitative measures that can effectively evaluate and compare AI systems' adherence to safety properties. This involves creating metrics that capture both explicit safety requirements (like robustness bounds or performance constraints) and more nuanced aspects of safe behavior (such as value alignment or deception avoidance). A key challenge is designing metrics that are both mathematically rigorous and practically meaningful, while avoiding Goodhart's Law where optimization for the metric leads to unintended behaviors.

Current research emphasizes the development of compositional metrics that can assess multiple safety properties simultaneously while accounting for their interactions. This includes work on uncertainty-aware metrics that capture confidence levels in safety assessments, relative metrics that compare system behaviors against human preferences or baseline models, and contextual metrics that evaluate safety properties under different deployment scenarios. Researchers are particularly focused on creating metrics that can detect subtle failure modes and emergent unsafe behaviors.

A central open question is how to design metrics that remain meaningful as AI systems become more capable. This involves developing theoretical frameworks for safety measurement that scale with system complexity, creating metrics that can assess higher-order safety properties like corrigibility or transparency, and establishing methods to validate the metrics themselves. The field is also exploring ways to combine multiple metrics into comprehensive safety scores while maintaining interpretability and avoiding oversimplification of complex safety considerations.
