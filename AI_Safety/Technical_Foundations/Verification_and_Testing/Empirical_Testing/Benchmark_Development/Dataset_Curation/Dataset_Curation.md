### Mini Description

Collection and organization of representative test cases and scenarios that effectively probe safety-critical aspects of AI system behavior.

### Description

Dataset Curation for AI safety benchmarks involves the systematic collection, organization, and maintenance of test cases that effectively evaluate safety-critical behaviors in AI systems. This process requires careful consideration of dataset composition to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential failure modes while maintaining dataset quality, relevance, and statistical validity. Key challenges include selecting representative examples, avoiding harmful biases, and ensuring the dataset remains challenging as AI capabilities advance.

The curation process typically involves multiple stages: identifying relevant safety scenarios, collecting or generating appropriate test cases, validating their quality and correctness, and organizing them into meaningful categories. Researchers must balance various factors such as dataset diversity, difficulty progression, and the need to test both common and edge cases. Special attention is given to documenting dataset properties, including known limitations and potential biases, to ensure appropriate use in safety evaluations.

Current research focuses on developing systematic approaches to dataset construction that can capture subtle safety issues and complex failure modes. This includes methods for generating synthetic data to test specific safety properties, techniques for identifying and filling gaps in coverage, and approaches to maintaining dataset relevance over time. Open challenges include creating datasets that can effectively test for deceptive behavior, developing methods to validate dataset difficulty, and ensuring datasets remain challenging for increasingly capable AI systems.
