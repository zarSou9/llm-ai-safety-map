### Mini Description

Systematic approaches to testing AI systems through carefully designed experiments, including adversarial testing, stress testing, and behavioral testing across diverse scenarios.

### Description

Empirical Testing in AI safety focuses on systematically evaluating AI systems through carefully designed experiments and test scenarios to uncover potential failure modes, behavioral limitations, and safety vulnerabilities. This approach complements formal verification by providing practical evidence of system behavior under various conditions and identifying issues that may not be apparent through theoretical analysis alone.

Key methodologies include constructing comprehensive test suites that probe different aspects of system behavior, developing standardized benchmarks for safety-relevant capabilities, and creating adversarial scenarios that stress-test system limitations. Researchers employ techniques such as metamorphic testing to generate related test cases, combinatorial testing to efficiently explore interaction effects, and systematic perturbation analysis to understand system robustness. The field also emphasizes the importance of testing for emergent behaviors and potential failure modes that may only appear in specific contexts or through complex interactions.

A central challenge is ensuring adequate coverage of the vast space of possible scenarios while maintaining computational tractability. This has led to the development of targeted testing strategies that focus on safety-critical behaviors and potential edge cases. Researchers are particularly interested in developing methods for testing AI systems' alignment with human values, their behavior under distribution shift, and their response to adversarial inputs. Current open questions include how to effectively test for deceptive behavior, how to validate systems' performance on long-term planning tasks, and how to ensure test results remain relevant as systems become more capable.
