### Mini Description

Methods for testing AI systems through carefully crafted sequences of interactions designed to expose behavioral weaknesses or manipulate system responses over time.

### Description

Strategic Interaction testing focuses on evaluating AI systems through extended sequences of interactions designed to expose behavioral weaknesses, alignment failures, or manipulation vulnerabilities that may not be apparent from single-input testing. This approach draws from game theory, cognitive science, and social psychology to design scenarios that probe an AI system's decision-making processes, adaptation capabilities, and potential for deceptive or unintended behaviors over time.

Current research emphasizes developing systematic methods for constructing interaction sequences that can reveal subtle failure modes, such as reward hacking, specification gaming, or goal misgeneralization. This includes creating multi-step scenarios that test an AI system's ability to maintain consistent behavior under pressure, handle conflicting objectives, and respond appropriately to attempts at manipulation or deception. Researchers are particularly interested in understanding how systems might behave differently when they recognize they are being tested versus during normal operation.

A key challenge is designing test scenarios that effectively balance complexity with interpretability, ensuring that observed behaviors can be meaningfully analyzed while still capturing realistic interaction patterns. This includes questions about how to systematically explore the space of possible interaction sequences, how to identify and characterize emergent behaviors that arise over multiple steps, and how to develop metrics for evaluating system performance in extended interactions. The field also grapples with the challenge of creating test scenarios that can provide insight into potential failure modes of more advanced systems, particularly in multi-agent settings where strategic complexity increases dramatically.
