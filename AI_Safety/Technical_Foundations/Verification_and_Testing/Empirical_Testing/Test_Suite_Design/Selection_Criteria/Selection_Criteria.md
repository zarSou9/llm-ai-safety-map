### Mini Description

Frameworks and methodologies for determining which test cases should be included in a suite to maximize effectiveness while maintaining manageable size.

### Description

Selection Criteria in AI safety test suite design focuses on developing principled frameworks for determining which test cases should be included in a test suite to maximize its effectiveness in evaluating AI system safety. This involves balancing multiple competing objectives, including coverage of potential failure modes, computational efficiency, and the ability to detect subtle alignment issues. The criteria must account for both known risks and potential emergent behaviors that may arise as systems become more capable.

Current approaches draw from traditional software testing methodologies while adapting to the unique challenges of AI systems. These include risk-based selection methods that prioritize testing of safety-critical behaviors, diversity-driven approaches that ensure broad coverage of behavioral space, and complexity-based criteria that focus on challenging edge cases. Researchers are particularly interested in developing criteria that can effectively identify test cases likely to expose alignment failures or unexpected emergent behaviors.

Key open challenges include determining how to select test cases that remain relevant as AI capabilities increase, developing criteria that can effectively evaluate long-term planning and strategic behavior, and creating methods to assess the completeness of selected test cases. There is also significant work on developing automated methods for test case selection that can adapt to new information about system behavior and potential risks.
