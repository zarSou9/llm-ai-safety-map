### Mini Description

Development of comprehensive test collections that systematically probe different aspects of AI system behavior, including edge cases, corner cases, and safety-critical scenarios.

### Description

Test Suite Design in AI safety focuses on creating structured collections of test cases that systematically evaluate AI systems across different dimensions of behavior and capability. This involves identifying key behavioral aspects that need testing, developing methodologies for generating representative test cases, and organizing tests to provide meaningful coverage of potential failure modes. The design process must balance comprehensiveness with practicality, ensuring that test suites are both thorough and computationally feasible to execute.

A central challenge is determining appropriate test case selection criteria that can effectively probe both known and potential failure modes. This includes developing methods for generating diverse scenarios that test system boundaries, identifying minimal test cases that expose specific behaviors, and creating hierarchical test structures that can scale with system complexity. Researchers must also consider how to design test suites that remain relevant as AI systems become more capable, potentially exhibiting new behaviors or failure modes not covered by existing tests.

Current research emphasizes the importance of principled approaches to test case generation, including techniques from software testing like equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, adapted for the unique challenges of AI systems. Open questions include how to systematically generate test cases for complex multi-step behaviors, how to design tests that can detect subtle alignment failures, and how to validate that test suites themselves are reliable indicators of system safety.
