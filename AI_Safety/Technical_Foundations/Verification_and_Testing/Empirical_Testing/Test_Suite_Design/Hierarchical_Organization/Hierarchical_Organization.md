### Mini Description

Approaches to structuring test suites in ways that facilitate maintenance, reuse, and systematic coverage of behavioral space at different levels of abstraction.

### Description

Hierarchical Organization in test suite design focuses on structuring AI safety test cases into logical, manageable layers that facilitate systematic testing and maintenance. This approach allows for organizing tests at different levels of abstraction - from basic unit tests of individual components to complex integration tests of emergent behaviors. The hierarchical structure helps manage complexity by enabling both targeted testing of specific capabilities and comprehensive evaluation of system-wide properties.

A key challenge is determining appropriate abstraction boundaries that maintain meaningful separation between test levels while capturing important interactions. This includes designing interfaces between test layers that allow for composition of simpler tests into more complex scenarios, developing dependency management systems that track relationships between different test levels, and creating mechanisms for propagating test results across the hierarchy. Researchers must balance the benefits of modularity against the need to detect emergent behaviors that may only arise from specific combinations of components.

Current research explores methods for automatically generating hierarchical test structures based on system architecture and behavioral specifications, developing formal frameworks for reasoning about test coverage across different abstraction levels, and creating adaptive testing strategies that can evolve the hierarchy as systems become more capable. Open questions include how to optimally partition the test space into levels, how to maintain consistency across the hierarchy as systems change, and how to ensure that the hierarchical structure itself doesn't inadvertently mask important system behaviors.
