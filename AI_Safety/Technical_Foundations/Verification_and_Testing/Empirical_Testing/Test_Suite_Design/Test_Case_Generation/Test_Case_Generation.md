### Mini Description

Methods and algorithms for automatically or semi-automatically creating diverse, relevant test cases that probe different aspects of system behavior.

### Description

Test Case Generation focuses on developing automated and semi-automated methods for creating diverse, meaningful test cases that evaluate AI systems' behavior. This involves combining insights from traditional software testing with novel approaches suited to the unique challenges of AI systems, such as their statistical nature, emergent behaviors, and potential for unexpected failure modes. Key challenges include generating test cases that effectively probe edge cases and corner cases while maintaining computational feasibility.

Current research emphasizes both systematic and stochastic approaches to test case generation. Systematic methods include techniques like metamorphic testing, which generates new test cases by applying behavior-preserving transformations to existing ones, and constraint-based generation, which derives test cases from formal specifications of desired properties. Stochastic approaches leverage techniques like genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning to explore the space of possible inputs, often guided by coverage metrics or specific testing objectives.

A central focus is developing methods that can generate test cases for increasingly complex behaviors and failure modes. This includes techniques for generating multi-step scenarios that test long-term planning and decision-making, approaches for creating adversarial examples that probe system robustness, and methods for generating test cases that can detect subtle alignment failures. Open questions include how to generate test cases that remain relevant as AI systems become more capable, how to ensure generated tests are interpretable to human reviewers, and how to validate that generated test cases effectively probe intended behaviors.
