    "title": "Case-Based Approach to Detect Emergence",
    "abstract": "In recent years the concept of emergence has captured significant attention in the field of complex systems. However, it is difficult to predict, detect and control emergent phenomena. This prevents us from exploring its full potential. The research effort in this paper focuses on detecting emergent behaviours by proposing a new approach inspired by Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). The approach lies in four items: (1) The use of this kind of reasoning in order to detect Emergence in these systems, (2) A Case is represented inspired by Causal Temporal Signature (CTS) which are adapted in complex systems, (3) The use of Simulation and data formalism to transform data from simulation into two forms (Normal, Emergent), (4) Reasoning and learning to diagnose the system and detect unexpected/unwanted system state, furthermore, the update of the data base of cases when a new unknown behaviour appears. Since this is a part of on-going research, future direction is also discussed.",

    "title": "Group activity recognition using belief propagation for wearable devices",
    "abstract": "Humans are social beings and spend most of their time in groups. Group behavior is emergent, generated by members' personal characteristics and their interactions. It is therefore difficult to recognize in peer-to-peer (P2P) systems where the emergent behavior itself cannot be directly observed. We introduce 2 novel algorithms for distributed probabilistic inference (DPI) of group activities using loopy belief propagation (LBP). We evaluate their performance using an experiment in which 10 individuals play 6 team sports and show that these activities are emergent in nature through natural processes. Centralized recognition performs very well, upwards of an F-score of 0.95 for large window sizes. The distributed methods iteratively converge to solutions which are comparable to centralized methods. DPI-LBP also reduces energy consumption by a factor of 7 to 40, where a centralized unit or infrastructure is not required.",
