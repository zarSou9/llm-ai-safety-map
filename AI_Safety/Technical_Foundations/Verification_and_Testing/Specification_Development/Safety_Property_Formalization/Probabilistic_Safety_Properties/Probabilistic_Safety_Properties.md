### Mini Description

Mathematical frameworks for expressing safety requirements under uncertainty, including probabilistic bounds, statistical guarantees, and risk-aware constraints.

### Description

Probabilistic Safety Properties focuses on developing mathematical frameworks for specifying and verifying safety requirements in AI systems under uncertainty. This includes formulating probabilistic bounds on system behavior, defining statistical guarantees for safety-critical properties, and creating verifiable constraints that account for the inherent stochasticity in both AI systems and their environments. The field draws on probability theory, statistical learning theory, and formal methods to create rigorous specifications that remain meaningful in the presence of uncertainty.

A key challenge is balancing the trade-off between the strength of safety guarantees and their practical verifiability. Strong probabilistic guarantees often require assumptions that may not hold in practice or are computationally intractable to verify. This has led to research on approximate verification methods, concentration inequalities, and probabilistic reasoning frameworks that can provide meaningful but achievable safety guarantees. Researchers are particularly focused on developing properties that remain robust under distribution shift and can handle the complex uncertainty patterns that emerge in deep learning systems.

Current research emphasizes the development of scalable approaches for specifying and verifying probabilistic properties in large AI systems. This includes work on compositional methods for combining local probabilistic guarantees into system-wide properties, techniques for handling epistemic uncertainty in safety specifications, and frameworks for reasoning about the reliability of safety properties over time. There is particular interest in methods that can provide meaningful guarantees even when training and deployment distributions differ, or when systems exhibit emergent behaviors not seen during testing.
