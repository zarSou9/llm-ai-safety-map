    "title": "Immersion and Invariance-Based Disturbance Observer and Its Application to Safe Control",
    "published_date": "2023-09-13",
    "abstract": "When the disturbance input matrix is nonlinear, existing disturbance observer design methods rely on the solvability of a partial differential equation or the existence of an output function with a uniformly well-defined disturbance relative degree, which can pose significant limitations. This note introduces a systematic approach for designing an immersion and invariance-based disturbance observer (IIDOB) that circumvents these strong assumptions. The proposed IIDOB ensures the disturbance estimation error is globally uniformly ultimately bounded by approximately solving a partial differential equation while compensating for the approximation error. Furthermore, by integrating IIDOB into the framework of control barrier functions, a filter-based safe control design method for control-affine systems with disturbances is established, where the filter is used to generate an alternative disturbance estimation signal with a known derivative. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the safety of the disturbed systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "title": "Affine Disjunctive Invariant Generation with Farkas' Lemma",
    "published_date": "2023-07-25",
    "abstract": "In the verification of loop programs, disjunctive invariants are essential to capture complex loop dynamics such as phase and mode changes. In this work, we develop a novel approach for the automated generation of affine disjunctive invariants for affine while loops via Farkas' Lemma, a fundamental theorem on linear inequalities. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we combine Farkas' Lemma with a succinct control flow transformation to derive disjunctive invariants from the conditional branches in the loop. Second, we propose an invariant propagation technique that minimizes the invariant computation effort by propagating previously solved invariants to yet unsolved locations as much as possible. Furthermore, we resolve the infeasibility checking in the application of Farkas' Lemma which has not been addressed previously, and extend our approach to nested loops via loop summary. Experimental evaluation over more than 100 affine while loops (mostly from SV-COMP 2023) demonstrates that our approach is promising to generate tight linear invariants over affine programs."

    "title": "Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Control Barrier Function using Conditional Value-at-Risk with Differentiable Convex Programming",
    "published_date": "2023-09-15",
    "abstract": "Control Barrier functions (CBFs) have attracted extensive attention for designing safe controllers for their deployment in real-world safety-critical systems. However, the perception of the surrounding environment is often subject to stochasticity and further distributional shift from the nominal one. In this paper, we present distributional robust CBF (DR-CBF) to achieve resilience under distributional shift while keeping the advantages of CBF, such as computational efficacy and forward invariance. To achieve this goal, we first propose a single-level convex reformulation to estimate the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of the safety constraints under distributional shift measured by a Wasserstein metric, which is by nature tri-level programming. Moreover, to construct a control barrier condition to enforce the forward invariance of the CVaR, the technique of differentiable convex programming is applied to enable differentiation through the optimization layer of CVaR estimation. We also provide an approximate variant of DR-CBF for higher-order systems. Simulation results are presented to validate the chance-constrained safety guarantee under the distributional shift in both first and second-order systems.",
