    "title": "Formal Modeling and Verification of Publisher-Subscriber Paradigm in ROS 2",
    "published_date": "2024-12-12",
    "abstract": "The Robot Operating System (ROS) is one of the most popular middleware for developing robot applications, but it is subject to major shortcomings when applied to real-time robotic systems in safety-critical environments. For this reason, ROS 2 was released in 2017 for implementing real-time capabilities in distributed robotic systems while supporting the most prominent aspects of the original ROS. There is still not much work done to provide formal guarantees and correctness of a ROS program. In this paper, we propose a framework to address this challenging problem of guaranteeing the correct behaviour of robotic systems. We propose a formal modelling of a ROS 2 program, and also describe the program using a network of timed automata. We then prove that the sets of executions of a ROS program in the model and in the network of timed automata are the same. Thus to analyze a publisher-subscriber scenario of ROS 2 program, our algorithm first converts the program into the model, and then into the network of timed automata. The applicability and validity of our approach are verified by conducting several experiments on a simplified system and an actual robotic system, and the results and limitations are discussed.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a framework for formally verifying the correctness of ROS 2 publisher-subscriber programs by modeling them as networks of timed automata, proving equivalence between the model and the program's execution, and validating the approach through experiments on simplified and real robotic systems."

    "summary": "This article presents a proof of a variant of Gödel's completeness theorem using sequent calculus, aiming for intuitive understanding rather than symbolic manipulation. The proof relies on a first-order theory with a countably infinite set of constants not appearing in axioms, and defines models and inference rules to demonstrate completeness."

    "title": "Joint Learning of Policy with Unknown Temporal Constraints for Safe Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2023-04-30",
    "abstract": "In many real-world applications, safety constraints for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are either unknown or not explicitly defined. We propose a framework that concurrently learns safety constraints and optimal RL policies in such environments, supported by theoretical guarantees. Our approach merges a logically-constrained RL algorithm with an evolutionary algorithm to synthesize signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. The framework is underpinned by theorems that establish the convergence of our joint learning process and provide error bounds between the discovered policy and the true optimal policy. We showcased our framework in grid-world environments, successfully identifying both acceptable safety constraints and RL policies while demonstrating the effectiveness of our theorems in practice.",

    "title": "Specification synthesis with constrained Horn clauses",
    "abstract": "The problem of synthesizing specifications of undefined procedures has a broad range of applications, but the usefulness of the generated specifications depends on their quality. In this paper, we propose a technique for finding maximal and non-vacuous specifications. Maximality allows for more choices for implementations of undefined procedures, and non-vacuity ensures that safety assertions are reachable. To handle programs with complex control flow, our technique discovers not only specifications but also inductive invariants. Our iterative algorithm lazily generalizes non-vacuous specifications in a counterexample-guided loop. The key component of our technique is an effective non-vacuous specification synthesis algorithm. We have implemented the approach in a tool called HornSpec, taking as input systems of constrained Horn clauses. We have experimentally demonstrated the tool's effectiveness, efficiency, and the quality of generated specifications on a range of benchmarks.",

    "title": "Formal Synthesis of Controllers for Uncertain Linear Systems Against -Regular Properties: A Set-Based Approach",
    "published_date": "2021-11-16",
    "abstract": "In this article, we present how to synthesize controllers to enforce <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\omega$</tex-math></inline-formula>-regular properties over linear control systems affected by bounded disturbances. In particular, these controllers are synthesized based on so-called hybrid controlled invariant (HCI) sets. To compute these sets, we first construct a product system between the linear control system and the deterministic Streett automata (DSA) modeling the desired property. Then, we propose a set-based approach, which exploits a new iterative scheme over <italic>hybrid</italic> state sets of the product system, to compute the maximal HCI set. To ensure the termination of the iterative scheme within a finite number of steps, we propose two alternative approaches to compute approximations of the maximal HCI set. Moreover, we show the relations between the (worst-case) complexities of the proposed iterative schemes over hybrid sets and the structure of the DSA modeling <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\omega$</tex-math></inline-formula>-regular properties. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our results via two case studies.",

    "title": "Validation Obligations: A Novel Approach to Check Compliance between Requirements and their Formal Specification",
    "published_date": "2021-02-11",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, practitioners use formal methods pre-dominately for one half of the quality-assurance process: verification (do we build the software right?). The other half - validation (do we build the right software?) - has been given comparatively little attention. While verification is the core of refinement-based formal methods, where each new refinement step must preserve all properties of its abstract model, validation is usually postponed until the latest stages of the development, when models can be automatically executed. Thus mistakes in requirementsor in their interpretation are caught too late: usually at the endof the development process. In this paper, we present a novelapproach to check compliance between requirements and theirformal refinement-based specification during the earlier stages ofdevelopment. Our proposed approach - \"validation obligations\"- is based on the simple idea that both verification and validationare an integral part of all refinement steps of a system.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces \"validation obligations,\" a novel approach integrating validation with verification in each refinement step of formal methods, addressing the traditionally neglected aspect of ensuring that formal specifications accurately reflect requirements early in software development. This contrasts with the common practice of delaying validation until later stages."

    "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on Specification and Design Languages (FDL 2019)",
    "abstract": "The Forum on Specification and Design Languages (FDL) is a well-established international venue to exchange experiences and promote new trends in the application of languages, their associated design methods, and tools for the design of electronic systems. Electronic systems of interest to FDL include (but are not limited to) those that are used in Internet of Things (IoT), CyberPhysical Systems, mixed criticality embedded systems, embedded systems for high-performance computing and driver assistance, real-time systems, and reconfigurable and secure computing. FDL 2019 was held in Southampton, UK, September 2–4, bringing together 44 researchers and practicioners from 10 countries. The three keynotes covered themes ranging from designing heterogeneous domain-specific languages and compilers (David Broman, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm) over balancing implementability, understandability, and expressiveness in language design (Stephen A. Edwards, Columbia University, New York) to formal languages for embedded critical software (Marc Pouzet, École Normale Supérieure, Paris). In addition, the technical program of FDL 2019 contained two tutorials, two panels, and six technical sessions with a total of 26 presentations. To allow for more in-depth treatment of selected contributions and to further broaden the audience, an open call was made for this special issue in ACM TECS. As a result, six updated and extended papers from FDL'19 are included here, joined by a seventh paper on original work not presented at FDL before. “SystemC implementation of Stochastic Petri Nets for Parametrization of Biological Networks” is authored by Nicola Bombieri, Silvia Scaffeo, Antonio Mastrandrea, Simone Caligola, Tommaso Carlucci, Franco Fummi, Carlo Laudanna, Gabriela Constantin, and Rosalba Giugno. This multidisciplinary paper presents a framework for the modeling and simulation of biological network using Stochastic Petri Nets. To achieve automatic model parametrization, the Stochastic Petri Nets model is implemented into SystemC code, while user-defined properties are specified with a formal specification language. Then, Dynamic Assertion-Based Verification is used to synthesize an appropriate network and parameter configuration that satisfies the defined properties. This allows the system to be simulated under different conditions and network properties. “Event-B Hybridation: A Proof and Refinement Based Framework for Modelling Hybrid Systems,” by Guillaume Dupont, Yamine Ait-Ameur, Marc Pantel, and Neeraj Singh, is an original work not presented at FDL '19. It addresses the difficult topic of the formal proof (in the proof assistant sense) and the incremental design of hybrid systems. The underlying proof assistant is the Rodin Proof Manager and its associated programming language Event-B (based on the B method by Abrial). Hybrid systems are modeled as standard hybrid automata with simple differential equations, which is classical. The strong point of the proposed approach is that the proof obligations",
