### Mini Description

Frameworks for expressing boundaries, limitations, and constraints on AI system behavior, including safety envelopes and operational restrictions.

### Description

Constraint Description Languages (CDLs) in AI safety focus on formal frameworks for expressing explicit boundaries and limitations on AI system behavior. These languages provide precise ways to specify what actions or states are permitted or forbidden, operating conditions, resource usage limits, and other operational constraints. Unlike more general specification languages, CDLs are specifically designed to capture clear, enforceable restrictions that can be actively monitored and enforced during system operation.

Current research in CDLs explores various approaches to constraint representation, from simple bound constraints on numerical values to complex geometric safety envelopes in high-dimensional state spaces. Key challenges include developing constraints that remain meaningful under system learning and adaptation, handling constraint composition when multiple restrictions interact, and ensuring constraints can be efficiently evaluated in real-time. Researchers are particularly focused on creating languages that can express both hard constraints (absolute boundaries that must never be violated) and soft constraints (preferences or guidelines that can be traded off against other objectives).

A central area of investigation is the development of constraint languages that can handle dynamic and context-dependent restrictions, where the precise boundaries of acceptable behavior may shift based on environmental conditions or system state. This includes work on adaptive constraints that can automatically adjust to changing circumstances while maintaining safety guarantees, and hierarchical constraint systems that can manage multiple levels of restrictions with different priorities and enforcement mechanisms.
