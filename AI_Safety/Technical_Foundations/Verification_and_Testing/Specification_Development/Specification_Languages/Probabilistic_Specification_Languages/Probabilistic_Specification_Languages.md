### Mini Description

Languages designed to express specifications under uncertainty, including probabilistic constraints, statistical properties, and expected behaviors across distributions.

### Description

Probabilistic specification languages provide formal frameworks for expressing requirements and properties of AI systems that operate under uncertainty. These languages extend traditional formal specifications to handle stochastic behaviors, partial observability, and statistical guarantees. They enable precise description of expected system behaviors across probability distributions, confidence levels for safety constraints, and acceptable ranges of uncertainty in decision-making processes.

Current research focuses on developing languages that can express both aleatory uncertainty (inherent randomness in the system) and epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty due to limited knowledge). Key challenges include specifying requirements for systems that learn and adapt over time, handling compound uncertainties in complex systems, and maintaining computational tractability for verification. Researchers are particularly interested in languages that can express safety properties that must hold with high probability while allowing flexibility in less critical aspects.

Emerging approaches combine classical probabilistic logics with modern machine learning concepts, enabling specifications that can handle distributional shift, out-of-distribution behavior, and uncertainty in human feedback. This includes work on probabilistic temporal logics, statistical specification patterns, and frameworks for expressing uncertainty in reward functions and constraints. A major focus is developing languages that remain meaningful and verifiable as AI systems become more capable and autonomous.
