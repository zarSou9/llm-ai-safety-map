### Mini Description

Languages focused on expressing human values, preferences, and ethical principles in formal terms that can guide AI system behavior.

### Description

Value Specification Languages focus on developing formal frameworks for expressing human values, ethical principles, and preferences in ways that can be operationalized within AI systems. These languages must bridge the fundamental gap between abstract human values and concrete computational specifications while maintaining sufficient expressiveness to capture nuanced moral considerations, context-dependent preferences, and complex value trade-offs.

A key challenge is handling the hierarchical and interconnected nature of human values, where high-level principles must be decomposed into more specific guidelines while preserving their intended meaning and relationships. Current research explores various approaches, from preference logic frameworks that can express relative value judgments to deontic logics that capture obligations and permissions. Researchers are particularly focused on developing languages that can handle value uncertainty, conflicting principles, and the context-sensitivity of moral judgments.

Emerging work in this area emphasizes the need for languages that can express both explicit rules and learned value patterns, supporting hybrid approaches to value alignment. This includes developing frameworks for specifying meta-preferences about how to resolve value conflicts, mechanisms for expressing uncertainty about value judgments, and methods for capturing the procedural aspects of moral reasoning. A central challenge remains ensuring that these languages can effectively bridge philosophical theories of ethics with practical implementation requirements.
