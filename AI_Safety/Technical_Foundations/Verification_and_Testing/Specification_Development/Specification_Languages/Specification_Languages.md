### Mini Description

Development of domain-specific languages and formal frameworks for expressing AI system requirements, including both deterministic and probabilistic specifications.

### Description

Specification languages for AI safety focus on developing formal notations and frameworks that can precisely express desired behaviors, constraints, and properties of AI systems. These languages must bridge the gap between human-interpretable requirements and machine-verifiable specifications while maintaining mathematical rigor and computational tractability. The challenge lies in creating languages expressive enough to capture complex safety requirements yet structured enough to enable automated verification and reasoning.

Current research explores various paradigms, from traditional formal methods languages adapted for AI contexts to novel domain-specific languages designed specifically for machine learning systems. These include temporal logics for specifying behavioral sequences, probabilistic specification languages for handling uncertainty, and constraint languages for defining safety boundaries. Researchers are particularly focused on developing compositional languages that allow complex specifications to be built from simpler components, enabling scalability and reuse.

A key area of development is the creation of specification languages that can handle the unique challenges of AI systems, such as emergent behaviors, distributional shift, and complex value learning tasks. This includes work on languages that can express both hard constraints and soft preferences, specify behavior under uncertainty, and capture subtle aspects of human values and intentions. The field is actively exploring trade-offs between expressiveness, verifiability, and usability, while developing tools and frameworks to support specification writing and validation.
