### Mini Description

Frameworks for expressing requirements in terms of probability distributions and statistical properties, including chance constraints and stochastic temporal logics.

### Description

Probabilistic Specification Models provide formal frameworks for expressing requirements about AI system behavior in terms of probability distributions and statistical properties. These models extend traditional logical specifications to handle uncertainty inherent in AI systems, allowing requirements to be expressed in terms of expected behaviors, confidence intervals, and probabilistic guarantees rather than absolute statements.

Current research focuses on developing specification languages that can capture complex temporal and causal relationships while maintaining tractable verification procedures. Key approaches include probabilistic temporal logics for expressing time-dependent properties, probabilistic safety properties that bound the likelihood of failure modes, and statistical specification patterns that describe desired distributional properties of system behavior. These frameworks must balance expressiveness with computational feasibility, often employing approximation techniques or restricted specification forms that enable efficient verification.

A central challenge is handling the interaction between different sources of uncertainty, including measurement noise, model uncertainty, and inherent system stochasticity. Researchers are developing compositional approaches that allow complex specifications to be built from simpler probabilistic components, methods for reasoning about rare events and tail probabilities, and techniques for specifying requirements about the learning process itself. Open questions include how to specify requirements about distribution shift, how to handle dependent probabilities in complex specifications, and how to verify probabilistic specifications in the presence of adversarial inputs.
