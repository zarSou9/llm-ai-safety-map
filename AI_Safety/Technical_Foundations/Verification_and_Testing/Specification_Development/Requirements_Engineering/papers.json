    "title": "How Mature is Requirements Engineering for AI-based Systems? A Systematic Mapping Study on Practices, Challenges, and Future Research Directions",
    "published_date": "2024-09-11",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) permeates all fields of life, which resulted in new challenges in requirements engineering for artificial intelligence (RE4AI), e.g., the difficulty in specifying and validating requirements for AI or considering new quality requirements due to emerging ethical implications. It is currently unclear if existing RE methods are sufficient or if new ones are needed to address these challenges. Therefore, our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of RE4AI to researchers and practitioners. What has been achieved so far, i.e., what practices are available, and what research gaps and challenges still need to be addressed? To achieve this, we conducted a systematic mapping study combining query string search and extensive snowballing. The extracted data was aggregated, and results were synthesized using thematic analysis. Our selection process led to the inclusion of 126 primary studies. Existing RE4AI research focuses mainly on requirements analysis and elicitation, with most practices applied in these areas. Furthermore, we identified requirements specification, explainability, and the gap between machine learning engineers and end-users as the most prevalent challenges, along with a few others. Additionally, we proposed seven potential research directions to address these challenges. Practitioners can use our results to identify and select suitable RE methods for working on their AI-based systems, while researchers can build on the identified gaps and research directions to push the field forward.",
    "summary": "This systematic mapping study analyzes existing requirements engineering practices for AI-based systems (RE4AI), revealing a focus on analysis and elicitation but highlighting challenges in specification, explainability, and communication between stakeholders. The study identifies key research gaps and proposes future research directions to improve RE4AI methodologies."

    "title": "Requirements Engineering for Artificial Intelligence Systems: A Systematic Mapping Study",
    "published_date": "2022-12-20",
    "abstract": "[Context] In traditional software systems, Requirements Engineering (RE) activities are well-established and researched. However, building Artificial Intelligence (AI) based software with limited or no insight into the system's inner workings poses significant new challenges to RE. Existing literature has focused on using AI to manage RE activities, with limited research on RE for AI (RE4AI). [Objective] This paper investigates current approaches for specifying requirements for AI systems, identifies available frameworks, methodologies, tools, and techniques used to model requirements, and finds existing challenges and limitations. [Method] We performed a systematic mapping study to find papers on current RE4AI approaches. We identified 43 primary studies and analysed the existing methodologies, models, tools, and techniques used to specify and model requirements in real-world scenarios. [Results] We found several challenges and limitations of existing RE4AI practices. The findings highlighted that current RE applications were not adequately adaptable for building AI systems and emphasised the need to provide new techniques and tools to support RE4AI. [Conclusion] Our results showed that most of the empirical studies on RE4AI focused on autonomous, self-driving vehicles and managing data requirements, and areas such as ethics, trust, and explainability need further research.",

    "title": "Generative AI for Requirements Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review",
    "published_date": "2024-09-10",
    "abstract": "Context: Requirements engineering (RE) faces mounting challenges in handling increasingly complex software systems. The emergence of generative AI (GenAI) offers new opportunities and challenges in RE. Objective: This systematic literature review aims to analyze and synthesize current research on GenAI applications in RE, focusing on identifying research trends, methodologies, challenges, and future directions. Method: We conducted a comprehensive review of 105 articles published between 2019 and 2024 obtained from major academic databases, using a systematic methodology for paper selection, data extraction, and feature analysis. Results: Analysis revealed the following. (1) While GPT series models dominate current applications by 67.3% of studies, the existing architectures face technical challenges-interpretability (61.9%), reproducibility (52.4%), and controllability (47.6%), which demonstrate strong correlations (>35% co-occurrence). (2) Reproducibility is identified as a major concern by 52.4% of studies, which highlights challenges in achieving consistent results due to the stochastic nature and parameter sensitivity of GenAI. (3) Governance-related issues (e.g., ethics and security) form a distinct cluster of challenges that requires coordinated solutions, yet they are addressed by less than 20% of studies. Conclusions: While GenAI exhibits potential in RE, our findings reveal critical issues: (1) the high correlations among interpretability, reproducibility, and controllability imply the requirement for more specialized architectures that target interdependencies of these attributes. (2) The widespread concern about result consistency and reproducibility demands standardized evaluation frameworks. (3) The emergence of challenges related to interconnected governance demands comprehensive governance structures.",
    "summary": "This systematic literature review of 105 papers analyzes generative AI's application in requirements engineering, revealing significant challenges in interpretability, reproducibility, and controllability of current models, alongside a need for improved governance structures addressing ethical and security concerns. The study highlights the need for specialized architectures and standardized evaluation frameworks to address these limitations."

    "title": "Requirements Elicitation and Modelling of Artificial Intelligence Systems: An Empirical Study",
    "published_date": "2023-02-13",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have gained significant traction in the recent past, creating new challenges in requirements engineering (RE) when building AI software systems. RE for AI practices have not been studied much and have scarce empirical studies. Additionally, many AI software solutions tend to focus on the technical aspects and ignore human-centered values. In this paper, we report on a case study for eliciting and modeling requirements using our framework and a supporting tool for human-centred RE for AI systems. Our case study is a mobile health application for encouraging type-2 diabetic people to reduce their sedentary behavior. We conducted our study with three experts from the app team -- a software engineer, a project manager and a data scientist. We found in our study that most human-centered aspects were not originally considered when developing the first version of the application. We also report on other insights and challenges faced in RE for the health application, e.g., frequently changing requirements.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a case study using a novel framework to elicit and model requirements for a human-centered AI system, revealing a lack of initial consideration for human-centered aspects in the development of a mobile health application for type-2 diabetics and highlighting challenges like frequently changing requirements."

    "title": "Requirements Practices and Gaps When Engineering Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Systems",
    "published_date": "2023-01-25",
    "abstract": "[Context] Engineering Artificial Intelligence (AI) software is a relatively new area with many challenges, unknowns, and limited proven best practices. Big companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple have provided a suite of recent guidelines to assist engineering teams in building human-centered AI systems. [Objective] The practices currently adopted by practitioners for developing such systems, especially during Requirements Engineering (RE), are little studied and reported to date. [Method] This paper presents the results of a survey conducted to understand current industry practices in RE for AI (RE4AI) and to determine which key human-centered AI guidelines should be followed. Our survey is based on mapping existing industrial guidelines, best practices, and efforts in the literature. [Results] We surveyed 29 professionals and found most participants agreed that all the human-centered aspects we mapped should be addressed in RE. Further, we found that most participants were using UML or Microsoft Office to present requirements. [Conclusion] We identify that most of the tools currently used are not equipped to manage AI-based software, and the use of UML and Office may pose issues to the quality of requirements captured for AI. Also, all human-centered practices mapped from the guidelines should be included in RE.",

    "summary": "A survey of 29 AI professionals revealed widespread agreement on the importance of incorporating human-centered design principles into requirements engineering for AI systems, yet current practices, primarily using UML and Microsoft Office, are inadequate for managing the unique challenges of AI software development."

    "title": "Requirements Engineering in Machine Learning Projects",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, machine learning methods have revolutionized a large number of domains and provided solutions to many problems that people could hardly solve in the past. The availability of large amounts of data, powerful processing architectures, and easy-to-use software frameworks have made machine learning a popular, readily available, and affordable option in many different domains and contexts. However, the development and maintenance of production-level machine learning systems have proven to be quite challenging, as these activities require an engineering approach and solid best practices. Software engineering offers a mature development process and best practices for conventional software systems, but some of them are not directly applicable to the new programming paradigm imposed by machine learning. The same applies to the requirements engineering best practices. Therefore, this article provides an overview of the requirements engineering challenges in the development of machine learning systems that have been reported in the research literature, along with their proposed solutions. Furthermore, it presents our approach to overcoming those challenges in the form of a case study. Through this mixed-method study, the article tries to identify the necessary adjustments to (1) the best practices for conventional requirements engineering and (2) the conventional understanding of certain types of requirements to better fit the specifics of machine learning. Moreover, the article tries to emphasize the relevance of properly conducted requirements engineering activities in addressing the complexity of machine learning systems, as well as to motivate further discussion on the requirements engineering best practices in developing such systems.",
