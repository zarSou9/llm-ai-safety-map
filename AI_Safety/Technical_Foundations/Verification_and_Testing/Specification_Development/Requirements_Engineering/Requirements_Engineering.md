### Mini Description

Processes and methodologies for eliciting, analyzing, and documenting AI system requirements from stakeholders and translating them into formal specifications.

### Description

Requirements Engineering in AI safety focuses on systematically gathering, analyzing, and documenting the complex requirements that safe AI systems must satisfy. This process involves extensive interaction with diverse stakeholders - including ethicists, domain experts, end-users, and policymakers - to capture both explicit functional requirements and implicit safety constraints. The challenge lies in eliciting requirements that may be difficult to articulate, especially when dealing with abstract concepts like value alignment or long-term safety considerations.

A key aspect is the development of methodologies for decomposing high-level safety goals into concrete, implementable requirements while maintaining traceability and managing conflicts between different stakeholders' needs. This includes techniques for identifying potential failure modes, analyzing edge cases, and ensuring completeness in requirement coverage. Researchers are particularly focused on methods for handling requirements that emerge from complex system behaviors and interactions that may not be apparent at design time.

Current research challenges include developing frameworks for requirements evolution as AI capabilities advance, managing uncertainty in requirement specification, and creating methods for validating requirements before implementation. There's particular emphasis on ensuring requirements are robust against specification gaming and can effectively capture safety-critical constraints while remaining flexible enough to accommodate beneficial AI behavior.
