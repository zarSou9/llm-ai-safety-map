### Mini Description

Methods and frameworks for effectively engaging with diverse stakeholders to elicit, prioritize, and reconcile different safety requirements and constraints.

### Description

Stakeholder Engagement in AI safety requirements engineering focuses on systematically involving and incorporating input from diverse parties affected by or involved in AI system development and deployment. This includes direct stakeholders like developers, users, and domain experts, as well as indirect stakeholders such as affected communities, ethicists, policy makers, and future generations. The challenge lies in creating structured processes that can effectively capture, synthesize, and prioritize varied perspectives while accounting for power dynamics, cognitive biases, and differing levels of technical expertise.

Current research emphasizes developing frameworks for identifying relevant stakeholders, particularly those who might be inadvertently excluded or underrepresented in traditional requirement gathering processes. This includes methods for surfacing implicit assumptions, understanding complex value trade-offs, and ensuring that safety requirements reflect diverse cultural and ethical perspectives. Researchers are exploring techniques from participatory design, value-sensitive design, and democratic deliberation to create more inclusive and effective engagement processes.

Key challenges include managing stakeholder conflicts, handling uncertainty about future impacts, and translating qualitative stakeholder input into formal requirements. There's particular focus on developing methods for engaging stakeholders around abstract or technical concepts, ensuring meaningful participation rather than superficial consultation, and creating feedback mechanisms that allow requirements to evolve based on stakeholder learning and changing contexts. This includes research on novel facilitation techniques, deliberative methods, and tools for collaborative requirement specification.
