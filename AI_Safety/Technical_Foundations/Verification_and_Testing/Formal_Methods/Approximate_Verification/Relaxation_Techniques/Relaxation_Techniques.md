### Mini Description

Methods that simplify verification problems through mathematical relaxations, including linear programming relaxations and semidefinite programming approaches.

### Description

Relaxation techniques in AI verification involve transforming complex, non-convex verification problems into more tractable forms by replacing difficult constraints with looser but mathematically simpler approximations. These methods typically convert neural network verification tasks into optimization problems that can be solved efficiently using established mathematical programming techniques, trading some precision for computational feasibility.

Current approaches focus on developing tighter relaxations that maintain computational efficiency while minimizing the gap between the relaxed and original problems. Key techniques include linear programming relaxations that approximate activation functions with linear constraints, convex relaxations that bound non-convex functions with convex envelopes, and specialized relaxations for specific neural network architectures. Researchers are particularly interested in adaptive relaxation schemes that can automatically adjust their tightness based on the verification context.

Major challenges include developing relaxations that scale effectively to deep networks while maintaining meaningful bounds, handling complex activation functions and architectural features, and quantifying the impact of relaxation choices on verification results. Active research directions explore hierarchical relaxation schemes, techniques for incrementally tightening relaxations, and methods for combining multiple relaxation approaches to achieve better precision-performance trade-offs.
