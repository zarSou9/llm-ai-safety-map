### Mini Description

Approaches using sampling and statistical inference to provide probabilistic verification results, including scenario optimization and statistical model checking.

### Description

Statistical Guarantees in AI verification leverage probabilistic methods and sampling techniques to provide quantifiable confidence bounds on system properties when deterministic verification is intractable. These approaches draw from statistical learning theory, extreme value theory, and concentration inequalities to establish probabilistic safety certificates that hold with high confidence. The key challenge lies in determining appropriate sample sizes and sampling strategies that provide meaningful guarantees while remaining computationally feasible.

Current research focuses on developing more efficient sampling methods that can handle high-dimensional input spaces and complex failure modes. This includes importance sampling techniques to focus on rare events, adaptive sampling strategies that intelligently explore the input space, and methods for handling distributional shift. Researchers are also working on techniques to combine multiple sources of evidence, including both empirical data and analytical bounds, to strengthen statistical guarantees.

A central area of investigation is the development of rigorous frameworks for quantifying uncertainty in verification results, particularly for safety-critical properties. This includes methods for handling both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness in the system) and epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty due to limited sampling). Open challenges include developing tighter bounds that remain valid under distribution shift, handling temporal dependencies in sequential decision-making systems, and providing meaningful guarantees for complex emergent behaviors.
