### Mini Description

Specialized formal languages designed for expressing properties unique to AI systems, such as robustness specifications, fairness constraints, and alignment requirements.

### Description

Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for AI safety focus on creating specialized formal languages that precisely capture properties and constraints unique to AI systems. These languages are designed to express concepts like neural network architecture constraints, learning bounds, robustness requirements, and complex behavioral specifications in ways that are both human-readable and amenable to automated verification. Unlike general-purpose specification languages, they incorporate AI-specific primitives and semantics that directly map to relevant mathematical frameworks.

A key challenge in DSL design is balancing expressiveness with tractability. Languages must be powerful enough to capture subtle safety requirements while remaining computationally feasible for verification. Current research explores modular language designs that separate concerns like architectural constraints, behavioral specifications, and runtime monitoring requirements. This includes developing specialized sublanguages for different aspects of AI systems, such as input-output relationships, training dynamics, and deployment constraints.

Emerging areas of research include DSLs for specifying uncertainty bounds and confidence levels in AI predictions, languages for describing distribution shift and out-of-distribution behavior, and frameworks for specifying complex value-alignment properties. Researchers are also developing tools for DSL compilation, including translation to verification conditions, test generation from specifications, and runtime monitoring code synthesis. A particular focus is on creating languages that can express emergent properties and higher-order effects that may arise in more capable systems.
