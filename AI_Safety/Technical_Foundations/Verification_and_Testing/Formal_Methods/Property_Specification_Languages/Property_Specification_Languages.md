### Mini Description

Formal languages and logics for precisely expressing desired properties and constraints of AI systems, including temporal logics, specification patterns, and domain-specific languages.

### Description

Property Specification Languages in AI safety focus on formal frameworks for precisely expressing desired behaviors, constraints, and properties of AI systems. These languages bridge the gap between informal requirements and mathematical verification, providing unambiguous ways to specify both safety properties (what systems should never do) and liveness properties (what systems should eventually accomplish). The challenge lies in developing expressive yet tractable languages that can capture complex behavioral requirements while remaining amenable to automated verification.

Current research explores various formal frameworks, from traditional temporal logics adapted for AI-specific needs to novel domain-specific languages designed for neural networks and learning systems. These languages must handle unique challenges in AI specification, including probabilistic behaviors, learning dynamics, and emergent properties. Particularly challenging is specifying properties about distribution shift, out-of-distribution behavior, and complex value-laden concepts like fairness or alignment.

A key area of development is the creation of compositional specification languages that allow complex properties to be built from simpler ones, enabling scalable verification of large systems. Researchers are also working on bridging the semantic gap between human-interpretable specifications and machine-verifiable properties, including methods for automatically translating natural language requirements into formal specifications and techniques for validating that specifications actually capture intended properties.
