### Description

Interactive Proof Assistants in AI safety combine automated reasoning capabilities with human guidance to verify properties of AI systems. These tools provide formal frameworks where researchers can construct rigorous mathematical proofs while receiving automated support for routine reasoning steps, management of proof obligations, and verification of proof correctness. They are particularly valuable for complex verification tasks where fully automated approaches are intractable but human insight can guide the proof process.

Modern proof assistants for AI verification typically include specialized tactics and libraries for handling neural network architectures, machine learning concepts, and common verification patterns. Key challenges include developing intuitive interfaces that bridge the gap between machine learning practitioners and formal methods, creating efficient proof automation for neural network-specific reasoning, and managing the complexity of large-scale proofs about AI systems.

Current research focuses on improving the usability of proof assistants through better error messages, proof state visualization, and suggestion systems that can recommend proof strategies. There is also significant work on developing domain-specific languages and intermediate representations that make AI systems more amenable to interactive verification, as well as methods for translating between different formal frameworks while preserving proof validity. A key open challenge is scaling interactive verification to handle the increasing complexity of modern AI systems while maintaining tractable proof development time.
