### Mini Description

Methods for exactly computing the set of possible outputs for a given input region, including polytope propagation and exact interval arithmetic.

### Description

Reachability Analysis in AI safety focuses on precisely computing and characterizing the set of all possible outputs that a neural network can produce given a specified input region. This involves tracking how input uncertainties propagate through the network's layers while accounting for the effects of non-linear activations, weight matrices, and architectural components. The goal is to determine exact bounds on network behavior, which is crucial for verifying safety properties and understanding system limitations.

Current approaches typically employ geometric methods to represent and propagate sets of activations through the network. These include exact polytope propagation, zonotope-based methods, and star-set representations. A key challenge is managing the computational complexity of exact representations, as the number of vertices in reachable sets can grow exponentially with network depth. This has led to the development of hybrid approaches that maintain exactness where crucial while using strategic approximations to manage complexity.

Recent research has focused on developing more efficient representations and propagation algorithms, particularly for handling different neural network architectures and activation functions. Open challenges include scaling to larger networks while maintaining exactness, handling recurrent and attention-based architectures, and developing methods that can provide useful information about network behavior even when exact computation becomes intractable. There is also growing interest in combining reachability analysis with other verification approaches to leverage their complementary strengths.
