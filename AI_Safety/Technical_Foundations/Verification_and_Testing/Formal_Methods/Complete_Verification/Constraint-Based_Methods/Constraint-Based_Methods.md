### Mini Description

Techniques that transform neural network verification into constraint satisfaction problems, including SMT solving and mixed-integer programming approaches.

### Description

Constraint-based methods in AI verification transform neural network properties into constraint satisfaction problems that can be solved using established tools and techniques. These approaches typically encode network architecture, weights, and activation functions as mathematical constraints, along with the properties to be verified, creating a system that can be analyzed using SAT/SMT solvers or other constraint solving techniques.

A key challenge in constraint-based verification is developing efficient encodings that capture the non-linear nature of neural networks while remaining tractable for solvers. Current research explores various relaxation techniques, clever constraint formulations, and specialized solving strategies. This includes methods for handling ReLU activations through mixed-integer formulations, techniques for encoding other activation functions, and approaches for managing the exponential growth in constraint systems for deeper networks.

Active areas of investigation include developing more efficient encoding schemes for specific network architectures, creating specialized constraint solvers optimized for neural network verification, and exploring hybrid approaches that combine constraint-based methods with other verification techniques. Researchers are particularly focused on improving scalability while maintaining completeness guarantees, as well as extending these methods to verify more complex properties beyond simple input-output relationships.
