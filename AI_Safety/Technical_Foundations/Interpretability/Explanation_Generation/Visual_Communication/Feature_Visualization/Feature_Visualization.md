### Mini Description

Techniques for visualizing the features and patterns that AI systems detect and use, including activation maximization, attribution maps, and neuron visualization.

### Description

Feature visualization encompasses techniques for understanding and visualizing the patterns, features, and representations that neural networks learn and utilize in their processing. These methods aim to make the abstract, high-dimensional representations within AI systems concrete and interpretable by generating or identifying input patterns that maximally activate specific neurons, channels, or layers. This includes both synthetic visualization approaches that generate idealized inputs and attribution methods that highlight important features in real inputs.

A central challenge in feature visualization is the optimization process itself - generating meaningful visualizations often requires careful regularization and constraints to avoid adversarial or uninterpretable patterns. Researchers must balance between clarity and authenticity, ensuring visualizations are both human-interpretable and faithful to the model's actual processing. This has led to the development of various optimization objectives and regularization techniques, from frequency penalization to transformation robustness.

Current research focuses on scaling feature visualization to larger models and more complex architectures, particularly in understanding emergent features in large language models and multi-modal systems. Key open questions include how to visualize higher-level semantic concepts, how to validate that visualizations accurately represent model behavior, and how to connect local feature visualizations to global model understanding. The field is also exploring ways to use feature visualization as a diagnostic tool for model development and debugging.
