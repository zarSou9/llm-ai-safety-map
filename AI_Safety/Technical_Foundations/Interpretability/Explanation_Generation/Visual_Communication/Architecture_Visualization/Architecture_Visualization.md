### Mini Description

Methods for representing the structure and information flow within AI systems, including network diagrams, computational graphs, and layer-wise visualizations.

### Description

Architecture Visualization in AI systems focuses on creating visual representations of neural network structures, computational pathways, and information flow patterns. These visualizations help researchers and practitioners understand the organization, connectivity, and operational principles of AI models, ranging from simple feed-forward networks to complex transformer architectures. The field draws from graph theory, information design, and human-computer interaction to develop effective ways of representing complex architectural relationships.

A central challenge is managing visual complexity while maintaining meaningful representation. As models grow to billions of parameters and incorporate sophisticated interaction patterns, traditional node-link diagrams become inadequate. This has led to the development of hierarchical visualization approaches, abstract representations of computational blocks, and interactive systems that allow users to navigate different levels of architectural detail. Researchers must balance the trade-off between showing complete structural information and providing intuitive, actionable insights.

Current research explores novel visualization paradigms for emerging architectural patterns, such as attention mechanisms, skip connections, and multi-modal interfaces. This includes developing standardized visual languages for representing common architectural components, creating interactive tools for architecture design and debugging, and investigating ways to visualize dynamic architectural changes in adaptive or growing networks. The field increasingly focuses on visualizing not just static structure but also the dynamic aspects of architecture, such as gradient flow and activation patterns during training.
