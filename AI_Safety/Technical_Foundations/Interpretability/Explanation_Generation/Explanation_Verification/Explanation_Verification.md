### Mini Description

Methods for evaluating the accuracy and faithfulness of generated explanations, including both automated metrics and human evaluation approaches.

### Description

Explanation Verification addresses the critical challenge of ensuring that AI-generated explanations accurately reflect the true decision-making process of the underlying model. This involves developing rigorous methods to evaluate both the completeness and faithfulness of explanations, where completeness measures whether all relevant factors are included, and faithfulness assesses whether the explanation matches the actual computational process used by the model.

Current approaches combine formal verification techniques with empirical evaluation methods. Formal approaches attempt to prove properties about the relationship between model computation and generated explanations, while empirical methods use carefully designed experiments to test explanation quality. These include counterfactual testing, where explanations are evaluated against known model behaviors under controlled input modifications, and comparative analysis between different explanation methods.

A key challenge is the inherent difficulty in establishing ground truth for explanations, particularly in complex models where the true decision-making process may be distributed across millions of parameters. Researchers are developing new metrics and evaluation frameworks that can handle this uncertainty, including methods that incorporate human feedback while accounting for cognitive biases and limitations in human understanding of machine learning systems.
