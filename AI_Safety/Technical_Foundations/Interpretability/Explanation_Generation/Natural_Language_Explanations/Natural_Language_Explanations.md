### Mini Description

Methods for generating human-readable textual explanations of model decisions, including reasoning chains, counterfactuals, and simplified decision rules.

### Description

Natural Language Explanations in AI systems focus on generating human-readable textual descriptions that elucidate model decisions, reasoning processes, and behavioral patterns. These explanations must bridge the gap between complex mathematical operations and human understanding while maintaining accuracy and faithfulness to the underlying model's decision-making process. The field draws heavily from linguistics, cognitive science, and natural language processing to develop methods that can articulate model behavior in ways that humans find intuitive and informative.

A central challenge is maintaining the balance between completeness and comprehensibility. Explanations must capture relevant technical details while avoiding overwhelming complexity, often requiring careful abstraction and summarization. This has led to diverse approaches, from generating step-by-step reasoning chains that mirror human problem-solving to producing counterfactual explanations that highlight critical decision factors. Researchers must also address the challenge of explanation verification, ensuring generated explanations accurately reflect the model's true decision-making process rather than post-hoc rationalizations.

Current research increasingly focuses on handling emerging capabilities in large language models, including their ability to generate self-reflective explanations and meta-cognitive commentary. This raises new questions about the relationship between model-generated explanations and actual model behavior, particularly when models can generate plausible but potentially misleading explanations. The field is also exploring methods for generating explanations that can account for uncertainty, limitations, and potential failure modes, helping users develop appropriate levels of trust and understanding.
