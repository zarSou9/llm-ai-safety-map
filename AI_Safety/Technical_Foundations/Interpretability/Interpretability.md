### Mini Description

Techniques and theories for understanding AI system behavior and decision-making processes, including both mechanistic and functional approaches.

### Description

AI Interpretability focuses on developing methods and frameworks to understand how AI systems process information and make decisions. This encompasses both analyzing the internal mechanisms of neural networks and characterizing their high-level behavioral patterns. The field has become increasingly critical as AI systems grow more complex and are deployed in high-stakes applications where understanding their decision-making process is crucial for safety and trust.

Current research approaches range from studying individual neurons and circuits to analyzing emergent behaviors and capabilities. Low-level interpretability work focuses on understanding the role of specific network components and how information flows through the system. High-level approaches aim to characterize model behavior through techniques like activation visualization, feature attribution, and behavioral testing. Both approaches complement each other in building a comprehensive understanding of AI systems.

Key challenges include scaling interpretability methods to larger models, developing techniques that work across different architectures, and bridging the gap between local explanations and global understanding. The field also grapples with fundamental questions about what constitutes a satisfactory explanation and how to verify that our interpretations accurately reflect the system's true decision-making process. As models become more capable, interpretability research increasingly focuses on understanding higher-level cognitive processes and emergent capabilities.
