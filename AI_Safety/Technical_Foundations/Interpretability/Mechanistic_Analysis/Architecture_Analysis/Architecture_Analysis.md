### Mini Description

Study of how structural elements of the network architecture influence the formation and operation of computational mechanisms.

### Description

Architecture Analysis in mechanistic interpretability examines how the structural design choices and components of neural networks influence the formation and operation of computational mechanisms. This includes studying how different architectural elements like attention mechanisms, skip connections, and layer configurations affect the network's ability to learn and implement specific computational patterns. The research aims to understand which architectural features enable or inhibit the emergence of interpretable circuits and mechanisms.

Current approaches combine theoretical analysis of architecture properties with empirical studies of how different designs impact model behavior and interpretability. Researchers investigate questions such as how architecture choices affect feature representation, information bottlenecks, and the formation of specialized computational circuits. This includes studying both the local effects of specific architectural components and their global impact on network behavior and capabilities.

Key challenges include identifying which architectural features promote the development of interpretable mechanisms, understanding the trade-offs between different design choices, and developing principles for architecting more transparent and analyzable systems. The field also explores how architecture influences the scaling properties of mechanistic interpretability techniques and how different structural choices affect our ability to perform meaningful analysis as models grow in size and complexity.
