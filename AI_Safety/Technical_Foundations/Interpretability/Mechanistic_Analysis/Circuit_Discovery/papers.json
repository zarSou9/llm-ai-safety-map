    "title": "Connectome-constrained deep mechanistic networks predict neural responses across the fly visual system at single-neuron resolution",
    "abstract": "We can now measure the connectivity of every neuron in a neural circuit, but we are still blind to other biological details, including the dynamical characteristics of each neuron. The degree to which connectivity measurements alone can inform understanding of neural computation is an open question. Here we show that with only measurements of the connectivity of a biological neural network, we can predict the neural activity underlying neural computation. We constructed a model neural network with the experimentally determined connectivity for 64 cell types in the motion pathways of the fruit fly optic lobe but with unknown parameters for the single neuron and single synapse properties. We then optimized the values of these unknown parameters using techniques from deep learning, to allow the model network to detect visual motion. Our mechanistic model makes detailed experimentally testable predictions for each neuron in the connectome. We found that model predictions agreed with experimental measurements of neural activity across 24 studies. Our work demonstrates a strategy for generating detailed hypotheses about the mechanisms of neural circuit function from connectivity measurements. We show that this strategy is more likely to be successful when neurons are sparsely connected‚Äîa universally observed feature of biological neural networks across species and brain regions.",

    "title": "Organization of an Ascending Circuit that Conveys Flight Motor State",
    "abstract": "Natural behaviors are a coordinated symphony of motor acts which drive self-induced or reafferent sensory activation. Single sensors only signal presence and magnitude of a sensory cue; they cannot disambiguate exafferent (externally-induced) from reafferent sources. Nevertheless, animals readily differentiate between these sources of sensory signals to make appropriate decisions and initiate adaptive behavioral outcomes. This is mediated by predictive motor signaling mechanisms, which emanate from motor control pathways to sensory processing pathways, but how predictive motor signaling circuits function at the cellular and synaptic level is poorly understood. We use a variety of techniques, including connectomics from both male and female electron microscopy volumes, transcriptomics, neuroanatomical, physiological and behavioral approaches to resolve the network architecture of two pairs of ascending histaminergic neurons (AHNs), which putatively provide predictive motor signals to several sensory and motor neuropil. Both AHN pairs receive input primarily from an overlapping population of descending neurons, many of which drive wing motor output. The two AHN pairs target almost exclusively non-overlapping downstream neural networks including those that process visual, auditory and mechanosensory information as well as networks coordinating wing, haltere, and leg motor output. These results support the conclusion that the AHN pairs multi-task, integrating a large amount of common input, then tile their output in the brain, providing predictive motor signals to non-overlapping sensory networks affecting motor control both directly and indirectly.",

This \"multi-tasking\" architecture allows for the differentiation of self-induced versus external sensory stimuli."

    "title": "Hierarchical Modular Structure of the Drosophila Connectome",
    "abstract": "The structure of neural circuitry plays a crucial role in brain function. Previous studies of brain organization generally had to trade off between coarse descriptions at a large scale and fine descriptions on a small scale. Researchers have now reconstructed tens to hundreds of thousands of neurons at synaptic resolution, enabling investigations into the interplay between global, modular organization, and cell type-specific wiring. Analyzing data of this scale, however, presents unique challenges. To address this problem, we applied novel community detection methods to analyze the synapse-level reconstruction of an adult female Drosophila melanogaster brain containing >20,000 neurons and 10 million synapses. Using a machine-learning algorithm, we find the most densely connected communities of neurons by maximizing a generalized modularity density measure. We resolve the community structure at a range of scales, from large (on the order of thousands of neurons) to small (on the order of tens of neurons). We find that the network is organized hierarchically, and larger-scale communities are composed of smaller-scale structures. Our methods identify well-known features of the fly brain, including its sensory pathways. Moreover, focusing on specific brain regions, we are able to identify subnetworks with distinct connectivity types. For example, manual efforts have identified layered structures in the fan-shaped body. Our methods not only automatically recover this layered structure, but also resolve finer connectivity patterns to downstream and upstream areas. We also find a novel modular organization of the superior neuropil, with distinct clusters of upstream and downstream brain regions dividing the neuropil into several pathways. These methods show that the fine-scale, local network reconstruction made possible by modern experimental methods are sufficiently detailed to identify the organization of the brain across scales, and enable novel predictions about the structure and function of its parts. Significance Statement The Hemibrain is a partial connectome of an adult female Drosophila melanogaster brain containing >20,000 neurons and 10 million synapses. Analyzing the structure of a network of this size requires novel and efficient computational tools. We applied a new community detection method to automatically uncover the modular structure in the Hemibrain dataset by maximizing a generalized modularity measure. This allowed us to resolve the community structure of the fly hemibrain at a range of spatial scales revealing a hierarchical organization of the network, where larger-scale modules are composed of smaller-scale structures. The method also allowed us to identify subnetworks with distinct cell and connectivity structures, such as the layered structures in the fan-shaped body, and the modular organization of the superior neuropil. Thus, network analysis methods can be adopted to the connectomes being reconstructed using modern experimental methods to reveal the organization of the brain across scales. This supports the view that such connectomes will allow us to uncover the organizational structure of the brain, which can ultimately lead to a better understanding of its function.",

    "title": "Single circuit in V1 capable of switching contexts during movement using VIP population as a switch",
    "abstract": "As animals adapt to their environments, their brains are tasked with processing stimuli in different sensory contexts. Whether these computations are context dependent or independent, they are all implemented in the same neural tissue. A crucial question is what neural architectures can respond flexibly to a range of stimulus conditions and switch between them. This is a particular case of flexible architecture that permits multiple related computations within a single circuit. Here, we address this question in the specific case of the visual system circuitry, focusing on context integration, defined as the integration of feedforward and surround information across visual space. We show that a biologically inspired microcircuit with multiple inhibitory cell types can switch between visual processing of the static context and the moving context. In our model, the VIP population acts as the switch and modulates the visual circuit through a disinhibitory motif. Moreover, the VIP population is efficient, requiring only a relatively small number of neurons to switch contexts. This circuit eliminates noise in videos by using appropriate lateral connections for contextual spatio-temporal surround modulation, having superior denoising performance compared to circuits where only one context is learned. Our findings shed light on a minimally complex architecture that is capable of switching between two naturalistic contexts using few switching units. Author Summary The brain processes information at all times and much of that information is context-dependent. The visual system presents an important example: processing is ongoing, but the context changes dramatically when an animal is still vs. running. How is context-dependent information processing achieved? We take inspiration from recent neurophysiology studies on the role of distinct cell types in primary visual cortex (V1).We find that relatively few ‚Äúswitching units‚Äù ‚Äî akin to the VIP neuron type in V1 in that they turn on and off in the running vs. still context and have connections to and from the main population ‚Äî is sufficient to drive context dependent image processing. We demonstrate this in a model of feature integration, and in a test of image denoising. The underlying circuit architecture illustrates a concrete computational role for the multiple cell types under increasing study across the brain, and may inspire more flexible neurally inspired computing architectures.",

    "title": "Autoencoder networks extract latent variables and encode these variables in their connectomes",
    "abstract": "Spectacular advances in imaging and data processing techniques are revealing a wealth of information about brain connectomes. This raises an exciting scientific opportunity: to infer the underlying circuit function from the structure of its connectivity. A potential roadblock, however, is that ‚Äì even with well constrained neural dynamics ‚Äì there are in principle many different connectomes that could support a given computation. Here, we define a tractable setting in which the problem of inferring circuit function from circuit connectivity can be analyzed in detail: the function of input compression and reconstruction, in an autoencoder network with a single hidden layer. Here, in general there is substantial ambiguity in the weights that can produce the same circuit function, because largely arbitrary changes to ‚Äúinput‚Äù weights can be undone by applying the inverse modifications to the ‚Äúoutput‚Äù weights. However, we use mathematical arguments and simulations to show that adding simple, biologically motivated regularization of connectivity resolves this ambiguity in an interesting way: weights are constrained such that the latent variable structure underlying the inputs can be extracted from the weights by using nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods.",
