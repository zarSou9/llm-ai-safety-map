### Mini Description

Methods for measuring how accurately an interpretation represents the true behavior of the underlying model, including local and global fidelity measures.

### Description

Fidelity metrics in AI interpretability focus on quantifying how accurately an interpretation or explanation reflects the true decision-making process of the underlying model. These metrics aim to measure the degree to which an interpretation captures both the local behavior (decisions for specific inputs) and global behavior (overall decision patterns) of the AI system. The fundamental challenge lies in establishing ground truth, as the very complexity that necessitates interpretation also makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of explanations.

Current approaches broadly fall into two categories: model-based verification, where interpretations are evaluated against the model's actual computations and outputs, and empirical validation, where interpretations are tested through systematic perturbation studies and counterfactual analysis. Researchers have developed various mathematical frameworks for quantifying fidelity, including measures based on prediction agreement, feature importance correlation, and decision boundary alignment. These metrics must balance the trade-off between capturing subtle model behaviors and remaining computationally tractable.

A key area of ongoing research is the development of fidelity metrics that can scale to large language models and multi-modal systems, where traditional approaches may break down. This includes work on measuring fidelity across different levels of abstraction, from low-level activation patterns to high-level semantic concepts. The field also grapples with questions about how to validate fidelity metrics themselves and establish their reliability across different model architectures and domains.
