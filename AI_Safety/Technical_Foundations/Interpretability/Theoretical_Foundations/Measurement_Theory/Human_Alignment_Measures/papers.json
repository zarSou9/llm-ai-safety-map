    "title": "Connecting Concept Convexity and Human-Machine Alignment in Deep Neural Networks",
    "published_date": "2024-09-10",
    "abstract": "Understanding how neural networks align with human cognitive processes is a crucial step toward developing more interpretable and reliable AI systems. Motivated by theories of human cognition, this study examines the relationship between \\emph{convexity} in neural network representations and \\emph{human-machine alignment} based on behavioral data. We identify a correlation between these two dimensions in pretrained and fine-tuned vision transformer models. Our findings suggest that the convex regions formed in latent spaces of neural networks to some extent align with human-defined categories and reflect the similarity relations humans use in cognitive tasks. While optimizing for alignment generally enhances convexity, increasing convexity through fine-tuning yields inconsistent effects on alignment, which suggests a complex relationship between the two. This study presents a first step toward understanding the relationship between the convexity of latent representations and human-machine alignment."

    "title": "Aligning Machine and Human Visual Representations across Abstraction Levels",
    "published_date": "2024-09-10",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved success across a wide range of applications, including as models of human behavior in vision tasks. However, neural network training and human learning differ in fundamental ways, and neural networks often fail to generalize as robustly as humans do, raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. What is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-like behavior? We highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions, model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgments, then transfer human-like structure from its representations into pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behavior and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a new dataset of human judgments spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognition and more practically useful, thus paving the way toward more robust, interpretable, and human-like artificial intelligence systems.",

    "title": "Measuring Error Alignment for Decision-Making Systems",
    "published_date": "2024-09-20",
    "abstract": "Given that AI systems are set to play a pivotal role in future decision-making processes, their trustworthiness and reliability are of critical concern. Due to their scale and complexity, modern AI systems resist direct interpretation, and alternative ways are needed to establish trust in those systems, and determine how well they align with human values. We argue that good measures of the information processing similarities between AI and humans, may be able to achieve these same ends. While Representational alignment (RA) approaches measure similarity between the internal states of two systems, the associated data can be expensive and difficult to collect for human systems. In contrast, Behavioural alignment (BA) comparisons are cheaper and easier, but questions remain as to their sensitivity and reliability. We propose two new behavioural alignment metrics misclassification agreement which measures the similarity between the errors of two systems on the same instances, and class-level error similarity which measures the similarity between the error distributions of two systems. We show that our metrics correlate well with RA metrics, and provide complementary information to another BA metric, within a range of domains, and set the scene for a new approach to value alignment."

    "title": "Aligning Generalisation Between Humans and Machines",
    "published_date": "2024-11-23",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI -- including generative approaches -- have resulted in technology that can support humans in scientific discovery and decision support but may also disrupt democracies and target individuals. The responsible use of AI increasingly shows the need for human-AI teaming, necessitating effective interaction between humans and machines. A crucial yet often overlooked aspect of these interactions is the different ways in which humans and machines generalise. In cognitive science, human generalisation commonly involves abstraction and concept learning. In contrast, AI generalisation encompasses out-of-domain generalisation in machine learning, rule-based reasoning in symbolic AI, and abstraction in neuro-symbolic AI. In this perspective paper, we combine insights from AI and cognitive science to identify key commonalities and differences across three dimensions: notions of generalisation, methods for generalisation, and evaluation of generalisation. We map the different conceptualisations of generalisation in AI and cognitive science along these three dimensions and consider their role in human-AI teaming. This results in interdisciplinary challenges across AI and cognitive science that must be tackled to provide a foundation for effective and cognitively supported alignment in human-AI teaming scenarios."

    "title": "A Probabilistic Approach for Alignment with Human Comparisons",
    "published_date": "2024-03-16",
    "abstract": "A growing trend involves integrating human knowledge into learning frameworks, leveraging subtle human feedback to refine AI models. Despite these advances, no comprehensive theoretical framework describing the specific conditions under which human comparisons improve the traditional supervised fine-tuning process has been developed. To bridge this gap, this paper studies the effective use of human comparisons to address limitations arising from noisy data and high-dimensional models. We propose a two-stage\"Supervised Fine Tuning+Human Comparison\"(SFT+HC) framework connecting machine learning with human feedback through a probabilistic bisection approach. The two-stage framework first learns low-dimensional representations from noisy-labeled data via an SFT procedure, and then uses human comparisons to improve the model alignment. To examine the efficacy of the alignment phase, we introduce a novel concept termed the\"label-noise-to-comparison-accuracy\"(LNCA) ratio. This paper theoretically identifies the conditions under which the\"SFT+HC\"framework outperforms pure SFT approach, leveraging this ratio to highlight the advantage of incorporating human evaluators in reducing sample complexity. We validate that the proposed conditions for the LNCA ratio are met in a case study conducted via an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment."

    "title": "When Does Perceptual Alignment Benefit Vision Representations?",
    "published_date": "2024-10-14",
    "abstract": "Humans judge perceptual similarity according to diverse visual attributes, including scene layout, subject location, and camera pose. Existing vision models understand a wide range of semantic abstractions but improperly weigh these attributes and thus make inferences misaligned with human perception. While vision representations have previously benefited from alignment in contexts like image generation, the utility of perceptually aligned representations in more general-purpose settings remains unclear. Here, we investigate how aligning vision model representations to human perceptual judgments impacts their usability across diverse computer vision tasks. We finetune state-of-the-art models on human similarity judgments for image triplets and evaluate them across standard vision benchmarks. We find that aligning models to perceptual judgments yields representations that improve upon the original backbones across many downstream tasks, including counting, segmentation, depth estimation, instance retrieval, and retrieval-augmented generation. In addition, we find that performance is widely preserved on other tasks, including specialized out-of-distribution domains such as in medical imaging and 3D environment frames. Our results suggest that injecting an inductive bias about human perceptual knowledge into vision models can contribute to better representations.",
