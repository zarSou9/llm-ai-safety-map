    "published_date": "2022-02-18",
    "abstract": "Abstract We formulate and explore two basic axiomatic systems of type-free subjective probability. One of them explicates a notion of finitely additive probability. The other explicates a concept of infinitely additive probability. It is argued that the first of these systems is a suitable background theory for formally investigating controversial principles about type-free subjective probability.",

    "title": "Axiomatic Rejection for the Propositional Fragment of Le\\'{s}niewski's Ontology",
    "published_date": "2021-08-14",
    "abstract": "A Hilbert-type axiomatic rejection HAR for the propositional fragment L1 of Leśniewski's ontology is proposed. Also a Gentzentype axiomatic rejection GAR of L1 is proposed. Models for L1 are introduced. By axiomatic rejection, Ishimoto's embedding theorem will be proved. One of our main theorems is: Theorem (Main Theorem) ⊢T A ⇐⇒ ⊢H A ⇐⇒ TA is valid in first-order predicate logic with equality ⇐⇒ not Ȫ3H A. where ⊢T A means that A is provable in the tableau method of L1, while ⊢H A means that A is provable in the Hilbert-type L1. In the last section, as the chracterization theorem, we shall show: Theorem (Characterization Theorem) The following statements are equivalent: (1) The Cut elimination theorem for the Gentzen-type L1 (i.e. tableau method) holds, (2) No Hintikka formula of the form A1 ∨ A2 ∨ · · · ∨ An (n ≥ 1) is provable in the Hilbert-type L1, where Ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n) is an atomic formula or a negated atomic one, ∗Deceased. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Professor Emeritus Arata Ishimoto. This paper is cited in Ishimoto [27].",

    "published_date": "2021-01-05",
    "abstract": "Abstract Frege's definition of the real numbers, as envisaged in the second volume of Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, is fatally flawed by the inconsistency of Frege's ill-fated Basic Law V. We restate Frege's definition in a consistent logical framework and investigate whether it can provide a logical foundation of real analysis. Our conclusion will deem it doubtful that such a foundation along the lines of Frege's own indications is possible at all.",
