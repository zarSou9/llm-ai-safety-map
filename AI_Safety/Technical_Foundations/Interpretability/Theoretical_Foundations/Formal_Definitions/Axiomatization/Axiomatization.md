### Mini Description

Development of fundamental axioms and properties that any interpretation method should satisfy, including consistency, completeness, and faithfulness requirements.

### Description

Axiomatization in AI interpretability focuses on establishing fundamental mathematical properties that form the basis for rigorous interpretation methods. This involves identifying and formally specifying the essential characteristics that any valid interpretation approach must satisfy, such as consistency across similar inputs, faithfulness to the underlying model, and completeness in capturing relevant decision factors. The goal is to move beyond ad-hoc interpretation methods toward a principled foundation that enables formal reasoning about interpretation validity.

A key challenge in axiomatization is balancing the competing demands of mathematical precision and practical utility. The axioms must be strong enough to guarantee meaningful interpretations while remaining flexible enough to accommodate different types of models and explanation needs. Researchers work to identify minimal sets of axioms that capture essential properties while avoiding over-constraint, and to understand the relationships and trade-offs between different axiomatic requirements.

Current research explores how axioms should scale with model complexity and capability, particularly for systems exhibiting emergent behaviors or operating across multiple levels of abstraction. Open questions include how to formalize axioms for interpretability in the context of uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning, how to handle temporal aspects of interpretation, and how to develop axioms that remain meaningful as AI systems become more sophisticated. There is also growing interest in understanding the theoretical limits imposed by different axiomatic frameworks and their implications for practical interpretation methods.
