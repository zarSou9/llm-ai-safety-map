### Mini Description

Mathematical frameworks and formal approaches to defining and measuring interpretability, including information theory and causality.

### Description

Theoretical Foundations of interpretability research focuses on developing rigorous mathematical frameworks for understanding and measuring the explainability of AI systems. This includes formal definitions of interpretability, mathematical characterizations of explanation quality, and theoretical bounds on what can and cannot be explained about neural networks. The field draws from information theory, statistical learning theory, and complexity theory to establish principled approaches for quantifying and evaluating interpretability methods.

A key area of investigation is the development of formal metrics and measures for interpretability. This includes work on information-theoretic approaches to quantifying explanation completeness, formal definitions of simplicity and faithfulness in explanations, and theoretical frameworks for understanding the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability. Researchers also explore the fundamental limits of interpretability, including impossibility results and necessary conditions for meaningful explanations.

Current research challenges include developing unified theoretical frameworks that can bridge different approaches to interpretability, establishing formal connections between interpretability and other desirable properties like robustness and generalization, and creating mathematical tools for validating interpretation methods. The field also grapples with fundamental questions about the relationship between different forms of interpretability and how they relate to human understanding and verification of AI systems.
