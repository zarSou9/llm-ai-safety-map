### Mini Description

Identification and characterization of ways models can fail or exhibit undesired behaviors, including edge cases and unexpected responses.

### Description

Failure Mode Analysis in AI systems involves systematically identifying, categorizing, and understanding the ways in which models can malfunction, produce undesired outputs, or exhibit harmful behaviors. This includes both obvious failure patterns, such as producing factually incorrect outputs, and more subtle issues like implicit biases, reward hacking, or goal misspecification. The analysis encompasses both empirical observation of failure instances and theoretical work to anticipate potential failure modes before they manifest.

A key challenge in this field is developing comprehensive frameworks for detecting and characterizing failure modes across different model architectures and deployment contexts. This requires both proactive testing approaches to identify potential failures before deployment and reactive systems to detect and analyze failures in production environments. Researchers must also grapple with the challenge of distinguishing between genuine model limitations and failures that indicate deeper architectural or training issues.

Current research focuses on developing automated tools for failure detection, creating taxonomies of failure patterns, and understanding the root causes of different failure modes. This includes work on adversarial examples, out-of-distribution detection, and specification gaming. As models become more capable, new challenges emerge in identifying subtle and complex failure modes that may only manifest under specific conditions or through intricate chains of reasoning.
