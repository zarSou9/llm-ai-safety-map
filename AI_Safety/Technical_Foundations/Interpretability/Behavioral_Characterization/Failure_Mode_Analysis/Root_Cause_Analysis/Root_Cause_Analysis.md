### Mini Description

Investigation of the fundamental reasons behind observed failures, including analysis of model architecture, training data, and optimization processes that contribute to specific failure modes.

### Description

Root Cause Analysis in AI failure modes focuses on identifying and understanding the fundamental factors that lead to model failures, malfunctions, or undesired behaviors. This investigative process traces observed failures back to their origins, whether in model architecture, training procedures, data quality, optimization objectives, or environmental factors. The analysis requires both empirical investigation through controlled experiments and theoretical reasoning about model properties and training dynamics.

A key challenge is the inherent complexity and interconnectedness of potential causes. Failures often emerge from subtle interactions between multiple factors rather than single, isolated causes. Researchers must develop systematic approaches to disentangle these relationships, using techniques from ablation studies and counterfactual analysis to statistical inference and causal modeling. This is particularly challenging in deep learning systems where the relationship between training choices and model behaviors can be highly non-linear and context-dependent.

Current research emphasizes the development of rigorous methodologies for investigating failure origins, including tools for analyzing training dynamics, methods for identifying critical points in model development that lead to specific behaviors, and frameworks for understanding how architectural choices influence failure modes. Open questions include how to effectively isolate causal factors in complex systems, how to distinguish between fundamental limitations and implementation issues, and how to develop more robust approaches to preventing identified failure modes.
