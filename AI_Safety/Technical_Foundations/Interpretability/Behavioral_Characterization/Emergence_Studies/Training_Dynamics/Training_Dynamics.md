### Mini Description

Analysis of how different training approaches and architectures influence the emergence and development of model capabilities over time.

### Description

Training Dynamics research investigates how AI systems evolve and develop capabilities throughout the training process, focusing on understanding the patterns, stages, and factors that influence learning trajectories. This includes studying how different architectural choices, optimization algorithms, and training protocols affect the order and manner in which capabilities emerge, as well as identifying critical periods or phases during training where important behavioral changes occur.

A key focus is on understanding the relationship between local optimization steps and global behavioral development. Researchers analyze phenomena like loss landscape evolution, gradient flow patterns, and representation formation to understand how low-level training dynamics give rise to high-level capabilities. This includes studying how different components of neural networks develop and interact during training, and how various training interventions can shape this development.

Current challenges include developing better tools for monitoring and intervening in training processes, understanding the role of different training phases in shaping final model behavior, and identifying early indicators of problematic training trajectories. The field increasingly emphasizes the need for theoretical frameworks that can predict training outcomes and guide intervention strategies, particularly for large-scale models where empirical investigation becomes computationally expensive.
