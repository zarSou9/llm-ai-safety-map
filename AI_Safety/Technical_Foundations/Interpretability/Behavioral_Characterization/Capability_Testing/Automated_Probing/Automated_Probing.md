### Mini Description

Development of automated systems that can systematically test for and measure model capabilities, including adaptive testing approaches that can explore capability boundaries.

### Description

Automated Probing focuses on developing systematic, scalable methods for automatically testing and discovering AI model capabilities without requiring constant human oversight. This involves creating adaptive algorithms that can generate test cases, evaluate responses, and iteratively refine their testing strategies based on model behavior. The approach aims to move beyond static test suites to more dynamic and comprehensive capability assessment.

Current research emphasizes the development of probe generators that can automatically construct meaningful test cases across different domains and complexity levels. These systems often employ techniques from active learning and optimization to efficiently explore the space of possible tests, identifying boundary cases and potential failure modes. A key challenge is ensuring that automated probes remain semantically meaningful and practically relevant while maintaining computational efficiency.

Emerging areas include the development of self-improving probe systems that can learn from previous testing episodes, meta-learning approaches for generating domain-specific probes, and frameworks for validating the quality and coverage of automated test generation. Researchers are particularly focused on creating probes that can adapt to increasing model capabilities and detect subtle behavioral changes that might indicate the emergence of new capabilities or potential risks.
