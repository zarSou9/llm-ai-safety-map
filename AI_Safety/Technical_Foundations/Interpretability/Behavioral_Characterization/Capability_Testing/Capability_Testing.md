### Mini Description

Systematic approaches to identifying and measuring specific model abilities, including both intended capabilities and emergent behaviors.

### Description

Capability Testing in AI systems involves developing systematic methodologies to identify, measure, and validate the range of abilities that models possess. This includes both testing for intended capabilities that were explicitly part of the training objectives and discovering unintended capabilities that may have emerged during training. The approach requires creating comprehensive test suites, developing metrics for capability measurement, and establishing protocols for consistent evaluation across different models and contexts.

A key challenge in capability testing is determining appropriate benchmarks and evaluation criteria that can meaningfully assess complex abilities. This is particularly challenging for advanced language models and multi-modal systems where capabilities may be context-dependent or manifest in subtle ways. Researchers must balance between testing for specific, well-defined abilities and exploring the boundaries of more abstract or emergent capabilities.

Current research focuses on developing more rigorous and automated testing frameworks that can scale with model complexity. This includes creating adaptive test generators that can probe for specific abilities, designing evaluation metrics that capture nuanced aspects of performance, and establishing standardized protocols for capability assessment. Open questions include how to test for capabilities that may only emerge in specific contexts, how to verify the reliability and consistency of observed abilities, and how to ensure test suites remain relevant as AI systems become more sophisticated.
