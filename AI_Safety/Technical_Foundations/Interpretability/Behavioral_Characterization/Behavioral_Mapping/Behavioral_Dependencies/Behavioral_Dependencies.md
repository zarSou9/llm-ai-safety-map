### Mini Description

Analysis of how different behaviors relate to and influence each other, including prerequisite relationships and interaction effects.

### Description

Behavioral Dependencies research focuses on understanding and mapping the relationships between different AI system behaviors and capabilities. This includes identifying which behaviors are prerequisites for others, how different capabilities interact and influence each other, and how the presence or absence of certain behaviors affects the overall system dynamics. The work combines empirical observation with theoretical modeling to build comprehensive dependency graphs and interaction matrices.

A key challenge is distinguishing between true dependencies and mere correlations in behavioral emergence. Researchers employ various methodologies including ablation studies, controlled capability introduction, and comparative analysis across different model architectures and scales. This helps identify both direct causal relationships and more subtle interaction effects that may only manifest under specific conditions or at certain capability thresholds.

The field is particularly focused on understanding how dependencies scale with model size and complexity, and how they might inform safer training trajectories. Current research questions include whether certain dependency patterns could serve as early warning signs for potentially problematic capabilities, how to leverage understood dependencies to guide model development, and whether there exist universal patterns in behavioral dependencies across different AI architectures.
