### Mini Description

Methods for assessing the completeness of behavioral maps and identifying unexplored or undercharacterized behavioral spaces.

### Description

Coverage Analysis in behavioral mapping focuses on systematically evaluating how completely and accurately our current behavioral maps capture the full range of possible AI system behaviors. This involves developing metrics and methodologies to identify gaps in our understanding, assess the comprehensiveness of existing taxonomies, and prioritize areas for further investigation. The field combines theoretical approaches to defining behavioral spaces with empirical methods for detecting unexplored or undercharacterized behaviors.

A key challenge is dealing with the potentially infinite space of possible behaviors, especially in complex AI systems. Researchers employ various strategies including formal methods to bound behavioral spaces, statistical sampling approaches to estimate coverage, and comparative analysis across different models and contexts to identify systematic blind spots. The field also grapples with questions of granularity - determining the appropriate level of detail at which to analyze behavioral coverage.

Current research emphasizes the development of automated tools and frameworks for continuous coverage monitoring, particularly as AI systems become more capable and exhibit increasingly sophisticated behaviors. Open questions include how to detect and characterize previously unknown categories of behavior, how to assess coverage across different levels of abstraction, and how to prioritize which gaps in coverage pose the greatest risks or opportunities for understanding.
