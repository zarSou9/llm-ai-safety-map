### Mini Description

Creation of comprehensive taxonomies and frameworks for categorizing and documenting model behaviors across different contexts and input types.

### Description

Behavioral Mapping focuses on developing systematic frameworks and methodologies for cataloging and organizing the full spectrum of behaviors exhibited by AI systems. This involves creating structured taxonomies that capture both basic functionalities and complex behavioral patterns, enabling researchers to track how different behaviors relate to each other and identify gaps in our understanding. The goal is to build comprehensive maps that can serve as references for understanding model capabilities, limitations, and potential risks.

Current approaches combine both top-down theoretical frameworks and bottom-up empirical observations. Researchers develop classification schemes based on cognitive science, linguistics, and computer science principles, while also conducting extensive empirical studies to document observed behaviors. A key challenge is developing taxonomies that are both precise enough to capture meaningful distinctions and flexible enough to accommodate novel behaviors as they emerge.

The field grapples with several open questions, including how to create standardized vocabularies for describing AI behaviors, how to handle behaviors that don't fit neatly into existing categories, and how to map increasingly complex behavioral interactions in advanced systems. There's also ongoing work on developing metrics and visualization techniques to represent behavioral landscapes in ways that highlight important patterns and relationships.
