### Mini Description

Techniques for directly studying model weights, connectivity patterns, and architectural elements to understand systematic feature processing and importance hierarchies.

### Description

Architecture Analysis in global attribution focuses on systematically examining the structural elements and learned parameters of AI models to understand how they process and prioritize features. This involves analyzing weight matrices, activation patterns, and connectivity structures to identify stable pathways and hierarchies that determine feature importance across the model. The approach provides insights into how architectural decisions and training dynamics shape a model's information processing capabilities.

Current research emphasizes both static analysis of trained models and dynamic studies of how architectural components evolve during training. Key techniques include weight pruning analysis to identify critical pathways, attention head studies in transformer architectures, and topological analysis of neural connectivity patterns. Researchers also investigate how different architectural choices, such as skip connections, normalization layers, and activation functions, influence feature processing and importance attribution.

Major challenges include developing scalable methods for analyzing increasingly large architectures, establishing causal relationships between architectural elements and model behaviors, and creating meaningful visualizations of high-dimensional weight spaces. The field is particularly focused on understanding how architectural motifs emerge during training and how they relate to model capabilities, with growing interest in identifying universal patterns across different architectures and tasks.
