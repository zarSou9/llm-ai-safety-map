### Mini Description

Methods for understanding feature importance across entire models or datasets, including feature importance ranking and systematic pattern analysis.

### Description

Global Attribution Analysis focuses on understanding how different features and patterns systematically influence model behavior across entire datasets or model architectures. Unlike local attribution methods that explain individual predictions, global approaches aim to identify consistent patterns of feature importance, recurring activation motifs, and general behavioral characteristics that shape a model's decision-making process.

Current research approaches include aggregating local attributions across many examples to identify stable patterns, directly analyzing model weights and architectures to understand feature processing pathways, and developing statistical frameworks for quantifying feature importance across different contexts. These methods must address challenges such as distinguishing genuine patterns from spurious correlations, handling feature interactions that only emerge at scale, and developing metrics that meaningfully summarize complex attribution patterns.

A key focus is developing techniques that remain interpretable and computationally feasible as model size and dataset complexity increase. This includes research on efficient sampling strategies, dimensionality reduction methods for attribution analysis, and approaches for identifying hierarchical patterns of feature importance. The field increasingly emphasizes the need for methods that can handle different types of features (continuous, categorical, structured) and account for dataset-level properties like class imbalance or correlation structures.
