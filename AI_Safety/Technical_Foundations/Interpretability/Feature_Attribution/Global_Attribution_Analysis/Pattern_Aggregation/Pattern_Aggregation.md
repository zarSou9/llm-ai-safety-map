### Mini Description

Methods for combining and analyzing local attribution patterns across many examples to identify consistent feature importance relationships and behavioral motifs.

### Description

Pattern Aggregation in global attribution analysis focuses on systematically combining and analyzing local attribution patterns across multiple examples to uncover consistent relationships and behavioral motifs in AI systems. This involves developing methods to identify stable patterns of feature importance that persist across different inputs, contexts, and model states, while filtering out noise and spurious correlations. The field encompasses both supervised approaches that leverage known patterns or desired behaviors, and unsupervised techniques that discover emergent attribution patterns.

Key challenges include handling the combinatorial complexity of feature interactions, developing robust statistical methods for pattern significance testing, and creating meaningful visualizations of aggregated patterns. Researchers must address issues of pattern stability across different model initializations or training runs, and develop methods to distinguish fundamental patterns from artifacts of specific architectures or training procedures. Current approaches range from frequency-based analysis of attribution patterns to more sophisticated techniques using dimensionality reduction and clustering.

Emerging research directions focus on developing hierarchical representations of attribution patterns, understanding how patterns evolve during model training, and creating interactive tools for pattern exploration. There is growing interest in connecting pattern aggregation to causal understanding, investigating how discovered patterns relate to model capabilities, and developing methods that can scale to handle the massive feature spaces of modern AI systems. The field increasingly emphasizes the need for theoretical frameworks to characterize pattern significance and stability.
