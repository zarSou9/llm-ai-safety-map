### Mini Description

Methods that aim to identify causal relationships between inputs and outputs, distinguishing correlation from causation in model behavior.

### Description

Causal attribution in AI interpretability focuses on identifying and validating genuine cause-and-effect relationships between inputs, internal model components, and outputs. Unlike correlative attribution methods, causal approaches aim to understand how interventions on inputs or model components actually influence outcomes, drawing from formal frameworks in causal inference and counterfactual reasoning. This includes developing methods to distinguish between features that are merely correlated with outputs and those that causally influence model decisions.

Current research emphasizes the development of rigorous mathematical frameworks for defining and measuring causal effects in neural networks. This includes techniques for constructing causal graphs of model behavior, methods for performing controlled interventions on model components, and approaches for generating and evaluating counterfactual explanations. A key challenge is handling the complex, non-linear nature of neural networks, where traditional causal inference assumptions may not hold.

Emerging areas of focus include the relationship between causal attribution and model robustness, the role of causal understanding in identifying and mitigating spurious correlations, and the development of training procedures that encourage models to learn causal rather than merely statistical relationships. Researchers are also investigating how causal attribution methods can be used to understand emergent capabilities in large language models and to verify alignment properties.
