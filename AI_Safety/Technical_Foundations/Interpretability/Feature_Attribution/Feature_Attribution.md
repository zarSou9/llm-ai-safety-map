### Mini Description

Methods for identifying which inputs or internal representations are most important for specific predictions or behaviors.

### Description

Feature attribution in AI interpretability focuses on identifying and quantifying the importance of different inputs, neurons, or internal representations in determining a model's outputs. This encompasses methods ranging from simple sensitivity analyses to sophisticated attribution techniques that account for complex interactions between features. The field aims to answer questions about which parts of an input most influenced a particular decision, how different components of a model contribute to its predictions, and how feature interactions lead to specific outcomes.

Current approaches can be broadly categorized into local and global attribution methods. Local methods explain individual predictions by assigning importance scores to input features or internal activations for specific instances. Global methods aim to understand feature importance across the entire model or dataset, often through aggregation of local explanations or direct analysis of model parameters. Both approaches must contend with challenges like attribution ambiguity, where multiple valid explanations exist for the same prediction, and the stability of attributions across similar inputs.

Key research challenges include developing attribution methods that scale to large language models and multi-modal systems, handling feature interactions and non-linear effects accurately, and ensuring attribution methods are themselves interpretable and reliable. There is also growing focus on causal attribution approaches that go beyond correlation-based explanations, and on methods that can attribute responsibility to specific training examples or model components. The field increasingly emphasizes the need for theoretical frameworks to evaluate attribution quality and reliability.
