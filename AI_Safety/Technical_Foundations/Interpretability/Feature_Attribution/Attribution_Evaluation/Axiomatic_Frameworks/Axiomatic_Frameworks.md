### Mini Description

Development and application of formal mathematical properties that attribution methods should satisfy, including completeness, sensitivity, and implementation invariance.

### Description

Axiomatic Frameworks in attribution evaluation establish formal mathematical properties that feature attribution methods must satisfy to be considered theoretically sound. These frameworks provide a rigorous foundation for analyzing and comparing different attribution approaches by defining essential characteristics such as completeness (attributions sum to the model output), sensitivity (relevant features receive non-zero attribution), and implementation invariance (attributions remain consistent across equivalent implementations).

Current research focuses on developing comprehensive axiom sets that capture both theoretical requirements and practical considerations. This includes exploring the relationships and potential trade-offs between different axioms, proving impossibility results for certain combinations of desirable properties, and extending existing frameworks to handle more complex model architectures and attribution scenarios. Key challenges include balancing the competing demands of different axioms and developing frameworks that remain tractable for modern deep learning systems.

Emerging areas of investigation include axioms for handling feature interactions, temporal dependencies, and uncertainty in attributions. Researchers are also working to bridge the gap between theoretical axioms and practical utility, developing frameworks that incorporate both mathematical rigor and real-world requirements. This includes exploring how axioms should be modified or relaxed in different contexts and developing methods to verify axiom satisfaction in practice.
