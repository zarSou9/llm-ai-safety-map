### Mini Description

Frameworks and metrics for assessing the quality, reliability, and consistency of feature attribution methods, including axiomatic approaches and empirical validation techniques.

### Description

Attribution Evaluation focuses on developing and applying rigorous frameworks to assess the quality and reliability of feature attribution methods in AI systems. This includes creating theoretical foundations for what constitutes a 'good' attribution, developing metrics to measure attribution quality, and establishing validation procedures to ensure attribution methods provide meaningful and trustworthy explanations of model behavior.

Current research emphasizes both axiomatic approaches, which define formal properties that attribution methods should satisfy, and empirical validation techniques that test attribution methods against ground truth data or human intuition. Key challenges include handling attribution ambiguity, where multiple valid explanations exist, measuring attribution stability across similar inputs, and developing evaluation metrics that scale to complex models and high-dimensional data.

The field is increasingly focused on context-dependent evaluation, recognizing that the appropriate criteria for attribution quality may vary based on the application domain and intended use. This includes developing specialized evaluation frameworks for different types of models (e.g., vision models vs. language models) and different attribution goals (e.g., debugging vs. regulatory compliance). Research also emphasizes the need for human-centered evaluation metrics that align with how practitioners actually use and interpret attribution results.
