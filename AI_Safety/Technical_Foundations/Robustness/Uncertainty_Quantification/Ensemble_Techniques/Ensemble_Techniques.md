### Mini Description

Methods that combine multiple models or predictions to estimate uncertainty, including bootstrap ensembles and deep ensembles.

### Description

Ensemble Techniques in uncertainty quantification combine multiple models or predictions to estimate uncertainty in AI systems. This approach leverages the principle that different models, trained with varying initializations, architectures, or data subsets, will produce diverse predictions that can be aggregated to provide more reliable uncertainty estimates. The disagreement between ensemble members serves as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty, while their collective behavior can capture aleatoric uncertainty.

Current research focuses on developing computationally efficient ensemble methods that maintain reliability while scaling to large models and complex tasks. Key challenges include determining optimal ensemble size, managing the trade-off between diversity and accuracy, and developing aggregation strategies that preserve calibration. Recent work has explored implicit ensembles through dropout and other stochastic regularization techniques, as well as methods for creating ensembles that are particularly sensitive to out-of-distribution inputs.

Emerging directions include adaptive ensemble methods that dynamically adjust their composition or weighting based on task demands, and techniques for creating ensembles that are specifically optimized for uncertainty estimation rather than just prediction accuracy. There is also growing interest in understanding the theoretical foundations of why ensembles provide good uncertainty estimates and developing methods to guarantee certain uncertainty properties.
