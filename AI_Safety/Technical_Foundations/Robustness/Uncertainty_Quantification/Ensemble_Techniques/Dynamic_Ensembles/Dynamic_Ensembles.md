### Mini Description

Methods for adaptively selecting or weighting ensemble members based on input characteristics or task requirements, including mixture of experts and conditional computation approaches.

### Description

Dynamic Ensembles represent an advanced approach to ensemble learning where the composition, weighting, or structure of the ensemble adapts based on input characteristics, task requirements, or environmental conditions. Unlike static ensembles where all members contribute equally or through fixed weights, dynamic ensembles intelligently allocate computational resources and combine predictions in a context-dependent manner. This enables more efficient and accurate uncertainty estimation while potentially reducing computational overhead.

Current research focuses on developing mechanisms for conditional computation and adaptive routing within ensemble architectures. Key approaches include learned gating networks that direct inputs to relevant expert models, attention-based mechanisms that dynamically weight ensemble members, and meta-learning approaches that adapt ensemble composition on-the-fly. These methods must balance the trade-off between adaptation flexibility and stability, ensuring that dynamic changes in ensemble behavior remain reliable and interpretable.

Emerging challenges include developing theoretically grounded approaches to dynamic ensemble construction, ensuring robust performance under distribution shift, and creating efficient training procedures for large-scale adaptive systems. There is particular interest in methods that can automatically identify when to add or remove ensemble members, adjust the diversity of the ensemble, or modify the aggregation strategy based on task difficulty or uncertainty requirements.
