### Mini Description

Methods for accurately estimating and representing uncertainty in AI system outputs and internal states, enabling more reliable decision-making under uncertainty.

### Description

Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in AI safety focuses on developing rigorous methods for understanding and representing the various forms of uncertainty present in AI systems. This includes both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness in data or processes) and epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty due to limited knowledge or model limitations). The field draws from probability theory, statistics, and information theory to create frameworks that enable AI systems to accurately express their confidence levels and knowledge limitations.

Current research emphasizes the challenges of calibrating uncertainty estimates in deep learning models, which tend to be overconfident in their predictions. This has led to the development of various approaches, from Bayesian neural networks and ensemble methods to direct uncertainty modeling through specialized architectures. A key focus is on creating computationally tractable methods that scale to large models while maintaining reliable uncertainty estimates across different operating conditions.

Emerging directions include research on uncertainty awareness in decision-making processes, where systems must appropriately incorporate uncertainty estimates into their actions. This connects to questions of safe exploration, risk-aware planning, and robust decision-making under uncertainty. There's also increasing attention to the challenge of unknown unknowns - developing methods for detecting and handling situations where the system's uncertainty estimates themselves may be unreliable.
