### Mini Description

Techniques that not only detect but also analyze and categorize the nature of distribution shifts, providing interpretable feedback about how inputs differ from training data.

### Description

Characterization Methods in out-of-distribution detection focus on not just identifying when inputs deviate from the training distribution, but also understanding and categorizing the nature of these deviations. This involves developing techniques to analyze the specific ways in which new inputs differ from training data, whether through semantic shifts, structural changes, or novel feature combinations. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can guide appropriate system responses and help maintain safe operation.

Current research approaches include methods for decomposing distribution shifts into interpretable components, techniques for identifying which features or combinations of features are responsible for OOD detection, and frameworks for categorizing different types of distribution shift. This often involves combining multiple analysis techniques, from feature attribution methods to counterfactual reasoning, to build a comprehensive understanding of how and why inputs deviate from expected patterns.

A key challenge in characterization is developing methods that can provide useful insights across different types and scales of distribution shift, from subtle domain shifts to completely novel scenarios. This connects to fundamental questions about the nature of similarity and difference in high-dimensional spaces, and how to meaningfully communicate complex statistical patterns to human operators. Emerging research directions include developing hierarchical characterization frameworks that can describe shifts at multiple levels of abstraction, and methods for identifying potential safety implications of detected shifts.
