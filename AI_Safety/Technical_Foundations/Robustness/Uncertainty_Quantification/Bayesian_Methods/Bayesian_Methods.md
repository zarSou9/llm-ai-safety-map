### Mini Description

Approaches based on Bayesian probability theory for representing and updating uncertainty, including Bayesian neural networks and variational inference techniques.

### Description

Bayesian methods in AI safety provide a principled framework for reasoning about uncertainty by treating model parameters and predictions as probability distributions rather than point estimates. These approaches enable systems to naturally represent uncertainty, update beliefs given new evidence, and make decisions that account for multiple possible worlds. The core challenge lies in developing tractable approximations that maintain Bayesian properties while scaling to modern deep learning architectures.

Current research focuses on several key areas: developing more efficient variational inference techniques that can handle complex posterior distributions, creating structured priors that encode useful inductive biases, and designing architectures that support Bayesian reasoning while remaining computationally feasible. A particular emphasis is placed on methods that can provide calibrated uncertainty estimates and gracefully handle out-of-distribution scenarios, where traditional deep learning models often fail catastrophically.

Emerging directions include work on hierarchical Bayesian models that can capture different levels of uncertainty, meta-learning approaches that adapt Bayesian inference procedures to specific tasks, and hybrid methods that combine Bayesian principles with other uncertainty quantification techniques. There's also increasing interest in understanding the theoretical limitations of Bayesian approaches in the context of deep learning, particularly regarding the trade-offs between computational tractability and faithful uncertainty representation.
