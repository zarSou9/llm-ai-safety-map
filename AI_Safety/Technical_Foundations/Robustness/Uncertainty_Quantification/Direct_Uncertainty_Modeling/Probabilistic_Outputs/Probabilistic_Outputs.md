### Mini Description

Methods for directly outputting probability distributions or distribution parameters instead of point estimates, including techniques like evidential deep learning and distribution parameter prediction.

### Description

Probabilistic Outputs focuses on methods for training neural networks to directly output probability distributions or distribution parameters rather than point estimates. This approach enables models to express uncertainty through their native output structure, capturing both the predicted values and their associated uncertainty in a single forward pass. The field encompasses various techniques, from predicting parameters of known probability distributions to learning flexible, arbitrary distributions through normalizing flows or mixture models.

A central challenge is choosing appropriate distributional forms that can adequately capture the uncertainty structure of the problem while remaining computationally tractable and interpretable. Simple parametric distributions (like Gaussian) may be insufficient for complex real-world uncertainties, while more flexible distributions can be difficult to train or may suffer from numerical instabilities. Researchers must also address the challenge of learning valid probability distributions, ensuring outputs satisfy probability axioms and maintain proper normalization.

Recent advances have focused on developing more expressive distributional forms while maintaining computational efficiency. This includes work on implicit distributions, where the network learns to generate samples directly without explicitly modeling the probability density, and hybrid approaches that combine parametric and non-parametric elements. Emerging research directions explore methods for capturing multimodal uncertainties, handling correlations between outputs, and ensuring proper coverage of the true underlying distribution.
