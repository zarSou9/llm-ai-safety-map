### Mini Description

Approaches for ensuring predicted uncertainty values accurately reflect true confidence levels, including specialized loss functions and post-hoc calibration methods.

### Description

Calibration Techniques in uncertainty quantification focus on ensuring that an AI system's predicted confidence levels accurately reflect its true probability of correctness. A perfectly calibrated model would be correct exactly p% of the time when it reports p% confidence. This fundamental property is crucial for reliable decision-making and safe deployment of AI systems, particularly in high-stakes applications where understanding prediction reliability is essential.

Current research approaches span both training-time and post-hoc calibration methods. Training-time techniques include specialized loss functions that explicitly penalize miscalibration, temperature scaling during training, and regularization approaches that promote calibrated outputs. Post-hoc methods modify already-trained models through techniques like Platt scaling, isotonic regression, and distribution matching, allowing calibration without retraining while potentially sacrificing some performance.

A key challenge in calibration is maintaining reliability across different operating conditions and data distributions. This has led to research on distribution-aware calibration methods, adaptive techniques that continuously update calibration parameters, and approaches for quantifying calibration uncertainty itself. Emerging work also explores the relationship between calibration and model architecture, investigating how different neural network designs inherently affect calibration properties.
