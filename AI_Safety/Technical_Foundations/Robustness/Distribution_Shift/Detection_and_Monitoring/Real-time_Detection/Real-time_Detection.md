### Mini Description

Algorithms and systems designed for efficient, continuous monitoring of distribution shifts in production environments, including streaming data approaches.

### Description

Real-time detection of distribution shifts focuses on developing computationally efficient algorithms and system architectures capable of continuously monitoring AI system inputs and outputs for meaningful distributional changes. This requires balancing the trade-off between detection accuracy and computational overhead, while maintaining low latency to enable timely interventions when shifts occur. Key challenges include handling high-dimensional data streams, managing memory constraints, and distinguishing between temporary fluctuations and genuine distribution shifts.

Current approaches span multiple techniques, from lightweight statistical tests that can be computed incrementally to more sophisticated learning-based methods that maintain low-dimensional representations for efficient comparison. Research emphasizes the development of anytime algorithms that can provide preliminary assessments quickly while refining their analysis with additional computation time. This includes work on efficient approximate inference, streaming kernel methods, and adaptive sampling strategies that focus computational resources on the most informative data points.

Emerging directions focus on developing hierarchical monitoring systems that combine fast, coarse-grained checks with more detailed analysis triggered by suspicious patterns. There's increasing attention to resource-aware methods that can dynamically adjust their computational intensity based on system requirements and risk levels. Research also explores techniques for maintaining historical summaries that enable meaningful comparisons while respecting memory constraints, and methods for incorporating domain knowledge to improve detection efficiency.
