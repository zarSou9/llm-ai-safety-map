### Mini Description

Methods focusing on learning predictive models whose relationship between features and targets remains stable across environments, including IRM and its variants.

### Description

Invariant Prediction focuses on developing machine learning models that maintain consistent predictive relationships across different environments or distributions. The core challenge is identifying and leveraging stable patterns in the relationship between features and target variables, even when the underlying feature distributions change. This requires distinguishing between correlations that are artifacts of specific training environments and those that reflect fundamental, invariant relationships.

Current approaches include methods like Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and its variants, which explicitly optimize for predictors that perform optimally across all training environments while maintaining invariance. These are complemented by techniques that incorporate causal structure, such as anchor regression and instrumental variable methods, which aim to leverage additional assumptions about the data-generating process. Recent work has also explored connections to game theory and adversarial training, viewing invariant prediction as a form of equilibrium in a multi-player game.

Despite these advances, several key challenges remain unsolved. These include handling cases where perfect invariance is impossible or undesirable, developing computationally tractable algorithms for high-dimensional problems, and determining appropriate trade-offs between invariance and predictive power. There are also open questions about the theoretical foundations of invariant prediction, including the relationship between finite-sample guarantees and asymptotic behavior, and the minimal assumptions needed for successful invariant learning.
