### Mini Description

Approaches for learning data representations that capture invariant properties while remaining informative for downstream tasks, including disentanglement methods.

### Description

Stable Representation Learning focuses on developing techniques to learn data representations that capture invariant properties while remaining informative for downstream tasks. The core challenge lies in identifying and extracting features that are stable across different environments, domains, or conditions while preserving enough task-relevant information to enable effective learning. This involves balancing the trade-off between invariance and expressiveness, as representations that are too invariant may discard crucial information, while those that are too expressive may capture spurious correlations.

Current approaches span multiple paradigms, from contrastive learning methods that leverage natural data augmentations to identify stable features, to information-theoretic approaches that explicitly optimize for minimal sufficient representations. Recent work has explored the use of geometric constraints, topological properties, and symmetry-based methods to induce desired invariances. These are complemented by methods that learn disentangled representations, separating stable factors from varying ones.

Key open challenges include developing theoretical frameworks for characterizing the optimal level of invariance, creating methods that can adapt their degree of invariance based on task requirements, and scaling to high-dimensional spaces while maintaining computational efficiency. There's also increasing interest in learning representations that are simultaneously stable across multiple types of variation, and in understanding the relationship between representation stability and downstream task performance.
