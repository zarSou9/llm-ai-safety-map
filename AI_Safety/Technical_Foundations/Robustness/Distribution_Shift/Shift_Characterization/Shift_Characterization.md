### Mini Description

Theoretical frameworks and methods for identifying, categorizing, and measuring different types of distribution shift, including covariate shift, concept drift, and label shift.

### Description

Shift characterization in AI safety focuses on developing formal frameworks and methodologies to identify, classify, and measure different types of distribution shifts that can affect AI systems. This includes mathematical tools for quantifying divergence between distributions, taxonomies of shift types (e.g., covariate shift, concept drift, label shift), and theoretical analysis of how these shifts impact model performance. The field draws heavily from statistical theory while incorporating modern machine learning considerations.

Current research emphasizes the development of rigorous metrics for measuring distribution distance and shift severity, including f-divergences, optimal transport distances, and kernel-based methods. These approaches are being extended to handle high-dimensional spaces and complex data types typical in modern AI applications. Researchers are also working to bridge the gap between theoretical shift measures and practical detection methods, developing techniques that can operate efficiently on large-scale systems.

Key challenges include characterizing shifts in latent feature spaces, handling multiple simultaneous types of shift, and developing measures that correlate well with actual performance degradation. There's growing interest in causal approaches to shift characterization, which aim to identify fundamental mechanisms of change rather than just statistical patterns. The field is also exploring connections to adversarial robustness, investigating how different types of distribution shift relate to adversarial perturbations and natural robustness.
