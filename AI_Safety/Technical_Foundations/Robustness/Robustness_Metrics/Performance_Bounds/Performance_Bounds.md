Theoretical frameworks for establishing provable limits on performance degradation under specified conditions or perturbations.

### Description

Performance bounds research in AI robustness metrics focuses on developing theoretical frameworks that establish provable limits on how much an AI system's performance can degrade under specified conditions or perturbations. This involves mathematical techniques from optimization theory, statistical learning theory, and complexity analysis to derive rigorous bounds that hold regardless of specific implementations or architectures. These bounds provide fundamental insights into the limitations and trade-offs inherent in robust AI systems.

Current approaches span both worst-case and probabilistic frameworks, with methods ranging from PAC-learning bounds to adversarial robustness certificates. Key challenges include developing bounds that are both tight enough to be informative and general enough to apply across different types of perturbations and architectural choices. Researchers are particularly interested in bounds that can characterize the relationship between model capacity, dataset size, and achievable robustness.

Emerging research directions focus on developing bounds that account for more realistic threat models and operational constraints. This includes work on instance-specific bounds that provide tighter guarantees for particular inputs, compositional bounds for complex systems, and bounds that explicitly consider computational limitations. Open questions remain about how to bridge the gap between theoretical bounds and practical performance, especially in the context of deep learning systems where traditional theoretical tools often yield overly pessimistic results.
