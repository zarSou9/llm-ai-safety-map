### Mini Description

Statistical frameworks for bounding performance degradation with high probability, including concentration inequalities and PAC-learning approaches.

### Description

Probabilistic bounds in AI robustness metrics focus on developing statistical frameworks that quantify the likelihood of performance degradation under various perturbations and uncertainties. These approaches leverage probability theory and statistical learning theory to establish guarantees that hold with high probability, rather than absolute worst-case guarantees. This enables more nuanced and often tighter bounds that better reflect real-world performance characteristics while acknowledging the inherent randomness in both data and learning processes.

Current research emphasizes developing bounds that remain meaningful for modern deep learning architectures, where traditional PAC-learning bounds often prove too loose to be practical. Key approaches include concentration inequalities for specific architectures, distribution-dependent bounds that leverage problem structure, and adaptive bounds that tighten as more information becomes available. Researchers are particularly focused on bounds that can handle the high-dimensional nature of neural networks while maintaining computational tractability.

Emerging directions include the development of probabilistic certificates that provide guarantees under specific probability distributions, methods for combining multiple probabilistic bounds to create stronger certificates, and techniques for handling dependent perturbations. Open challenges include developing bounds that remain tight under distribution shift, establishing probabilistic guarantees for complex compositional systems, and creating frameworks that can effectively balance the trade-off between bound tightness and computational cost.
