### Mini Description

Theoretical bounds on system performance under worst-case scenarios, including minimax optimization approaches and adversarial certificates.

### Description

Worst-case guarantees in AI robustness focus on establishing rigorous mathematical bounds that hold even under the most adversarial or challenging conditions a system might encounter. These guarantees provide formal certificates of robustness by analyzing the maximum possible deviation in system performance across all potential inputs within specified perturbation sets. The approach draws from optimization theory, formal verification, and control theory to develop methods that can prove absolute limits on system behavior.

Current research emphasizes both the development of tighter bounds through novel mathematical frameworks and more efficient computational methods for verifying these bounds. Key challenges include handling the non-convex nature of deep neural networks, scaling verification methods to large models, and developing bounds that remain meaningful for practical applications. Researchers are particularly interested in methods that can provide useful guarantees without being overly conservative.

Emerging directions include the development of hybrid approaches that combine multiple verification techniques, instance-specific certification methods that provide tighter bounds for particular inputs, and frameworks for handling more complex threat models. There's increasing focus on connecting theoretical guarantees with practical robustness requirements, including work on compositional verification for large systems and methods for certifying more sophisticated properties beyond input-output relationships.
