    "abstract": "A memory consistency model specifies the allowed behaviors of shared memory concurrent programs. At the language level, these models are known to have a non-trivial impact on the safety of program optimizations, limiting the ability to rearrange/refactor code without introducing new behaviors. Existing programming language memory models try to address this by permitting more (relaxed/weak) concurrent behaviors but are still unable to allow all the desired optimizations. A core problem is that weaker consistency models may also render optimizations unsafe, a conclusion that goes against the intuition of them allowing more behaviors. This exposes an open problem of the compositional interaction between memory consistency semantics and optimizations: which parts of the semantics correspond to allowing/disallowing which set of optimizations is unclear. In this work, we establish a formal foundation suitable enough to understand this compositional nature, decomposing optimizations into a finite set of elementary effects on program execution traces, over which aspects of safety can be assessed. We use this decomposition to identify a desirable compositional property (complete) that would guarantee the safety of optimizations from one memory model to another. We showcase its practicality by proving such a property between Sequential Consistency (SC) and $SC_{RR}$, the latter allowing independent read-read reordering over $SC$. Our work potentially paves way to a new design methodology of programming-language memory models, one that places emphasis on the optimizations desired to be performed."

    "title": "Leveraging Compositional Methods for Modeling and Verification of an Autonomous Taxi System",
    "published_date": "2023-04-26",
    "abstract": "We apply a compositional formal modeling and verification method to an autonomous aircraft taxi system. We provide insights into the modeling approach and we identify several research areas where further development is needed. Specifically, we identify the following needs: (1) semantics of composition of viewpoints expressed in different specification languages, and tools to reason about heterogeneous declarative models; (2) libraries of formal models for autonomous systems to speed up modeling and enable efficient reasoning; (3) methods to lift verification results generated by automated reasoning tools to the specification level; (4) probabilistic contract frameworks to reason about imperfect implementations; (5) standard high-level functional architectures for autonomous systems; and (6) a theory of higher-order contracts. We believe that addressing these research needs, among others, could improve the adoption of formal methods in the design of autonomous systems including learning-enabled systems, and increase confidence in their safe operations.",
