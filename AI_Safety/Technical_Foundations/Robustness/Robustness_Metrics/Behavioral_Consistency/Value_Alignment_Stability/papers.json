    "published_date": "2024-10-24",
    "abstract": "Ensuring that generative AI systems align with human values is essential but challenging, especially when considering multiple human values and their potential trade-offs. Since human values can be personalized and dynamically change over time, the desirable levels of value alignment vary across different ethnic groups, industry sectors, and user cohorts. Within existing frameworks, it is hard to define human values and align AI systems accordingly across different directions simultaneously, such as harmlessness, helpfulness, and positiveness. To address this, we develop a novel, first-principle approach called Multi-Human-Value Alignment Palette (MAP), which navigates the alignment across multiple human values in a structured and reliable way. MAP formulates the alignment problem as an optimization task with user-defined constraints, which define human value targets. It can be efficiently solved via a primal-dual approach, which determines whether a user-defined alignment target is achievable and how to achieve it. We conduct a detailed theoretical analysis of MAP by quantifying the trade-offs between values, the sensitivity to constraints, the fundamental connection between multi-value alignment and sequential alignment, and proving that linear weighted rewards are sufficient for multi-value alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate MAP's ability to align multiple values in a principled manner while delivering strong empirical performance across various tasks."

    "title": "Value Alignment and Trust in Human-Robot Interaction: Insights from Simulation and User Study",
    "published_date": "2024-05-28",
    "abstract": "With the advent of AI technologies, humans and robots are increasingly teaming up to perform collaborative tasks. To enable smooth and effective collaboration, the topic of value alignment (operationalized herein as the degree of dynamic goal alignment within a task) between the robot and the human is gaining increasing research attention. Prior literature on value alignment makes an inherent assumption that aligning the values of the robot with that of the human benefits the team. This assumption, however, has not been empirically verified. Moreover, prior literature does not account for human's trust in the robot when analyzing human-robot value alignment. Thus, a research gap needs to be bridged by answering two questions: How does alignment of values affect trust? Is it always beneficial to align the robot's values with that of the human? We present a simulation study and a human-subject study to answer these questions. Results from the simulation study show that alignment of values is important for trust when the overall risk level of the task is high. We also present an adaptive strategy for the robot that uses Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to match the values of the robot with those of the human during interaction. Our simulations suggest that such an adaptive strategy is able to maintain trust across the full spectrum of human values. We also present results from an empirical study that validate these findings from simulation. Results indicate that real-time personalized value alignment is beneficial to trust and perceived performance by the human when the robot does not have a good prior on the human's values."

    "title": "Value Engineering for Autonomous Agents",
    "published_date": "2023-02-17",
    "abstract": "Machine Ethics (ME) is concerned with the design of Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs), i.e. autonomous agents capable of reasoning and behaving according to moral values. Previous approaches have treated values as labels associated with some actions or states of the world, rather than as integral components of agent reasoning. It is also common to disregard that a value-guided agent operates alongside other value-guided agents in an environment governed by norms, thus omitting the social dimension of AMAs. In this blue sky paper, we propose a new AMA paradigm grounded in moral and social psychology, where values are instilled into agents as context-dependent goals. These goals intricately connect values at individual levels to norms at a collective level by evaluating the outcomes most incentivized by the norms in place. We argue that this type of normative reasoning, where agents are endowed with an understanding of norms' moral implications, leads to value-awareness in autonomous agents. Additionally, this capability paves the way for agents to align the norms enforced in their societies with respect to the human values instilled in them, by complementing the value-based reasoning on norms with agreement mechanisms to help agents collectively agree on the best set of norms that suit their human values. Overall, our agent model goes beyond the treatment of values as inert labels by connecting them to normative reasoning and to the social functionalities needed to integrate value-aware agents into our modern hybrid human-computer societies.",

    "published_date": "2023-10-09",
    "abstract": "The development of ethical AI systems is currently geared toward setting objective functions that align with human objectives. However, finding such functions remains a research challenge, while in RL, setting rewards by hand is a fairly standard approach. We present a methodology for dynamic value alignment, where the values that are to be aligned with are dynamically changing, using a multiple-objective approach. We apply this approach to extend Deep $Q$-Learning to accommodate multiple objectives and evaluate this method on a simplified two-leg intersection controlled by a switching agent.Our approach dynamically accommodates the preferences of drivers on the system and achieves better overall performance across three metrics (speeds, stops, and waits) while integrating objectives that have competing or conflicting actions."

    "published_date": "2023-01-27",
    "abstract": "Large-scale AI systems that combine search and learning have reached super-human levels of performance in game-playing, but have also been shown to fail in surprising ways. The brittleness of such models limits their efficacy and trustworthiness in real-world deployments. In this work, we systematically study one such algorithm, AlphaZero, and identify two phenomena related to the nature of exploration. First, we find evidence of policy-value misalignment -- for many states, AlphaZero's policy and value predictions contradict each other, revealing a tension between accurate move-selection and value estimation in AlphaZero's objective. Further, we find inconsistency within AlphaZero's value function, which causes it to generalize poorly, despite its policy playing an optimal strategy. From these insights we derive VISA-VIS: a novel method that improves policy-value alignment and value robustness in AlphaZero. Experimentally, we show that our method reduces policy-value misalignment by up to 76%, reduces value generalization error by up to 50%, and reduces average value error by up to 55%."
