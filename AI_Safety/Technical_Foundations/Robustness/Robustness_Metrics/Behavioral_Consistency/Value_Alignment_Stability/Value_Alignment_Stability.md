### Mini Description

Metrics for evaluating how consistently systems maintain their alignment with specified values and objectives across different scenarios and decision contexts.

### Description

Value Alignment Stability focuses on measuring and ensuring the persistence of an AI system's alignment with specified values and objectives across different scenarios, decision contexts, and potential capability changes. This includes developing metrics to evaluate how robustly systems maintain their adherence to intended values when faced with novel situations, competing objectives, or changes in their own capabilities or understanding.

A central challenge is distinguishing between beneficial value refinement (where systems improve their understanding of underlying values) and harmful value drift (where systems deviate from intended values). This requires formal frameworks for quantifying alignment stability that can account for legitimate uncertainty about values while detecting problematic shifts. Researchers are developing methods to evaluate both explicit goal structures and implicit value learning, including techniques for measuring consistency in reward modeling and inverse reinforcement learning outcomes.

Emerging research directions explore the relationship between value alignment stability and system architecture, investigating how different approaches to encoding values affect their persistence. This includes work on corrigible systems that maintain alignment during self-modification, methods for detecting and preventing optimization processes that could corrupt value learning, and frameworks for evaluating the stability of learned values under distribution shift or capability gain.
