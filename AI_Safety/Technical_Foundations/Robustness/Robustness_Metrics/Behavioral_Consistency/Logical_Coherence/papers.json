    "abstract": "This study examines the notion of inconsistency in pairwise comparisons for providing an axiomatization for it. It also proposes two inconsistency indicators for pairwise comparisons. The primary motivation for the inconsistency reduction is expressed by a computer industry concept “garbage in, garbage out”. The quality of the output depends on the quality of the input.",
