### Mini Description

Methods for quantifying how system outputs change in response to input perturbations or parameter variations, including gradient-based measures and local sensitivity coefficients.

### Description

Sensitivity Analysis in AI robustness focuses on systematically studying how variations in inputs, parameters, or environmental conditions affect an AI system's outputs and behaviors. This encompasses both local methods that examine small perturbations around specific points and global approaches that analyze behavior across broader ranges of variation. The field draws heavily from classical sensitivity analysis techniques while adapting them to handle the unique challenges posed by deep learning architectures and high-dimensional spaces.

Current research emphasizes developing computationally tractable methods for large-scale systems, where traditional sensitivity measures become impractical. Key challenges include handling non-linear interactions between parameters, accounting for the hierarchical structure of neural networks, and developing methods that can capture both immediate and long-term effects of perturbations. There's particular interest in techniques that can identify critical parameters or inputs that disproportionately influence system behavior.

Emerging directions include the development of adaptive sensitivity measures that can track changes in system sensitivity during training or deployment, methods for analyzing sensitivity to structural changes in model architecture, and approaches for understanding sensitivity in the context of broader system goals and constraints. Research increasingly focuses on connecting local sensitivity measures to global robustness properties and developing theoretical frameworks that can guide the design of more robust systems.
