### Mini Description

Techniques for analyzing system sensitivity across broader ranges of variation, including variance-based methods and sampling-based approaches for understanding parameter interactions.

### Description

Global Sensitivity Methods focus on understanding how AI systems respond to large-scale variations in inputs, parameters, or environmental conditions across their entire operating space. Unlike local methods that examine infinitesimal perturbations, these approaches aim to characterize system behavior under significant changes, including interactions between multiple varying factors. This involves developing efficient sampling strategies, statistical frameworks for aggregating results, and methods for handling the computational challenges of exploring high-dimensional spaces.

Current research emphasizes the development of scalable approaches that can handle the complexity of modern AI systems while providing meaningful insights about their behavior. Key challenges include dealing with the curse of dimensionality, capturing non-linear interactions between parameters, and developing methods that remain computationally tractable for large-scale models. Researchers are particularly interested in techniques that can identify regions of stability or instability in the parameter space and characterize the boundaries between different behavioral regimes.

Emerging directions include the development of adaptive sampling methods that focus computational resources on regions of particular interest, techniques for decomposing global sensitivity into interpretable components, and approaches for connecting global sensitivity analysis to formal verification and safety guarantees. There's growing emphasis on methods that can handle the unique challenges posed by deep learning architectures, including the need to analyze sensitivity across different layers and architectural components.
