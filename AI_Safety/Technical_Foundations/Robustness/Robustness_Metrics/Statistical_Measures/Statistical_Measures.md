### Mini Description

Metrics based on statistical properties of system behavior, including variance analysis, confidence intervals, and distributional stability measures.

### Description

Statistical measures in AI robustness focus on quantifying the variability, reliability, and stability of AI system behaviors using statistical frameworks and methodologies. These measures provide formal ways to characterize how system outputs vary across different inputs, conditions, and operational contexts, enabling researchers to assess both the expected performance and the deviation from expected behavior under various scenarios.

Current research emphasizes developing measures that can capture different aspects of statistical robustness, from basic variance and moment-based metrics to more sophisticated approaches using probabilistic frameworks and information theory. Key challenges include handling the high-dimensionality of modern AI systems, developing measures that remain meaningful across different scales of operation, and creating metrics that can effectively capture rare but significant failure modes. There's particular focus on measures that can characterize the stability of learned representations and the consistency of decision boundaries in deep learning systems.

Emerging directions include the development of non-parametric statistical measures that make fewer assumptions about underlying distributions, methods for combining multiple statistical indicators into unified robustness scores, and approaches for handling dependent or correlated perturbations. Researchers are also exploring connections between statistical measures and formal verification methods, aiming to bridge the gap between probabilistic guarantees and deterministic safety properties.
