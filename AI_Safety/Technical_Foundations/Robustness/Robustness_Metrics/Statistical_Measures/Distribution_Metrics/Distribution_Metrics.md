### Mini Description

Measures that characterize the statistical properties of system outputs and internal representations, including divergence measures, entropy metrics, and distribution moment analysis.

### Description

Distribution metrics in AI robustness focus on quantitative measures for characterizing and comparing probability distributions of system behaviors, outputs, and internal representations. These metrics provide fundamental tools for assessing how well AI systems maintain consistent statistical properties across different conditions, enabling researchers to detect subtle shifts in behavior and evaluate the effectiveness of robustness interventions. Core approaches include divergence measures like KL-divergence and Wasserstein distance, as well as methods based on characteristic functions and moment matching.

Current research challenges center on developing metrics that remain computationally tractable for high-dimensional distributions while capturing meaningful differences in system behavior. This includes work on efficient approximation methods for intractable distributions, techniques for handling mixed discrete-continuous distributions common in deep learning systems, and approaches for measuring distribution differences in latent spaces. Particular attention is given to metrics that can detect potentially harmful distribution shifts while being invariant to benign variations.

Emerging directions include the development of distribution metrics specifically designed for deep learning architectures, incorporating causal structure into distribution comparisons, and creating hierarchical metrics that can capture distribution differences at multiple scales of analysis. There's also growing interest in metrics that can handle implicit distributions defined by neural networks and methods for comparing distributions of sequences or structured outputs.
