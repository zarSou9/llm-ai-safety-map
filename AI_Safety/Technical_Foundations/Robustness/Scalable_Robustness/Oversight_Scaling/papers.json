    "published_date": "2024-11-13",
    "abstract": "As AI systems become integral to critical operations across industries and services, ensuring their reliability and safety is essential. We offer a framework that integrates established reliability and resilience engineering principles into AI systems. By applying traditional metrics such as failure rate and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) along with resilience engineering and human reliability analysis, we propose an integrate framework to manage AI system performance, and prevent or efficiently recover from failures. Our work adapts classical engineering methods to AI systems and outlines a research agenda for future technical studies. We apply our framework to a real-world AI system, using system status data from platforms such as openAI, to demonstrate its practical applicability. This framework aligns with emerging global standards and regulatory frameworks, providing a methodology to enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems. Our aim is to guide policy, regulation, and the development of reliable, safe, and adaptable AI technologies capable of consistent performance in real-world environments.",

    "title": "Barriers on the EDGE: A scalable CBF architecture over EDGE for safe aerial-ground multi-agent coordination",
    "published_date": "2024-11-25",
    "abstract": "In this article, we address the problem of designing a scalable control architecture for a safe coordinated operation of a multi-agent system with aerial (UAVs) and ground robots (UGVs) in a confined task space. The proposed method uses Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to impose constraints associated with (i) collision avoidance between agents, (ii) landing of UAVs on mobile UGVs, and (iii) task space restriction. Further, to account for the rapid increase in the number of constraints for a single agent with the increasing number of agents, the proposed architecture uses a centralized-decentralized Edge cluster, where a centralized node (Watcher) activates the relevant constraints, reducing the need for high onboard processing and network complexity. The distributed nodes run the controller locally to overcome latency and network issues. The proposed Edge architecture is experimentally validated using multiple aerial and ground robots in a confined environment performing a coordinated operation.",

Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach."

    "title": "Creating Scalable AGI: the Open General Intelligence Framework",
    "published_date": "2024-11-24",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs), have led to significant progress in narrow tasks such as image classification, language translation, coding, and writing. However, these models face limitations in reliability and scalability due to their siloed architectures, which are designed to handle only one data modality (data type) at a time. This single modal approach hinders their ability to integrate the complex set of data points required for real-world challenges and problem-solving tasks like medical diagnosis, quality assurance, equipment troubleshooting, and financial decision-making. Addressing these real-world challenges requires a more capable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system. Our primary contribution is the development of the Open General Intelligence (OGI) framework, a novel systems architecture that serves as a macro design reference for AGI. The OGI framework adopts a modular approach to the design of intelligent systems, based on the premise that cognition must occur across multiple specialized modules that can seamlessly operate as a single system. OGI integrates these modules using a dynamic processing system and a fabric interconnect, enabling real-time adaptability, multi-modal integration, and scalable processing. The OGI framework consists of three key components: (1) Overall Macro Design Guidance that directs operational design and processing, (2) a Dynamic Processing System that controls routing, primary goals, instructions, and weighting, and (3) Framework Areas, a set of specialized modules that operate cohesively to form a unified cognitive system. By incorporating known principles from human cognition into AI systems, the OGI framework aims to overcome the challenges observed in today's intelligent systems, paving the way for more holistic and context-aware problem-solving capabilities.",

    "title": "Games for AI Control: Models of Safety Evaluations of AI Deployment Protocols",
    "published_date": "2024-09-12",
    "abstract": "To evaluate the safety and usefulness of deployment protocols for untrusted AIs, AI Control uses a red-teaming exercise played between a protocol designer and an adversary. This paper introduces AI-Control Games, a formal decision-making model of the red-teaming exercise as a multi-objective, partially observable, stochastic game. We also introduce methods for finding optimal protocols in AI-Control Games, by reducing them to a set of zero-sum partially observable stochastic games. We apply our formalism to model, evaluate and synthesise protocols for deploying untrusted language models as programming assistants, focusing on Trusted Monitoring protocols, which use weaker language models and limited human assistance. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our formalism by showcasing improvements over empirical studies in existing settings, evaluating protocols in new settings, and analysing how modelling assumptions affect the safety and usefulness of protocols.",

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models may carry societal transformation to an extent demanding a delicate balance between opportunity and risk. This manuscript is the first of a series of White Papers informing the development of IEEE-SA's p3995: `Standard for the Implementation of Safeguards, Controls, and Preventive Techniques for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Models', Chair: Marina Cort\\^{e}s (https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/3395/11378/). In this first horizon-scanning we identify key attention areas for standards activities in AI. We examine different principles for regulatory efforts, and review notions of accountability, privacy, data rights and mis-use. As a safeguards standard we devote significant attention to the stability of global infrastructures and consider a possible overdependence on cloud computing that may result from densely coupled AI components. We review the recent cascade-failure-like Crowdstrike event in July 2024, as an illustration of potential impacts on critical infrastructures from AI-induced incidents in the (near) future. It is the first of a set of articles intended as White Papers informing the audience on the standard development. Upcoming articles will focus on regulatory initiatives, technology evolution and the role of AI in specific domains.",

    "title": "Closing the Loop on Runtime Monitors with Fallback-Safe MPC",
    "published_date": "2023-09-15",
    "abstract": "When we rely on deep-learned models for robotic perception, we must recognize that these models may behave unreliably on inputs dissimilar from the training data, compromising the closed-loop system's safety. This raises fundamental questions on how we can assess confidence in perception systems and to what extent we can take safety-preserving actions when external environmental changes degrade our perception model's performance. Therefore, we present a framework to certify the safety of a perception-enabled system deployed in novel contexts. To do so, we leverage robust model predictive control (MPC) to control the system using the perception estimates while maintaining the feasibility of a safety-preserving fallback plan that does not rely on the perception system. In addition, we calibrate a runtime monitor using recently proposed conformal prediction techniques to certifiably detect when the perception system degrades beyond the tolerance of the MPC controller, resulting in an end-to-end safety assurance. We show that this control framework and calibration technique allows us to certify the system's safety with orders of magnitudes fewer samples than required to retrain the perception network when we deploy in a novel context on a photo-realistic aircraft taxiing simulator. Furthermore, we illustrate the safety-preserving behavior of the MPC on simulated examples of a quadrotor. We open-source our simulation platform and provide videos of our results at our project page: https://tinyurl.com/fallback-safe-mpc.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a safety-certified control framework for perception-enabled robotic systems using fallback-safe model predictive control (MPC) and conformal prediction for runtime monitoring. The approach ensures system safety even when perception model performance degrades in novel environments, requiring significantly fewer samples than retraining the perception model."

    "title": "AI Control: Improving Safety Despite Intentional Subversion",
    "published_date": "2023-12-12",
    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more powerful and are deployed more autonomously, it will be increasingly important to prevent them from causing harmful outcomes. Researchers have investigated a variety of safety techniques for this purpose, e.g. using models to review the outputs of other models, or red-teaming techniques to surface subtle failure modes. However, researchers have not evaluated whether such techniques still ensure safety if the model is itself intentionally trying to subvert them. In this paper, we develop and evaluate pipelines of safety techniques (\"protocols\") that are robust to intentional subversion. We investigate a scenario in which we want to solve a sequence of programming problems, using access to a powerful but untrusted model (in our case, GPT-4), access to a less powerful trusted model (in our case, GPT-3.5), and limited access to high-quality trusted labor. We investigate protocols that aim to never submit solutions containing backdoors, which we operationalize here as logical errors that are not caught by test cases. We investigate a range of protocols and test each against strategies that the untrusted model could use to subvert them. One protocol is what we call trusted editing. This protocol first asks GPT-4 to write code, and then asks GPT-3.5 to rate the suspiciousness of that code. If the code is below some suspiciousness threshold, it is submitted. Otherwise, GPT-3.5 edits the solution to remove parts that seem suspicious and then submits the edited code. Another protocol is untrusted monitoring. This protocol asks GPT-4 to write code, and then asks another instance of GPT-4 whether the code is backdoored, using various techniques to prevent the GPT-4 instances from colluding. These protocols improve substantially on simple baselines.",

The authors test several protocols, including \"trusted editing\" and \"untrusted monitoring,\" demonstrating significant improvements over naive approaches."
