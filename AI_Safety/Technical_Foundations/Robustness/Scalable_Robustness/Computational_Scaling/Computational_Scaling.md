### Mini Description

Approaches for implementing robustness measures that remain computationally feasible as model size and complexity increase, including efficient verification and testing methods.

### Description

Computational Scaling focuses on developing and implementing robustness measures that remain computationally tractable as AI systems grow in size and complexity. This includes both theoretical research on the computational complexity of various robustness verification methods and practical approaches to making these methods feasible for large-scale models. Key challenges include the exponential growth in computational requirements for many existing robustness techniques, the trade-off between verification completeness and computational efficiency, and the need for approaches that can handle the massive parameter spaces of modern AI systems.

Current research explores various approximation techniques, including abstract interpretation, bounded verification, and statistical sampling methods that can provide meaningful robustness guarantees while remaining computationally feasible. There is particular emphasis on developing hierarchical and compositional approaches that can leverage model structure to reduce computational complexity, as well as methods for identifying and focusing on the most critical aspects of robustness verification.

Emerging directions include the development of hardware-aware robustness techniques that can efficiently utilize modern accelerators, methods for trading off between different computational resources (memory, time, energy), and approaches for continuous verification during training rather than post-hoc analysis. Researchers are also investigating how to leverage properties of specific model architectures to make robustness verification more efficient, and developing new theoretical frameworks for understanding the fundamental computational limits of various robustness guarantees.
