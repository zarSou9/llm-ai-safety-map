### Mini Description

Approaches for maintaining robust behavior as systems become more capable or complex, including research on robustness under capability gain and computational scalability.

### Description

Scalable Robustness addresses the challenge of maintaining reliable and safe behavior as AI systems grow in complexity, capability, and deployment scope. This includes both theoretical frameworks for understanding how robustness properties scale with system capacity and practical methods for implementing robust behaviors that remain stable under capability increases. The field grapples with fundamental questions about whether current approaches to robustness will continue to work as systems become more sophisticated, or whether qualitatively different approaches are needed.

Current research focuses on several key areas: developing training procedures that promote robust behavior even as model capacity increases, creating architectures that maintain safety properties under self-improvement or capability gain, and understanding the relationship between model scale and various failure modes. This includes work on robustness to distribution shift at scale, adversarial robustness in large models, and maintaining calibration in increasingly capable systems.

Emerging challenges include the development of robust oversight mechanisms that remain effective as systems become more capable than their overseers, ensuring robustness properties compose well under recursive self-improvement, and maintaining interpretability in increasingly complex systems. Researchers are particularly concerned with potential phase transitions in system behavior as capabilities increase, and how to develop robustness guarantees that remain valid across such transitions.
