### Mini Description

Methods for ensuring systems maintain desired behaviors and safety properties as their capabilities increase, including research on phase transitions and robustness under self-improvement.

### Description

Capability Robustness focuses on ensuring AI systems maintain their safety properties and intended behaviors as they become more capable, either through direct improvements or through self-modification. This includes understanding how different safety properties scale with increasing model capacity, identifying potential phase transitions in system behavior, and developing frameworks for maintaining control and alignment across capability jumps. The field grapples with fundamental questions about whether current safety approaches will remain effective as systems become more sophisticated.

Current research explores several key challenges: predicting and controlling behavioral changes during capability increases, ensuring safety constraints remain binding as systems become more capable of finding creative solutions or exploits, and maintaining alignment with original objectives under self-improvement. This includes work on constrained optimization that remains effective under capability gain, methods for detecting and managing emergent capabilities, and techniques for preserving safety properties during system updates or architecture changes.

A particular focus is on understanding and managing discontinuous changes in system behavior - points where quantitative improvements in capabilities lead to qualitatively different behaviors or failure modes. This includes research on detecting and characterizing such transitions, developing early warning systems for emerging capabilities, and creating architectures that maintain stable and predictable behavior even as underlying capabilities increase. The field emphasizes the importance of theoretical frameworks that can reason about systems more capable than their designers.
