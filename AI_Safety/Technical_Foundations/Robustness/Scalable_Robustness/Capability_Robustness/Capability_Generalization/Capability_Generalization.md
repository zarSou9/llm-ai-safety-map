### Mini Description

Research on how safety properties and alignment techniques generalize across different capability levels, including theoretical frameworks for reasoning about systems more capable than their designers.

### Description

Capability Generalization investigates how safety properties, alignment techniques, and control mechanisms extend to AI systems that exceed the capabilities of their designers or training environments. This includes developing theoretical frameworks for reasoning about superintelligent systems, understanding the limits of current safety approaches, and creating methods that reliably scale beyond human-level capabilities. The field grapples with fundamental questions about whether alignment solutions that work for current AI systems will continue to work for more advanced ones.

Current research focuses on identifying invariant properties that remain stable across capability levels, developing formal models of capability transfer, and creating training approaches that promote reliable generalization of safety constraints. This includes work on abstract reasoning about superintelligent systems, formal frameworks for reasoning about systems with unknown capabilities, and methods for ensuring that safety properties remain binding even when systems develop novel problem-solving approaches.

A key challenge is the development of proofs and guarantees that remain valid regardless of a system's capability level. This involves research on capability-robust formal specifications, methods for reasoning about systems that can find solutions humans cannot verify, and approaches for maintaining control over systems that may develop fundamentally new forms of intelligence or problem-solving strategies. The field emphasizes the importance of solutions that don't rely on human oversight or verification at deployment time.
