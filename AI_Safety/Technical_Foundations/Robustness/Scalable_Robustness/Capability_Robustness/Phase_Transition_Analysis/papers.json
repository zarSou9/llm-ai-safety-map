    "title": "Integrating Graceful Degradation and Recovery Through Requirement-Driven Adaptation",
    "published_date": "2024-01-18",
    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to environmental uncertainties such as adverse operating conditions, malicious attacks, and hardware degradation. These uncertainties may lead to failures that put the system in a sub-optimal or unsafe state. Systems that are resilient to such uncertainties rely on two types of operations: (1) graceful degradation, for ensuring that the system maintains an acceptable level of safety during unexpected environmental conditions and (2) recovery, to facilitate the resumption of normal system functions. Typically, mechanisms for degradation and recovery are developed independently from each other, and later integrated into a system, requiring the designer to develop an additional, ad-hoc logic for activating and coordinating between the two operations. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptation approach for improving system resiliency through automated triggering and coordination of graceful degradation and recovery. The key idea behind our approach is to treat degradation and recovery as requirement-driven adaptation tasks: Degradation can be thought of as temporarily weakening original (i.e., ideal) system requirements to be achieved by the system, and recovery as strengthening the weakened requirements when the environment returns within an expected operating boundary. Furthermore, by treating weakening and strengthening as dual operations, we argue that a single requirement-based adaptation method is sufficient to enable coordination between degradation and recovery. Given system requirements specified in signal temporal logic (STL), we propose a run-time adaptation framework that performs degradation and recovery in response to environmental changes. We describe a prototype implementation of our framework and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach using a case study in unmanned underwater vehicles."

    "title": "Robust Task Scheduling for Heterogeneous Robot Teams Under Capability Uncertainty",
    "published_date": "2021-06-23",
    "abstract": "This article develops a stochastic programming framework for multiagent systems, where task decomposition, assignment, and scheduling problems are simultaneously optimized. The framework can be applied to heterogeneous mobile robot teams with distributed subtasks. Examples include pandemic robotic service coordination, explore and rescue, and delivery systems with heterogeneous vehicles. Owing to their inherent flexibility and robustness, multiagent systems are applied in a growing range of real-world problems that involve heterogeneous tasks and uncertain information. Most previous works assume one fixed way to decompose a task into roles that can later be assigned to the agents. This assumption is not valid for a complex task where the roles can vary and multiple decomposition structures exist. Meanwhile, it is unclear how uncertainties in task requirements and agent capabilities can be systematically quantified and optimized under a multiagent system setting. A representation for complex tasks is proposed: agent capabilities are represented as a vector of random distributions, and task requirements are verified by a generalizable binary function. The conditional value at risk is chosen as a metric in the objective function to generate robust plans. An efficient algorithm is described to solve the model, and the whole framework is evaluated in two different practical test cases: capture-the-flag and robotic service coordination during a pandemic (e.g., COVID-19). Results demonstrate that the framework is generalizable, is scalable up to 140 agents and 40 tasks for the example test cases, and provides low-cost plans that ensure a high probability of success.",

    "title": "Safety from in-the-loop reachability for cyber-physical systems",
    "abstract": "We demonstrate a methodology for achieving safe autonomy that relies on computing reachable sets at runtime. Given a system subject to disturbances controlled by an unverified and potentially faulty controller, this methodology computes at each time the reachable set of the system under a backup control law to ensure the system is within reach of a known a priori safe region. Control barrier functions are then used in conjunction with the reachable set to adjust potentially unsafe control actions that would otherwise move the system beyond reach of this safe set. This approach faces several computational challenges: reachable sets for the dynamics must be computed at runtime; sensitivity of the reachable set to initial conditions is required for the control barrier optimization formulation; and the presence of disturbances introduces a large number of constraints in the resulting optimization. The proposed methodology leverages the theory of mixed monotone systems to address these challenges, and the main contribution of this paper is an application of this methodology to a ten dimensional dual planar multirotor system that is implemented on embedded hardware with a controller update rate up to 100Hz.",

    "published_date": "2021-03-04",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we extend a framework that we developed earlier for coordination of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at a signal-free intersection to incorporate uncertainty. Using the possibly noisy observations of actual time trajectories and leveraging Gaussian process regression, we learn the bounded confidence intervals for deviations from the nominal trajectories of CAVs online. Incorporating these confidence intervals, we reformulate the trajectory planning as a robust coordination problem, the solution of which guarantees that constraints in the system are satisfied in the presence of bounded deviations from the nominal trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our extended framework through a numerical simulation.",

    "title": "Effect of rate of change of parameter on early warning signals for critical transitions.",
    "published_date": "2021-01-01",
    "abstract": "Many dynamical systems exhibit abrupt transitions or tipping as the control parameter is varied. In scenarios where the parameter is varied continuously, the rate of change of the control parameter greatly affects the performance of early warning signals (EWS) for such critical transitions. We study the impact of variation of the control parameter with a finite rate on the performance of EWS for critical transitions in a thermoacoustic system (a horizontal Rijke tube) exhibiting subcritical Hopf bifurcation. There is a growing interest in developing early warning signals for tipping in real systems. First, we explore the efficacy of early warning signals based on critical slowing down and fractal characteristics. From this study, lag-1 autocorrelation (AC) and Hurst exponent (H) are found to be good measures to predict the transition well before the tipping point. The warning time, obtained using AC and H, reduces with an increase in the rate of change of the control parameter following an inverse power law relation. Hence, for very fast rates, the warning time may be too short to perform any control action. Furthermore, we report the observation of a hyperexponential scaling relation between the AC and the variance of fluctuations during such a dynamic Hopf bifurcation. We construct a theoretical model for noisy Hopf bifurcation wherein the control parameter is continuously varied at different rates to study the effect of rate of change of the parameter on EWS. Similar results, including the hyperexponential scaling, are observed in the model as well.",
