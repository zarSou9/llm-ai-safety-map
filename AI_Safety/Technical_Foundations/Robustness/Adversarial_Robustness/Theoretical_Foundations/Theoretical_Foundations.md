### Mini Description

Mathematical frameworks for understanding the existence, properties, and limitations of adversarial examples and robust learning.

### Description

Theoretical foundations of adversarial robustness focus on developing mathematical frameworks to understand the fundamental nature of adversarial examples, characterize model vulnerabilities, and establish formal bounds on achievable robustness. This includes analyzing the geometry of decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces, studying the relationship between model complexity and robustness, and developing theoretical guarantees for various defense mechanisms. Key areas include the study of optimal transport theory, statistical learning theory, and geometric deep learning as they relate to adversarial phenomena.

Current research examines trade-offs between standard accuracy and adversarial robustness, establishing impossibility results and necessary conditions for robust learning. Researchers investigate the connection between adversarial vulnerability and features learned by neural networks, exploring whether certain architectures or training paradigms can lead to inherently more robust representations. This work has revealed fundamental limitations in current approaches and sparked investigation into alternative formulations of the robustness problem.

Emerging directions include the study of instance-dependent robustness bounds, connections to concentration of measure phenomena, and information-theoretic perspectives on adversarial examples. Researchers are developing new mathematical tools to analyze the landscape of adversarial perturbations and understand how model architecture and training procedures influence robustness properties. This theoretical work provides crucial insights for developing more effective defenses and understanding fundamental limitations in achievable robustness.
