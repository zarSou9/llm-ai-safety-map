### Mini Description

Study of decision boundaries, manifold structure, and geometric properties of neural networks that influence adversarial vulnerability.

### Description

Geometric analysis in adversarial robustness examines how the spatial arrangement of decision boundaries, data manifolds, and feature representations in neural networks influences their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This includes studying the curvature and local geometry of decision boundaries, analyzing how different architectural choices affect the geometric properties of learned representations, and understanding how adversarial perturbations interact with the underlying data manifold.

A key focus is characterizing the relationship between geometric properties and robustness. Research has shown that flatter decision boundaries often correlate with increased robustness, while highly curved or irregular boundaries tend to create more opportunities for adversarial exploitation. Studies also examine how the distance between class manifolds, the concentration of features in high-dimensional spaces, and the alignment between model decision boundaries and human perceptual boundaries affect adversarial vulnerability.

Emerging research directions include investigating the role of geometric margin in determining robustness, understanding how data augmentation and regularization techniques influence geometric properties, and developing metrics to quantify geometric complexity of neural networks. There's particular interest in how geometric properties scale with network depth and width, and how architectural choices like skip connections or attention mechanisms affect the geometry of learned representations.
