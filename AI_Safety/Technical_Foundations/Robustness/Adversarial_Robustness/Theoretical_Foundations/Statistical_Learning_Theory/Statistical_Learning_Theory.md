### Mini Description

Analysis of generalization bounds, sample complexity, and fundamental limits of robust learning from a statistical perspective.

### Description

Statistical Learning Theory in the context of adversarial robustness examines the fundamental principles and limitations of learning robust classifiers from finite data. This includes analyzing sample complexity requirements for robust learning, establishing generalization bounds that account for adversarial perturbations, and understanding the statistical cost of achieving robustness compared to standard learning. The theory provides crucial insights into why modern neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples and what fundamental barriers exist to achieving robustness.

Current research focuses on characterizing the sample complexity gap between standard and robust learning, showing that achieving adversarial robustness often requires significantly more training data than standard accuracy. Researchers are developing novel concentration inequalities and complexity measures that better capture the challenges of robust learning, including analysis of how data distribution properties affect achievable robustness. This work has revealed important connections between robust generalization and properties like model capacity, data dimensionality, and margin distributions.

Emerging directions explore instance-dependent robustness bounds, analyzing how local properties of the data distribution affect achievable robustness guarantees. There's increasing focus on understanding the role of data augmentation and consistency training in robust learning, as well as developing distribution-dependent complexity measures that can provide tighter bounds. These theoretical investigations help guide the development of more efficient robust learning algorithms and provide insights into fundamental accuracy-robustness trade-offs.
