    "abstract": "Over the past decade, deep learning has revolutionized conventional tasks that rely on hand-craft feature extraction with its strong feature learning capability, leading to substantial enhancements in traditional tasks. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to adversarial examples crafted by malicious tiny noise, which is imperceptible to human observers but can make DNNs output the wrong result. Existing adversarial attacks can be categorized into digital and physical adversarial attacks. The former is designed to pursue strong attack performance in lab environments while hardly remaining effective when applied to the physical world. In contrast, the latter focus on developing physical deployable attacks, thus exhibiting more robustness in complex physical environmental conditions. Recently, with the increasing deployment of the DNN-based system in the real world, strengthening the robustness of these systems is an emergency, while exploring physical adversarial attacks exhaustively is the precondition. To this end, this paper reviews the evolution of physical adversarial attacks against DNN-based computer vision tasks, expecting to provide beneficial information for developing stronger physical adversarial attacks. Specifically, we first proposed a taxonomy to categorize the current physical adversarial attacks and grouped them. Then, we discuss the existing physical attacks and focus on the technique for improving the robustness of physical attacks under complex physical environmental conditions. Finally, we discuss the issues of the current physical adversarial attacks to be solved and give promising directions.",

    "title": "Towards an End-to-End (E2E) Adversarial Learning and Application in the Physical World",
    "published_date": "2025-01-14",
    "abstract": "The traditional learning process of patch-based adversarial attacks, conducted in the digital domain and then applied in the physical domain (e.g., via printed stickers), may suffer from reduced performance due to adversarial patches' limited transferability from the digital domain to the physical domain. Given that previous studies have considered using projectors to apply adversarial attacks, we raise the following question: can adversarial learning (i.e., patch generation) be performed entirely in the physical domain with a projector? In this work, we propose the Physical-domain Adversarial Patch Learning Augmentation (PAPLA) framework, a novel end-to-end (E2E) framework that converts adversarial learning from the digital domain to the physical domain using a projector. We evaluate PAPLA across multiple scenarios, including controlled laboratory settings and realistic outdoor environments, demonstrating its ability to ensure attack success compared to conventional digital learning-physical application (DL-PA) methods. We also analyze the impact of environmental factors, such as projection surface color, projector strength, ambient light, distance, and angle of the target object relative to the camera, on the effectiveness of projected patches. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the attack against a parked car and a stop sign in a real-world outdoor environment. Our results show that under specific conditions, E2E adversarial learning in the physical domain eliminates the transferability issue and ensures evasion by object detectors. Finally, we provide insights into the challenges and opportunities of applying adversarial learning in the physical domain and explain where such an approach is more effective than using a sticker."

    "title": "Revisiting Physical-World Adversarial Attack on Traffic Sign Recognition: A Commercial Systems Perspective",
    "published_date": "2024-09-15",
    "abstract": "Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) is crucial for safe and correct driving automation. Recent works revealed a general vulnerability of TSR models to physical-world adversarial attacks, which can be low-cost, highly deployable, and capable of causing severe attack effects such as hiding a critical traffic sign or spoofing a fake one. However, so far existing works generally only considered evaluating the attack effects on academic TSR models, leaving the impacts of such attacks on real-world commercial TSR systems largely unclear. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale measurement of physical-world adversarial attacks against commercial TSR systems. Our testing results reveal that it is possible for existing attack works from academia to have highly reliable (100\\%) attack success against certain commercial TSR system functionality, but such attack capabilities are not generalizable, leading to much lower-than-expected attack success rates overall. We find that one potential major factor is a spatial memorization design that commonly exists in today's commercial TSR systems. We design new attack success metrics that can mathematically model the impacts of such design on the TSR system-level attack success, and use them to revisit existing attacks. Through these efforts, we uncover 7 novel observations, some of which directly challenge the observations or claims in prior works due to the introduction of the new metrics."

    "title": "ITPatch: An Invisible and Triggered Physical Adversarial Patch against Traffic Sign Recognition",
    "published_date": "2024-09-19",
    "abstract": "Physical adversarial patches have emerged as a key adversarial attack to cause misclassification of traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems in the real world. However, existing adversarial patches have poor stealthiness and attack all vehicles indiscriminately once deployed. In this paper, we introduce an invisible and triggered physical adversarial patch (ITPatch) with a novel attack vector, i.e., fluorescent ink, to advance the state-of-the-art. It applies carefully designed fluorescent perturbations to a target sign, an attacker can later trigger a fluorescent effect using invisible ultraviolet light, causing the TSR system to misclassify the sign and potentially resulting in traffic accidents. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of ITPatch, which shows a success rate of 98.31% in low-light conditions. Furthermore, our attack successfully bypasses five popular defenses and achieves a success rate of 96.72%."

    "title": "Imperceptible Adversarial Examples in the Physical World",
    "published_date": "2024-11-25",
    "abstract": "Adversarial examples in the digital domain against deep learning-based computer vision models allow for perturbations that are imperceptible to human eyes. However, producing similar adversarial examples in the physical world has been difficult due to the non-differentiable image distortion functions in visual sensing systems. The existing algorithms for generating physically realizable adversarial examples often loosen their definition of adversarial examples by allowing unbounded perturbations, resulting in obvious or even strange visual patterns. In this work, we make adversarial examples imperceptible in the physical world using a straight-through estimator (STE, a.k.a. BPDA). We employ STE to overcome the non-differentiability -- applying exact, non-differentiable distortions in the forward pass of the backpropagation step, and using the identity function in the backward pass. Our differentiable rendering extension to STE also enables imperceptible adversarial patches in the physical world. Using printout photos, and experiments in the CARLA simulator, we show that STE enables fast generation of $\\ell_\\infty$ bounded adversarial examples despite the non-differentiable distortions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating imperceptible adversarial examples bounded by small $\\ell_\\infty$ norms in the physical world that force zero classification accuracy in the global perturbation threat model and cause near-zero ($4.22\\%$) AP50 in object detection in the patch perturbation threat model. We urge the community to re-evaluate the threat of adversarial examples in the physical world."
