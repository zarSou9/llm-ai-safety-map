### Mini Description

Investigation of vulnerabilities and defenses specific to various sensing modalities, including cameras, lidar, radar, and other sensors used in AI systems.

### Description

Sensor security in AI systems focuses on understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities in the interface between physical sensing devices and AI processing pipelines. This encompasses both direct attacks on sensor hardware (like blinding cameras or jamming radar signals) and more subtle manipulations that exploit the specific characteristics of different sensing modalities to fool downstream AI systems. The field requires deep understanding of both the physical principles underlying various sensing technologies and the ways their outputs are processed and interpreted by AI models.

A key challenge is the diversity of attack surfaces and failure modes across different sensor types. For example, optical sensors are vulnerable to specialized light patterns or carefully positioned objects, while acoustic sensors can be fooled by specifically crafted sound waves that exploit their sampling and processing characteristics. The interaction between multiple sensor modalities introduces additional complexities, as attacks might need to fool multiple sensing channels simultaneously or could exploit inconsistencies between different sensor inputs.

Current research emphasizes the development of robust sensor fusion techniques, methods for detecting and filtering malicious inputs, and architectural approaches that maintain system functionality even when individual sensors are compromised. Emerging directions include the study of quantum sensors and their unique security properties, the development of self-calibrating and self-validating sensor networks, and the investigation of bio-inspired sensing approaches that might offer inherent robustness to certain types of attacks.
