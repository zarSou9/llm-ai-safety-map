    "title": "Safety-Assured Design and Adaptation of Learning-Enabled Autonomous Systems",
    "abstract": "Future autonomous systems will employ sophisticated machine learning techniques for the sensing and perception of the surroundings and the making corresponding decisions for planning, control, and other actions. They often operate in highly dynamic, uncertain and challenging environment, and need to meet stringent timing, resource, and mission requirements. In particular, it is critical and yet very challenging to ensure the safety of these autonomous systems, given the uncertainties of the system inputs, the constant disturbances on the system operations, and the lack of analyzability for many machine learning methods (particularly those based on neural networks). In this paper, we will discuss some of these challenges, and present our work in developing automated, quantitative, and formalized methods and tools for ensuring the safety of autonomous systems in their design and during their runtime adaptation. We argue that it is essential to take a holistic approach in addressing system safety and other safety-related properties, vertically across the functional, software, and hardware layers, and horizontally across the autonomy pipeline of sensing, perception, planning, and control modules. This approach could be further extended from a single autonomous system to a multi-agent system where multiple autonomous agents perform tasks in a collaborative manner. We will use connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as the main application domain to illustrate the importance of such holistic approach and show our initial efforts in this direction.",

    "title": "Stealthy Attacks against Robotic Vehicles Protected by Control-based Intrusion Detection Techniques",
    "abstract": "Robotic vehicles (RV) are increasing in adoption in many industrial sectors. RVs use auto-pilot software for perception and navigation and rely on sensors and actuators for operating autonomously in the physical world. Control algorithms have been used in RVs to minimize the effects of noisy sensors, prevent faulty actuator output, and, recently, to detect attacks against RVs. In this article, we demonstrate the vulnerabilities in control-based intrusion detection techniques and propose three kinds of stealthy attacks that evade detection and disrupt RV missions. We also propose automated algorithms for performing the attacks without requiring the attacker to expend significant effort or to know specific details of the RV, thus making the attacks applicable to a wide range of RVs. We demonstrate the attacks on eight RV systems including three real vehicles in the presence of an Intrusion Detection System using control-based techniques to monitor RV's runtime behavior and detect attacks. We find that the control-based techniques are incapable of detecting our stealthy attacks and that the attacks can have significant adverse impact on the RV's mission (e.g., deviate it significantly from its target, or cause it to crash).",

    "title": "Safety from in-the-loop reachability for cyber-physical systems",
    "abstract": "We demonstrate a methodology for achieving safe autonomy that relies on computing reachable sets at runtime. Given a system subject to disturbances controlled by an unverified and potentially faulty controller, this methodology computes at each time the reachable set of the system under a backup control law to ensure the system is within reach of a known a priori safe region. Control barrier functions are then used in conjunction with the reachable set to adjust potentially unsafe control actions that would otherwise move the system beyond reach of this safe set. This approach faces several computational challenges: reachable sets for the dynamics must be computed at runtime; sensitivity of the reachable set to initial conditions is required for the control barrier optimization formulation; and the presence of disturbances introduces a large number of constraints in the resulting optimization. The proposed methodology leverages the theory of mixed monotone systems to address these challenges, and the main contribution of this paper is an application of this methodology to a ten dimensional dual planar multirotor system that is implemented on embedded hardware with a controller update rate up to 100Hz.",
