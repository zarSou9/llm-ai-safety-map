### Mini Description

Methods for defending against and understanding intentionally crafted inputs designed to fool or manipulate AI systems, including both empirical defenses and theoretical guarantees.

### Description

Adversarial robustness addresses the vulnerability of AI systems to carefully crafted inputs designed to cause incorrect or harmful behaviors. These adversarial examples exploit the fundamental properties of machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, by introducing small perturbations that are often imperceptible to humans but can dramatically affect model outputs. The field encompasses both the development of attack methods to identify vulnerabilities and defensive techniques to build more robust systems.

Current research approaches span theoretical investigations into the existence and properties of adversarial examples, empirical methods for generating and defending against attacks, and formal verification techniques for guaranteeing robustness bounds. Key challenges include the apparent trade-off between standard accuracy and adversarial robustness, the computational cost of robust training methods, and the difficulty of achieving certified robustness for complex models. Researchers are also exploring connections between adversarial robustness and other desirable properties like interpretability and out-of-distribution generalization.

Emerging directions focus on understanding adversarial vulnerabilities in more complex settings, including real-world physical attacks, semantic adversarial examples that preserve meaning while changing surface features, and adaptive attacks that can bypass specific defenses. There's increasing attention to robustness against multiple types of attacks simultaneously and the development of efficiently scalable defenses for large models. The field also considers broader questions about the relationship between human and machine perception, and whether complete adversarial robustness is achievable or even desirable.
