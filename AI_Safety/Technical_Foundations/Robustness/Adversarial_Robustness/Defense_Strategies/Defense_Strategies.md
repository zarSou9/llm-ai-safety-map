### Mini Description

Methods for building models resistant to adversarial attacks, including adversarial training, preprocessing defenses, and architectural modifications.

### Description

Defense strategies against adversarial attacks encompass a diverse set of approaches aimed at making AI systems more resistant to malicious inputs. These methods range from modifying training procedures and model architectures to implementing input preprocessing and detection mechanisms. The field has evolved from simple gradient masking techniques to more sophisticated approaches that aim to provide meaningful robustness guarantees.

Current research focuses on addressing key challenges including the trade-off between robustness and accuracy, computational efficiency of defensive methods, and generalization across different types of attacks. Adversarial training, while currently the most successful approach, faces scalability issues with model size and training time. This has motivated research into alternative approaches like randomized smoothing, input transformation, and ensemble methods that can provide different robustness-efficiency trade-offs.

Emerging directions in defense strategies emphasize the development of principled approaches that can provide theoretical guarantees while remaining practical for real-world deployment. There's increasing focus on defenses that can handle multiple threat models simultaneously and methods that maintain robustness under distribution shift. Researchers are also exploring the connection between defensive techniques and other desirable properties like interpretability and out-of-distribution generalization.
