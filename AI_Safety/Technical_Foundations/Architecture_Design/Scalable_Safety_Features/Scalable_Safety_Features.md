### Mini Description

Design principles and mechanisms that maintain safety properties as system capabilities increase, including approaches to safe self-modification and recursive improvement.

### Description

Scalable Safety Features focuses on designing AI architectures that maintain their safety properties even as systems become more capable and complex. This involves developing mechanisms that preserve alignment, robustness, and controllability across capability jumps, while preventing systems from circumventing or corrupting their own safety measures. Key challenges include ensuring that safety constraints remain binding even as systems develop improved optimization capabilities, and maintaining meaningful human oversight as system complexity grows.

Current research explores various approaches to scalable safety, including formal frameworks for safe self-modification, mechanisms for maintaining value stability during capability improvements, and techniques for recursive reward modeling. Particular attention is given to the theoretical foundations of systems that can safely reason about and modify their own architecture, while preserving their original safety constraints and alignment properties.

A critical area of investigation is the development of safety measures that are 'natural' rather than 'bolted-on' - features that become more robust rather than more brittle as capabilities scale. This includes work on foundational goals that remain coherent under reflection, mechanisms for uncertainty handling that scale with system sophistication, and architectures that maintain interpretability even as internal complexity increases.
