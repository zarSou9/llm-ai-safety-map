    "published_date": "2024-08-23",
    "abstract": "AI Safety is an emerging area of critical importance to the safe adoption and deployment of AI systems. With the rapid proliferation of AI and especially with the recent advancement of Generative AI (or GAI), the technology ecosystem behind the design, development, adoption, and deployment of AI systems has drastically changed, broadening the scope of AI Safety to address impacts on public safety and national security. In this paper, we propose a novel architectural framework for understanding and analyzing AI Safety; defining its characteristics from three perspectives: Trustworthy AI, Responsible AI, and Safe AI. We provide an extensive review of current research and advancements in AI safety from these perspectives, highlighting their key challenges and mitigation approaches. Through examples from state-of-the-art technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), we present innovative mechanism, methodologies, and techniques for designing and testing AI safety. Our goal is to promote advancement in AI safety research, and ultimately enhance people's trust in digital transformation.",

    "title": "Architecting Safer Autonomous Aviation Systems",
    "published_date": "2023-01-09",
    "abstract": "The aviation literature gives relatively little guidance to practitioners about the specifics of architecting systems for safety, particularly the impact of architecture on allocating safety requirements, or the relative ease of system assurance resulting from system or subsystem level architectural choices. As an exemplar, this paper considers common architectural patterns used within traditional aviation systems and explores their safety and safety assurance implications when applied in the context of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning ( ML ) based functionality. Considering safety as an architectural property, we discuss both the allocation of safety requirements and the architectural trade-offs involved early in the design lifecycle. This approach could be extended to other assured properties, similar to safety, such as security. We conclude with a discussion of the safety considerations that emerge in the context of candidate architectural patterns that have been proposed in the recent literature for enabling autonomy capabilities by integrating AI and ML. A recommendation is made for the generation of a property-driven architectural pattern catalogue.",

    "published_date": "2023-04-13",
    "abstract": "The release of ChatGPT, Gemini, and other large language model has drawn huge interests on foundations models. There is a broad consensus that foundations models will be the fundamental building blocks for future AI systems. However, there is a lack of systematic guidance on the architecture design. Particularly, the the rapidly growing capabilities of foundations models can eventually absorb other components of AI systems, posing challenges of moving boundary and interface evolution in architecture design. Furthermore, incorporating foundations models into AI systems raises significant concerns about responsible and safe AI due to their opaque nature and rapidly advancing intelligence. To address these challenges, the paper first presents an architecture evolution of AI systems in the era of foundation models, transitioning from\"foundation-model-as-a-connector\"to\"foundation-model-as-a-monolithic architecture\". The paper then identifies key design decisions and proposes a pattern-oriented reference architecture for designing responsible foundation-model-based systems. The patterns can enable the potential of foundation models while ensuring associated risks.",

    "title": "A Compositional Approach to Creating Architecture Frameworks with an Application to Distributed AI Systems",
    "published_date": "2022-12-27",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms finds more and more its way into complex distributed systems. For instance, it is used locally, as part of a sensor system, on the edge for low-latency high-performance inference, or in the cloud, e.g. for data mining. Modern complex systems, such as connected vehicles, are often part of an Internet of Things (IoT). To manage complexity, architectures are described with architecture frameworks, which are composed of a number of architectural views connected through correspondence rules. Despite some attempts, the definition of a mathematical foundation for architecture frameworks that are suitable for the development of distributed AI systems still requires investigation and study. In this paper, we propose to extend the state of the art on architecture framework by providing a mathematical model for system architectures, which is scalable and supports co-evolution of different aspects for example of an AI system. Based on Design Science Research, this study starts by identifying the challenges with architectural frameworks. Then, we derive from the identified challenges four rules and we formulate them by exploiting concepts from category theory. We show how compositional thinking can provide rules for the creation and management of architectural frameworks for complex systems, for example distributed systems with AI. The aim of the paper is not to provide viewpoints or architecture models specific to AI systems, but instead to provide guidelines based on a mathematical formulation on how a consistent framework can be built up with existing, or newly created, viewpoints. To put in practice and test the approach, the identified and formulated rules are applied to derive an architectural framework for the EU Horizon 2020 project ``Very efficient deep learning in the IoT\"(VEDLIoT) in the form of a case study.",

    "published_date": "2022-03-02",
    "abstract": "Although AI has significant potential to transform society, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions responsibly. Many ethical regulations, principles, and guidelines for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, these principles are high-level and difficult to put into practice. In the meantime much effort has been put into responsible AI from the algorithm perspective, but they are limited to a small subset of ethical principles amenable to mathematical analysis. Responsible AI issues go beyond data and algorithms and are often at the system-level crosscutting many system components and the entire software engineering lifecycle. Based on the result of a systematic literature review, this paper identifies one missing element as the system-level guidance - how to design the architecture of responsible AI systems. We present a summary of design patterns that can be embedded into the AI systems as product features to contribute to responsible-AI-by-design.",

    "published_date": "2022-12-28",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been developed rapidly, and AI-based systems have been widely used in various application domains with opportunities and challenges. However, little is known about the architecture decisions made in AI-based systems development, which has a substantial impact on the success and sustainability of these systems. To this end, we conducted an empirical study by collecting and analyzing the data from Stack Overflow (SO) and GitHub. More specifically, we searched on SO with six sets of keywords and explored 32 AI-based projects on GitHub, and finally we collected 174 posts and 128 GitHub issues related to architecture decisions. The results show that in AI-based systems development (1) architecture decisions are expressed in six linguistic patterns, among which Solution Proposal and Information Giving are most frequently used, (2) Technology Decision, Component Decision, and Data Decision are the main types of architecture decisions made, (3) Game is the most common application domain among the eighteen application domains identified, (4) the dominant quality attribute considered in architecture decision-making is Performance, and (5) the main limitations and challenges encountered by practitioners in making architecture decisions are Design Issues and Data Issues. Our results suggest that the limitations and challenges when making architecture decisions in AI-based systems development are highly specific to the characteristics of AI-based systems and are mainly of technical nature, which need to be properly confronted.",

    "published_date": "2022-11-06",
    "abstract": "The pervasive application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is transforming many industries and aspects of the human experience. One very important industry trend is the move to convert existing human dwellings to smart buildings, and to create new smart buildings. Smart buildings aim to mitigate climate change by reducing energy consumption and associated carbon emissions. To accomplish this, they leverage artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning algorithms to learn and optimize system performance. These fields of research are currently very rapidly evolving and advancing, but there has been very little guidance to help engineers and architects working on smart buildings apply artificial intelligence algorithms and technologies in a systematic and effective manner. In this paper we present B-SMART: the first reference architecture for autonomic smart buildings. B-SMART facilitates the application of artificial intelligence techniques and technologies to smart buildings by decoupling conceptually distinct layers of functionality and organizing them into an autonomic control loop. We also present a case study illustrating how B-SMART can be applied to accelerate the introduction of artificial intelligence into an existing smart building.",

In this paper, we present Neo, a software-hardware co-designed system for high-performance distributed training of large-scale DLRMs. Neo employs a novel 4D parallelism strategy that combines table-wise, row-wise, column-wise, and data parallelism for training massive embedding operators in DLRMs. In addition, Neo enables extremely high-performance and memory-efficient embedding computations using a variety of critical systems optimizations, including hybrid kernel fusion, software-managed caching, and quality-preserving compression. Finally, Neo is paired with ZionEX, a new hardware platform co-designed with Neo's 4D parallelism for optimizing communications for large-scale DLRM training. Our evaluation on 128 GPUs using 16 ZionEX nodes shows that Neo outperforms existing systems by up to 40× for training 12-trillion-parameter DLRM models deployed in production.",

    "abstract": "AI ethics principles and guidelines are typically high-level and do not provide concrete guidance on how to develop responsible AI systems. To address this shortcoming, we perform an empirical study involving interviews with 21 scientists and engineers to understand the practitioners' views on AI ethics principles and their implementation. Our major findings are: (1) the current practice is often a done-once-and-forget type of ethical risk assessment at a particular development step, which is not sufficient for highly uncertain and continual learning AI systems; (2) ethical requirements are either omitted or mostly stated as high-level objectives, and not specified explicitly in verifiable way as system outputs or outcomes; (3) although ethical requirements have the characteristics of cross-cutting quality and non-functional requirements amenable to architecture and design analysis, system-level architecture and design are under-explored; (4) there is a strong desire for continuously monitoring and validating AI systems post deployment for ethical requirements but current operation practices provide limited guidance. To address these findings, we suggest a preliminary list of patterns to provide operationalised guidance for developing responsible AI systems.",
