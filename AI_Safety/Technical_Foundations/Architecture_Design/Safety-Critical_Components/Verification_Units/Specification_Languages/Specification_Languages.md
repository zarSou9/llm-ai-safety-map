### Mini Description

Formal languages and frameworks for expressing safety properties and behavioral constraints in a way that enables automated verification and runtime checking.

### Description

Specification Languages in AI safety focus on formal methods for precisely expressing safety properties, behavioral constraints, and system requirements in a way that enables automated verification and runtime monitoring. These languages bridge the gap between human-interpretable safety requirements and machine-verifiable specifications, providing rigorous frameworks for defining what constitutes safe behavior in AI systems. They must balance expressiveness with tractability, allowing for both rich specification of complex properties and efficient automated reasoning.

Current research explores various specification paradigms, from temporal logics that can express time-dependent properties to probabilistic specifications that handle uncertainty. Key challenges include developing languages that can capture fuzzy or context-dependent human values, express complex emergent behaviors, and maintain clarity at scale. Researchers are particularly focused on specifications that can adapt to changing environments and system capabilities while preserving core safety properties.

A major area of investigation is the development of compositional specification languages that enable modular verification and the combination of different types of safety properties. This includes work on specification refinement, abstraction mechanisms that preserve verifiability, and frameworks for expressing both local component-level properties and global system-level guarantees. Emphasis is placed on creating languages that support automated translation between different levels of abstraction while maintaining formal rigor.
