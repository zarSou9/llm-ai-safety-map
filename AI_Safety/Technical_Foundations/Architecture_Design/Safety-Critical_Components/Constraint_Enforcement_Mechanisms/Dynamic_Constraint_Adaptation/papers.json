    "title": "Concurrent Learning of Policy and Unknown Safety Constraints in Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2024-02-24",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has revolutionized decision-making across a wide range of domains over the past few decades. Yet, deploying RL policies in real-world scenarios presents the crucial challenge of ensuring safety. Traditional safe RL approaches have predominantly focused on incorporating predefined safety constraints into the policy learning process. However, this reliance on predefined safety constraints poses limitations in dynamic and unpredictable real-world settings where such constraints may not be available or sufficiently adaptable. Bridging this gap, we propose a novel approach that concurrently learns a safe RL control policy and identifies the unknown safety constraint parameters of a given environment. Initializing with a parametric signal temporal logic (pSTL) safety specification and a small initial labeled dataset, we frame the problem as a bilevel optimization task, intricately integrating constrained policy optimization, using a Lagrangian-variant of the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, with Bayesian optimization for optimizing parameters for the given pSTL safety specification. Through experimentation in comprehensive case studies, we validate the efficacy of this approach across varying forms of environmental constraints, consistently yielding safe RL policies with high returns. Furthermore, our findings indicate successful learning of STL safety constraint parameters, exhibiting a high degree of conformity with true environmental safety constraints. The performance of our model closely mirrors that of an ideal scenario that possesses complete prior knowledge of safety constraints, demonstrating its proficiency in accurately identifying environmental safety constraints and learning safe policies that adhere to those constraints."

    "title": "Preventing Unconstrained CBF Safety Filters Caused by Invalid Relative Degree Assumptions",
    "published_date": "2024-09-17",
    "abstract": "Control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filters are used to certify and modify potentially unsafe control inputs to a system such as those provided by a reinforcement learning agent or a non-expert user. In this context, safety is defined as the satisfaction of state constraints. Originally designed for continuous-time systems, CBF safety filters typically assume that the system's relative degree is well-defined and is constant across the domain; however, this assumption is restrictive and rarely verified -- even linear system dynamics with a quadratic CBF candidate may not satisfy this assumption. In real-world applications, continuous-time CBF safety filters are implemented in discrete time, exacerbating issues related to violating the condition on the relative degree. These violations can lead to the safety filter being unconstrained (any control input may be certified) for a finite time interval and result in chattering issues and constraint violations. We propose an alternative formulation to address these challenges. Specifically, we present a theoretically sound method that employs multiple CBFs to generate bounded control inputs at each state within the safe set, thereby preventing incorrect certification of arbitrary control inputs. Using this approach, we derive conditions on the maximum sampling time to ensure safety in discrete-time implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through simulations and real-world quadrotor experiments, successfully preventing chattering and constraint violations. Finally, we discuss the implications of violating the relative degree condition on CBF synthesis and learning-based CBF methods."

    "title": "Auxiliary- Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions for Safety Critical Systems",
    "published_date": "2023-04-01",
    "abstract": "It has been shown that optimizing quadratic costs for affine control systems subject to state and control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). One of the main challenges in this method is that the CBF-based QPs can easily become infeasible under tight control bounds, especially when the control bounds are time-varying. The recently proposed adaptive CBFs have addressed such infeasibility issues, but require extensive and non-trivial hyperparameter tuning and may introduce overshooting control near the boundaries of the safe sets. In this paper, we propose a new type of adaptive CBFs called Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive CBFs (AVCBFs). Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary variable that multiplies each CBF, and define dynamics for the auxiliary variable to adapt it in constructing the corresponding CBF constraint. In this way, we improve the feasibility of the CBF -based QPs while avoiding extensive parameter tuning with non-overshooting control. We demonstrate the advantages of using AVCBFs and compare them with existing techniques on an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) problem with time-varying control bounds.",

    "title": "Consolidated Control Barrier Functions: Synthesis and Online Verification via Adaptation under Input Constraints",
    "published_date": "2023-04-04",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a novel adaptation-based approach to constrained control design under multiple state and input constraints. Specifically, we introduce a method for synthesizing any number of time-varying candidate control barrier functions (CBF) into one consolidated CBF (C-CBF) candidate, and propose a predictor-corrector optimization-based adaptation law for the weights of the constituent constraint functions that certifies the C-CBF as valid for a class of nonlinear, control-affine systems. We prove this result by showing that the adapted weights are guaranteed to confer sufficient control authority to meet the new, adaptive C-CBF condition in perpetuity despite input constraints, which thereby permits its use in a quadratic program based control law. We then illustrate the performance of our controller on an academic example, and further highlight that it is successful even for constraint functions with higher or mixed relative-degree by simulating a reach-avoid problem for bicycle robots, which we use to demonstrate how our approach out-performs two baseline approaches.",

    "title": "Safe and Stable Adaptive Control for a Class of Dynamic Systems",
    "published_date": "2023-09-11",
    "abstract": "Adaptive control has focused on online control of dynamic systems in the presence of parametric uncertainties, with solutions guaranteeing stability and control performance. Safety, a related property to stability, is becoming increasingly important as the footprint of autonomous systems grows in society. One of the popular ways for ensuring safety is through the notion of a control barrier function (CBF). In this paper, we combine adaptation and CBFs to develop a real-time controller that guarantees stability and remains safe in the presence of parametric uncertainties. The class of dynamic systems that we focus on is linear time-invariant systems whose states are accessible and where the inputs are subject to a magnitude limit. Conditions of stability, state convergence to a desired value, and parameter learning are all elucidated. One of the elements of the proposed adaptive controller that ensures stability and safety is the use of a CBF-based safety filter that suitably generates safe reference commands, employs error-based relaxation (EBR) of Nagumo's theorem, and leads to guarantees of set invariance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present two numerical examples, an obstacle avoidance case and a missile flight control case.",

    "title": "Adaptive Model Predictive Control for Constrained Nonlinear Systems",
    "abstract": "Abstract A true adaptive nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm must address the issue of robustness to model uncertainty while the estimator is evolving. Unfortunately, this may not be achieved without introducing extra degree of conservativeness and/or computational complexity in the controller calculations. To attenuate this problem, we employ a finite time identifier and propose an adaptive predictive control structure that reduces to a nominal MPC problem when exact parameter estimates are obtained. The adaptive MPC is formulated in such a way that useful excitation is automatically injected into the closed loop system to decrease the identification period.",
