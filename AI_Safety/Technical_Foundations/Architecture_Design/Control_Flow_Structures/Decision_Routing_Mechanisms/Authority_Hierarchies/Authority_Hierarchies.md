### Mini Description

Frameworks for establishing and maintaining clear lines of decision-making authority between system components, including mechanisms for delegation and override.

### Description

Authority Hierarchies in AI systems establish formal structures for delegating and managing decision-making power across different components. These hierarchies define clear chains of command, specify conditions under which authority can be transferred or overridden, and ensure that critical decisions are made at appropriate levels with proper oversight. The design of these hierarchies must balance the need for efficient local decision-making with maintaining global safety constraints and alignment with system objectives.

Current research explores various models of authority distribution, from strict top-down hierarchies to more flexible arrangements that allow for context-dependent authority allocation. Key challenges include designing mechanisms that prevent authority creep or unauthorized assumption of control, ensuring that emergency override systems cannot be circumvented, and maintaining clear accountability trails for all significant decisions. This includes developing formal frameworks for reasoning about authority relationships and proving properties about the flow of control within the system.

A central focus is creating authority structures that remain stable and effective as AI systems become more capable. This involves designing mechanisms that can adapt to changing circumstances while preserving critical safety properties, preventing the formation of hidden authority channels, and ensuring that lower-level components cannot collude to bypass higher-level controls. Particular attention is given to the interface between human operators and AI systems, including mechanisms for maintaining meaningful human oversight without creating bottlenecks in decision-making processes.
