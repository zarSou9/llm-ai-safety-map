    "title": "An information flow control meta-model",
    "abstract": "In this paper a meta-model for information flow control is defined using the foundation of Barker's access control meta-model. The purposes for defining this meta-model is to achieve a more principled understanding of information flow control, to compare information flow control and access control at an abstract level, and to explore how information flow control and access control might be composed to yield a rich new set of ideas and systems for controlling the dissemination of sensitive information. It is shown that it is possible to define a meta-model for information flow control, that such a model is more complex compared to the access control meta-model, and that the meta-models for information flow control and access control can be composed in a conceptually straightforward way.",

    "title": "Information flow control for stream processing in clouds",
    "abstract": "In the near future, clouds will provide situational monitoring services using streaming data. Examples of such services include health monitoring, stock market monitoring, shopping cart monitoring, and emergency control and threat management. Offering such services require securely processing data streams generated by multiple, possibly competing and/or complementing, organizations. Processing of data streams also should not cause any overt or covert leakage of information across organizations. We propose an information flow control model adapted from the Chinese Wall policy that can be used to protect against sensitive data disclosure. We propose architectures that are suitable for securely and efficiently processing streaming information belonging to different organizations. We discuss how performance can be further improved by sharing the processing of multiple queries. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by implementing a prototype of our system and show the overhead incurred due to the information flow constraints.",

    "title": "Implementation of decentralized per-flow control based on timescale decomposition for software defined networks",
    "abstract": "SDN (Software Defined Networks) consists of a set of underlying programmable switches and a cluster of control entities which governs the distributed programmable switches. Typically, for the convenience of setup and operation, the cluster of control entities is configured into a single node with the centralized control, which however has scalability concerns due to the long time-delay between the single control entity and the programmable switches. Thus, in this paper, to partially address the above concerns and to enable more diverse features, we are currently working on how to design the decentralized per-flow control based on timescale decomposition for SDNs by focusing on the practical implementation viewpoint.",
