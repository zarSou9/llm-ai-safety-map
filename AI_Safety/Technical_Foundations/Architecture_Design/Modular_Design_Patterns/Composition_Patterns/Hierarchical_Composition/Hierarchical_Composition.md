### Mini Description

Patterns for organizing modules in hierarchical structures with clear authority relationships and information flow paths, including methods for maintaining safety guarantees across levels of abstraction.

### Description

Hierarchical Composition in AI safety focuses on organizing AI system components into structured layers of authority and responsibility, where higher-level modules direct and constrain the behavior of lower-level ones. This approach draws inspiration from organizational theory and control systems engineering, aiming to create clear chains of command that can enforce safety constraints and maintain system-wide alignment. The key challenge lies in ensuring that safety properties and constraints propagate effectively through the hierarchy while preventing lower-level components from subverting or circumventing higher-level directives.

Current research explores various hierarchical patterns, from strict command-and-control architectures to more flexible arrangements that allow for limited autonomy at lower levels while maintaining safety bounds. Particular attention is given to designing interfaces between hierarchical levels that preserve safety properties while allowing necessary information flow in both directions. This includes developing formal frameworks for specifying and enforcing hierarchical constraints, methods for aggregating and filtering information as it moves up the hierarchy, and mechanisms for translating high-level directives into concrete actions at lower levels.

A central challenge is managing the trade-off between control and flexibility across hierarchical levels. Too rigid a hierarchy may limit system adaptability and create single points of failure, while too loose a structure risks safety properties being violated through complex inter-level interactions. Research focuses on developing adaptive hierarchical structures that can maintain safety guarantees while allowing appropriate levels of autonomy and initiative at different levels of the system. This includes work on meta-learning approaches for hierarchy formation, methods for dynamic restructuring of hierarchical relationships, and techniques for detecting and preventing hierarchy violations.
