    "title": "Communicating Compositional Patterns",
    "abstract": "How do people perceive and communicate structure? We investigate this question by letting participants play a communication game, where one player describes a pattern, and another player redraws it based on the description alone. We use this paradigm to compare two models of pattern description, one compositional (complex structures built out of simpler ones) and one non-compositional. We find that compositional patterns are communicated more effectively than non-compositional patterns, that a compositional model of pattern description predicts which patterns are harder to describe, and that this model can be used to evaluate participants' drawings, producing human-like quality ratings. Our results suggest that natural language can tap into a compositionally structured pattern description language.",
