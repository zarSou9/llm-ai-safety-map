### Mini Description

Approaches to combining modules in decentralized architectures, focusing on maintaining safety properties through local rules and coordination protocols.

### Description

Distributed Composition in AI safety addresses the challenge of combining AI modules in decentralized architectures where no single component has complete control or information. This approach requires careful design of coordination protocols, consensus mechanisms, and safety constraints that can be enforced locally while ensuring global system safety. Key considerations include managing partial information, handling communication delays and failures, and preventing unintended coordination failures or conflicts.

Current research explores various mechanisms for distributed safety enforcement, from Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols adapted for AI systems to novel approaches for distributed value learning and alignment. Particular attention is given to developing robust communication protocols that maintain safety guarantees even under adversarial conditions or partial system failures. This includes work on distributed monitoring systems, decentralized constraint enforcement, and methods for detecting and responding to anomalous behavior in distributed settings.

A central challenge lies in managing the inherent tension between local autonomy and global safety constraints. Research investigates how to design distributed systems that can operate effectively under uncertainty while maintaining safety guarantees, including approaches to distributed decision-making that preserve alignment properties. Open questions include how to scale distributed safety mechanisms to large numbers of modules, how to handle dynamic changes in system topology, and how to ensure that local optimization doesn't lead to globally suboptimal or unsafe outcomes.
