### Mini Description

Approaches to specifying and managing uncertainty in module interactions, including probabilistic contracts and robust interfaces that handle partial or unreliable information.

### Description

Uncertainty Handling in interface specifications addresses the fundamental challenge of managing and propagating uncertainty between AI system modules while maintaining safety guarantees. This includes developing formal frameworks for representing different types of uncertainty (epistemic, aleatoric, and model uncertainty), specifying how uncertainty information should be communicated across module boundaries, and ensuring that downstream modules appropriately incorporate uncertainty information in their decision-making processes.

Current research focuses on developing robust mathematical frameworks that can capture complex uncertainty relationships while remaining computationally tractable. This includes work on probabilistic contracts that specify distributional guarantees, methods for propagating uncertainty bounds through module chains, and techniques for maintaining conservative safety estimates under partial or imperfect information. Particular attention is given to handling edge cases and tail risks, ensuring that interface specifications remain valid even under extreme or unexpected conditions.

A key challenge lies in balancing the precision of uncertainty representations against their computational and communication overhead. Researchers are exploring compressed uncertainty representations, adaptive precision mechanisms, and hierarchical uncertainty models that can efficiently capture relevant information at different levels of abstraction. This includes developing methods for uncertainty quantification that remain valid under module composition and techniques for detecting when uncertainty estimates become unreliable or require refinement.
