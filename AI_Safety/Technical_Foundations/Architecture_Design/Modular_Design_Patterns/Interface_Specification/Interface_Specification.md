### Mini Description

Methods for defining and enforcing formal contracts between modules, including protocols for safe information exchange and verification of interface properties.

### Description

Interface Specification in AI safety focuses on defining formal contracts and protocols that govern interactions between different modules in an AI system. These specifications must ensure that safety properties are preserved across module boundaries while enabling necessary information flow and functionality. This includes developing precise semantics for data exchange, establishing invariants that must be maintained, and creating verification mechanisms to ensure compliance with interface contracts.

Current research explores various formal methods for specifying interfaces, from type systems and behavioral contracts to temporal logic specifications and probabilistic guarantees. Key challenges include handling uncertainty and partial information, managing temporal dependencies between modules, and ensuring that interface specifications remain tractable as system complexity increases. Researchers are particularly focused on developing specifications that can capture safety-critical properties while remaining practical to implement and verify.

A central area of investigation is the development of compositional reasoning frameworks that allow safety properties to be verified across module boundaries. This includes work on assume-guarantee reasoning, where modules make explicit assumptions about their environment and provide guarantees about their behavior, as well as research on interface theories that support incremental system development while maintaining safety properties. Particular attention is given to specifications that can handle dynamic reconfiguration and adaptation while preserving safety invariants.
