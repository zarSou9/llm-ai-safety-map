    "title": "Compositional Separation of Control Flow and Data Flow",
    "published_date": "2023-09-12",
    "abstract": "Every Model of High-Level Computation (MHC) has an underlying composition mechanism for combining simple computation devices into more complex ones. Composition can be done by (explicitly or implicitly) defining control flow, data flow or any combination thereof. Control flow specifies the order in which individual computations are activated, whereas data flow defines how data is exchanged among them. Unfortunately, traditional MHCs either mix data and control or only consider one dimension explicitly, which makes it difficult to reason about data flow and control flow separately. Reasoning about these dimensions orthogonally is a crucial desideratum for optimisation, maintainability and verification purposes. In this paper, we introduce a novel MHC that explicitly treats data flow and control flow as separate dimensions, while providing modularity. As the model is rooted in category theory, it provides category-theoretic operations for compositionally constructing sequential, parallel, branchial or iterative composites. Compositionality entails that a composite exhibits the same properties as its respective constituents, including separation of concerns and modularity. We conclude the paper by demonstrating how our proposal can be used to model high-level computations in two different application domains: software engineering and artificial intelligence."

    "title": "Inching Towards Automated Understanding of the Meaning of Art: An Application to Computational Analysis of Mondrian's Artwork",
    "published_date": "2022-12-29",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successfully used in classifying digital images but have been less successful in classifying images with meanings that are not linear combinations of their visualized features, like images of artwork. Moreover, it is unknown what additional features must be included into DNNs, so that they can possibly classify using features beyond visually displayed features, like color, size, and form. Non-displayed features are important in abstract representations, reasoning, and understanding ambiguous expressions, which are arguably topics less studied by current AI methods. This paper attempts to identify capabilities that are related to semantic processing, a current limitation of DNNs. The proposed methodology identifies the missing capabilities by comparing the process of understanding Mondrian's paintings with the process of understanding electronic circuit designs, another creative problem solving instance. The compared entities are cognitive architectures that attempt to loosely mimic cognitive activities. The paper offers a detailed presentation of the characteristics of the architectural components, like goals, concepts, ideas, rules, procedures, beliefs, expectations, and outcomes. To explain the usefulness of the methodology, the paper discusses a new, three-step computational method to distinguish Mondrian's paintings from other artwork. The method includes in a backward order the cognitive architecture's components that operate only with the characteristics of the available data."

    "title": "Coordination Among Neural Modules Through a Shared Global Workspace",
    "published_date": "2021-03-01",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has seen a movement away from representing examples with a monolithic hidden state towards a richly structured state. For example, Transformers segment by position, and object-centric architectures decompose images into entities. In all these architectures, interactions between different elements are modeled via pairwise interactions: Transformers make use of self-attention to incorporate information from other positions; object-centric architectures make use of graph neural networks to model interactions among entities. However, pairwise interactions may not achieve global coordination or a coherent, integrated representation that can be used for downstream tasks. In cognitive science, a global workspace architecture has been proposed in which functionally specialized components share information through a common, bandwidth-limited communication channel. We explore the use of such a communication channel in the context of deep learning for modeling the structure of complex environments. The proposed method includes a shared workspace through which communication among different specialist modules takes place but due to limits on the communication bandwidth, specialist modules must compete for access. We show that capacity limitations have a rational basis in that (1) they encourage specialization and compositionality and (2) they facilitate the synchronization of otherwise independent specialists.",

    "abstract": "We propose a unified architecture for next generation cognitive, low cost, mobile internet. The end user platform is able to scale as per the application and network requirements. It takes computing out of the data center and into end user platform. Internet enables open standards, accessible computing and applications programmability on a commodity platform. The architecture is a super-set to present day infrastructure web computing. The Java virtual machine (JVM) derives from the stack architecture. Applications can be developed and deployed on a multitude of host platforms. O(1) ↔ O(N). Computing and the internet today are more accessible and available to the larger community. Machine learning has made extensive advances with the availability of modern computing. It is used widely in NLP, Computer Vision, Deep learning and AI.

    "title": "A Model for General Intelligence",
    "published_date": "2018-11-06",
    "abstract": "The overarching problem in artificial intelligence (AI) is that we do not understand the intelligence process well enough to enable the development of adequate computational models. Much work has been done in AI over the years at lower levels, but a big part of what has been missing involves the high level, abstract, general nature of intelligence. We address this gap by developing a model for general intelligence. To accomplish this, we focus on three basic aspects of intelligence. First, we must realize the general order and nature of intelligence at a high level. Second, we must come to know what these realizations mean with respect to the overall intelligence process. Third, we must describe these realizations as clearly as possible. We propose a hierarchical model to help capture and exploit the order within intelligence. The underlying order involves patterns of signals that become organized, stored and activated in space and time. These patterns can be described using a simple, general hierarchy, with physical signals at the lowest level, information in the middle, and abstract signal representations at the top. This high level perspective provides a big picture that literally helps us see the intelligence process, thereby enabling fundamental realizations, a better understanding and clear descriptions of the intelligence process. The resulting model can be used to support all kinds of information processing across multiple levels of abstraction. As computer technology improves, and as cooperation increases between humans and computers, people will become more efficient and more productive in performing their information processing tasks."
