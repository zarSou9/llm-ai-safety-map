### Mini Description

Designs for sequential processing stages that mirror cognitive functions like perception, reasoning, and action selection, including mechanisms for maintaining separation between stages while allowing necessary information flow.

### Description

Cognitive Pipeline Patterns focus on designing sequential processing architectures that decompose AI cognition into distinct, ordered stages. These patterns draw inspiration from cognitive psychology and neuroscience models of information processing, implementing structured flows from sensory input through various processing stages to action output. The key challenge lies in maintaining clear boundaries between stages while allowing necessary information flow and feedback loops.

Current research explores different approaches to stage separation and interaction, from strict feed-forward architectures to more flexible designs incorporating controlled feedback mechanisms. Particular attention is given to managing information flow between stages, ensuring that each stage receives appropriate inputs while preventing unauthorized access or modification of intermediate representations. This includes work on input sanitization, output validation, and mechanisms for detecting and handling anomalous processing patterns.

A central research challenge involves balancing the benefits of strict pipeline separation against the need for flexible information sharing and adaptation. This includes developing methods for safe pipeline reconfiguration during operation, handling cases where multiple pipeline instances must coordinate, and ensuring that pipeline structures remain robust under capability scaling. Researchers are particularly interested in patterns that maintain functional isolation while supporting advanced capabilities like meta-learning and online adaptation.
