### Mini Description

Approaches to decomposing AI systems based on distinct cognitive functions or capabilities, including perception, planning, and execution modules with well-defined interfaces.

### Description

Functional Separation Patterns focus on decomposing AI systems based on distinct cognitive capabilities or processing stages, drawing inspiration from both software engineering principles and cognitive science. This approach aims to create clear boundaries between different types of information processing, decision-making, and action generation, allowing for better verification, debugging, and modification of specific system capabilities while maintaining overall system coherence.

Current research explores various paradigms for functional decomposition, from traditional perception-planning-action loops to more sophisticated architectures incorporating metacognition, attention mechanisms, and parallel processing pathways. Key challenges include determining appropriate granularity of separation, managing cross-module dependencies, and ensuring that separated functions can be effectively reintegrated without losing critical information or introducing safety vulnerabilities.

A central focus is developing patterns that maintain functional separation under increasing system capabilities while preventing the emergence of cross-cutting concerns that could bypass intended separations. This includes research on hierarchical architectures that preserve functional boundaries across different levels of abstraction, mechanisms for managing shared resources between functionally distinct components, and approaches to handling cases where clear functional separation becomes theoretically or practically challenging.
