### Mini Description

Methods and interfaces for accurately capturing human preferences, including active learning approaches, preference modeling, and techniques for handling uncertainty in human input.

### Description

Preference Elicitation focuses on developing methods and interfaces to accurately capture human values, preferences, and intentions for AI systems. This involves addressing fundamental challenges such as preference inconsistency, context-dependence, and the difficulty of articulating complex values. Key approaches include direct questioning, revealed preferences through choices, and comparative feedback methods, each with their own strengths and limitations in extracting accurate preference information.

Current research emphasizes the development of adaptive elicitation strategies that minimize cognitive burden while maximizing information gain. This includes work on active learning approaches that intelligently select queries, methods for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in human responses, and techniques for identifying and resolving apparent inconsistencies in stated preferences. Particular attention is given to understanding how different elicitation methods might introduce biases or distortions in the captured preferences.

A critical area of investigation is the development of methods that can handle complex, hierarchical preference structures and capture nuanced ethical considerations. This includes research on decomposing complex preferences into more manageable components, techniques for eliciting meta-preferences about how to handle trade-offs and edge cases, and approaches for capturing time-varying or context-dependent preferences. The field also explores how to validate elicited preferences and ensure they truly reflect the intended values of the human providing input.
