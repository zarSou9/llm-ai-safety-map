### Mini Description

Formal and semi-formal languages for expressing objectives, constraints, and preferences in ways that are both human-readable and machine-interpretable.

### Description

Specification Languages in AI safety focus on developing formal and semi-formal methods for expressing objectives, constraints, and preferences in ways that bridge human intent and machine execution. These languages must balance expressiveness with precision, allowing complex human values and goals to be captured while maintaining mathematical rigor and computational tractability. Key challenges include handling context-dependence, managing abstraction levels, and ensuring specifications remain robust under edge cases and system evolution.

Current research explores various paradigms, from purely logical frameworks based on temporal and modal logics to hybrid approaches that combine formal specifications with natural language processing. Particular attention is given to languages that support compositional reasoning, allowing complex specifications to be built from simpler components while preserving safety properties. This includes work on probabilistic specification languages for handling uncertainty, causal languages for expressing interventions and counterfactuals, and domain-specific languages tailored to particular safety requirements.

A critical area of development is creating specification languages that support verification and analysis while remaining accessible to non-experts. This involves developing intermediate representations that can be automatically checked for consistency, tools for translating between different levels of abstraction, and methods for detecting ambiguity or underspecification. Research also focuses on languages that can express both behavioral constraints and underlying principles, enabling systems to generalize specifications appropriately in novel situations.
