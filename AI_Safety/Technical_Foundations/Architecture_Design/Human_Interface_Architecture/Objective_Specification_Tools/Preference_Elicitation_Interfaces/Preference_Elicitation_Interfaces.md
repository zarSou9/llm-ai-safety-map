### Mini Description

Interactive tools for systematically extracting and formalizing human preferences, including methods for handling uncertainty and resolving contradictions.

### Description

Preference Elicitation Interfaces focus on designing interactive systems that effectively capture human preferences, values, and priorities in a format suitable for AI systems. These interfaces must bridge the gap between human intuitive understanding and machine-readable specifications while accounting for cognitive biases, inconsistencies in human preferences, and the challenge of articulating complex value structures. Key considerations include minimizing cognitive load, handling uncertainty and ambiguity, and ensuring the elicitation process itself doesn't inadvertently shape or distort the preferences being captured.

Current research explores various elicitation methodologies, from direct comparison and ranking tasks to more sophisticated approaches using hypothetical scenarios and multi-attribute utility assessment. Particular attention is given to active learning techniques that can efficiently identify relevant preference information while minimizing the number of queries needed. This includes developing adaptive questioning strategies, methods for detecting and resolving inconsistencies in stated preferences, and techniques for extrapolating complete preference structures from limited input.

A critical challenge lies in handling the context-dependent and dynamic nature of human preferences. This involves developing interfaces that can capture how preferences change across different situations, understand the hierarchical structure of human values, and account for meta-preferences about how preferences themselves should be treated. Research also focuses on methods for helping users explore and understand their own preferences, including tools for preference reflection, visualization of preference implications, and techniques for identifying potential conflicts or tensions between different values.
