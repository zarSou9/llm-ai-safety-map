### Mini Description

Mathematical frameworks for understanding how alignment properties compose across recursive structures and formal guarantees for maintaining alignment through chains of oversight.

### Description

Composition Theory in recursive oversight focuses on developing mathematical frameworks to understand and guarantee how alignment properties propagate through chains of AI systems supervising other AI systems. This includes formal methods for proving that desired safety and alignment properties are preserved when systems are composed, as well as techniques for bounding the accumulation or amplification of errors across recursive structures.

A central challenge is developing composition theorems that can handle the dynamic and uncertain nature of AI systems. Unlike traditional software composition where behaviors are more deterministic, AI systems may exhibit emergent properties or unexpected interactions when combined. Current research explores various mathematical frameworks including category theory, abstract interpretation, and probabilistic guarantees to reason about composed systems while accounting for uncertainty and non-determinism.

Key open questions include how to formally specify and verify alignment properties in a way that supports compositional reasoning, how to handle potential amplification of subtle misalignments through recursive chains, and how to develop modular proofs that remain valid as individual components are updated or improved. Researchers are particularly interested in frameworks that can provide meaningful guarantees while remaining tractable for practical implementation.
