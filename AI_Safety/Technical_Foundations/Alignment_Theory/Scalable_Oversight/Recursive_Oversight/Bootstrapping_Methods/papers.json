    "title": "Bootstrapping Public Blockchains Without a Trusted Setup",
    "abstract": "We propose a protocol that allows the participants of a permissionless decentralized system to agree on a set of identities in the presence of a computationally-bounded Byzantine adversary. Our protocol guarantees that the fraction of identities belonging to the adversary in the set of identities is at most equal to the total computational hash power of the adversary. We significantly improve on the existing state-of-the-art in the following four ways. First, our algorithm runs in expected O(1) rounds, in contrast to previous results which require O(log n/log log n) rounds, where n is the number of initial nodes in the system. Second, we require each node to solve just one computational puzzle, whereas previous algorithms require O(log n/log log n) puzzles per node. Third, our algorithm sends only O(n) bits per node in expectation, whereas previous algorithms send O( (log2 n/log log n)) bits in expectation. Finally, in contrast to past results, our algorithm handles dynamic joining and leaving of nodes.",

    "title": "You Shall Not Join: A Measurement Study of Cryptocurrency Peer-to-Peer Bootstrapping Techniques",
    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies are digital assets which depend upon the use of distributed peer-to-peer networks. The method a new peer uses to initially join a peer-to-peer network is known as bootstrapping. The ability to bootstrap without the use of a centralized resource is an unresolved challenge. In this paper we survey the bootstrapping techniques used by 74 cryptocurrencies and find that censorship-prone methods such as DNS seeding and IP hard-coding are the most prevalent. In response to this finding, we test two other bootstrapping techniques less susceptible to censorship, Tor and ZMap, to determine if they are operationally feasible alternatives more resilient to censorship. We perform a global measurement study of DNS query responses for each the 92 DNS seeds discovered across 42 countries using the distributed RIPE Atlas network. This provides details of each cryptocurrencies' peer-to-peer network topology and also highlights instances of DNS outages and query manipulation impacting the bootstrapping process. Our study also reveals that the source code of the cryptocurrencies researched comes from only five main repositories; hence accounting for the inheritance of legacy bootstrapping methods. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and provide recommendations to mitigate the risks exposed.",
