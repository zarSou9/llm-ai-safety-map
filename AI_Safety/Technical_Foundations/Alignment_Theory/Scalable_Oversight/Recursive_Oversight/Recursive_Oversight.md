### Mini Description

Methods where AI systems participate in the oversight of other AI systems, including recursive reward modeling and hierarchical supervision structures.

### Description

Recursive Oversight explores approaches where AI systems assist in or directly participate in the supervision and alignment of other AI systems. This includes frameworks where more capable AI systems help train or oversee less capable ones, as well as methods for decomposing complex oversight tasks into manageable sub-problems that can be delegated across multiple systems. The core challenge is ensuring that such recursive structures maintain alignment throughout the chain of oversight, avoiding potential degradation or amplification of misalignment.

Current research focuses on developing formal frameworks for understanding how alignment properties propagate through recursive structures. This includes work on composition theorems for aligned systems, methods for detecting and correcting alignment drift, and techniques for maintaining robust oversight chains even when individual components may be imperfect. Particular attention is paid to the theoretical foundations needed to ensure that recursive oversight remains stable and reliable as it scales to more capable systems.

Key open questions include how to initialize recursive oversight chains with sufficient reliability, how to verify that alignment is preserved through multiple layers of recursion, and how to handle cases where systems may need to oversee tasks beyond their own capabilities. Researchers are also investigating the relationship between recursive oversight and other alignment approaches, such as debate and amplification, to develop hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of multiple methods while mitigating their individual weaknesses.
