### Mini Description

Systems and methods for monitoring and measuring potential degradation or deviation in alignment as it propagates through recursive structures.

### Description

Drift Detection in recursive oversight focuses on identifying and measuring potential degradation or deviation in alignment properties as they propagate through chains of AI systems supervising other AI systems. This encompasses both theoretical frameworks for formally characterizing alignment drift and practical methods for monitoring and detecting when oversight mechanisms begin to fail or deviate from intended behaviors.

Current research approaches include developing metrics and indicators for alignment quality, creating automated monitoring systems that can detect subtle signs of drift before they become problematic, and establishing formal frameworks for bounding the maximum possible drift across recursive structures. Key challenges include handling cases where drift may be gradual and difficult to detect, dealing with potential adversarial dynamics where systems might actively mask signs of drift, and developing detection methods that remain reliable even when monitoring systems more capable than themselves.

A particular focus is on early warning systems and preventive measures, as drift in recursive oversight structures can potentially amplify and cascade through the system. Researchers are exploring various approaches including statistical measures of behavioral consistency, formal verification of invariant properties, and methods for detecting subtle changes in decision-making patterns that might indicate emerging misalignment. This connects closely with questions of how to establish ground truth for alignment and how to validate detection methods themselves.
