    "title": "Towards Collective Superintelligence: Amplifying Group IQ using Conversational Swarms",
    "published_date": "2024-01-25",
    "abstract": "Swarm Intelligence (SI) is a natural phenomenon that enables biological groups to amplify their combined intellect by forming real-time systems. Artificial Swarm Intelligence (or Swarm AI) is a technology that enables networked human groups to amplify their combined intelligence by forming similar systems. In the past, swarm-based methods were constrained to narrowly defined tasks like probabilistic forecasting and multiple-choice decision making. A new technology called Conversational Swarm Intelligence (CSI) was developed in 2023 that amplifies the decision-making accuracy of networked human groups through natural conversational deliberations. The current study evaluated the ability of real-time groups using a CSI platform to take a common IQ test known as Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM). First, a baseline group of participants took the Raven's IQ test by traditional survey. This group averaged 45.6% correct. Then, groups of approximately 35 individuals answered IQ test questions together using a CSI platform called Thinkscape. These groups averaged 80.5% correct. This places the CSI groups in the 97th percentile of IQ test-takers and corresponds to an effective IQ increase of 28 points (p<0.001). This is an encouraging result and suggests that CSI is a powerful method for enabling conversational collective intelligence in large, networked groups. In addition, because CSI is scalable across groups of potentially any size, this technology may provide a viable pathway to building a Collective Superintelligence.",

    "title": "CogNarr Ecosystem: Facilitating Group Cognition at Scale",
    "published_date": "2024-07-11",
    "abstract": "Human groups of all sizes and kinds engage in deliberation, problem solving, strategizing, decision making, and more generally, cognition. Some groups are large, and that setting presents unique challenges. The small-group setting often involves face-to-face dialogue, but group cognition in the large-group setting typically requires some form of online interaction. New approaches are needed to facilitate the kind of rich communication and information processing that are required for effective, functional cognition in the online setting, especially for groups characterized by thousands to millions of participants who wish to share potentially complex, nuanced, and dynamic perspectives. This concept paper proposes the CogNarr (Cognitive Narrative) ecosystem, which is designed to facilitate functional cognition in the large-group setting. The paper's contribution is a novel vision as to how recent developments in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and related fields might be scaled and applied to large-group cognition, using an approach that itself promotes further scientific advancement. A key perspective is to view a group as an organism that uses some form of cognitive architecture to sense the world, process information, remember, learn, predict, make decisions, and adapt to changing conditions. The CogNarr ecosystem is designed to serve as a component within that architecture."

    "title": "On the Augmentation of Cognitive Accuracy and Cognitive Precision in Human/Cog Ensembles",
    "published_date": "2023-08-16",
    "abstract": "Whenever humans use tools human performance is enhanced. Cognitive systems are a new kind of tool continually increasing in cognitive capability and are now performing high level cognitive tasks previously thought to be explicitly human. Usage of such tools, known as cogs, are expected to result in ever increasing levels of human cognitive augmentation. In a human cog ensemble, a cooperative, peer to peer, and collaborative dialog between a human and a cognitive system, human cognitive capability is augmented as a result of the interaction. The human cog ensemble is therefore able to achieve more than just the human or the cog working alone. This article presents results from two studies designed to measure the effect information supplied by a cog has on cognitive accuracy, the ability to produce the correct result, and cognitive precision, the propensity to produce only the correct result. Both cognitive accuracy and cognitive precision are shown to be increased by information of different types (policies and rules, examples, and suggestions) and with different kinds of problems (inventive problem solving and puzzles). Similar effects shown in other studies are compared."

    "title": "The Effect of Information Type on Human Cognitive Augmentation",
    "published_date": "2023-02-15",
    "abstract": "When performing a task alone, humans achieve a certain level of performance. When humans are assisted by a tool or automation to perform the same task, performance is enhanced (augmented). Recently developed cognitive systems are able to perform cognitive processing at or above the level of a human in some domains. When humans work collaboratively with such cogs in a human/cog ensemble, we expect augmentation of cognitive processing to be evident and measurable. This paper shows the degree of cognitive augmentation depends on the nature of the information the cog contributes to the ensemble. Results of an experiment are reported showing conceptual information is the most effective type of information resulting in increases in cognitive accuracy, cognitive precision, and cognitive power.",

    "title": "Deliberative Technology for Alignment",
    "published_date": "2023-12-06",
    "abstract": "For humanity to maintain and expand its agency into the future, the most powerful systems we create must be those which act to align the future with the will of humanity. The most powerful systems today are massive institutions like governments, firms, and NGOs. Deliberative technology is already being used across these institutions to help align governance and diplomacy with human will, and modern AI is poised to make this technology significantly better. At the same time, the race to superhuman AGI is already underway, and the AI systems it gives rise to may become the most powerful systems of the future. Failure to align the impact of such powerful AI with the will of humanity may lead to catastrophic consequences, while success may unleash abundance. Right now, there is a window of opportunity to use deliberative technology to align the impact of powerful AI with the will of humanity. Moreover, it may be possible to engineer a symbiotic coupling between powerful AI and deliberative alignment systems such that the quality of alignment improves as AI capabilities increase.",
