### Mini Description

Design of human-AI interaction frameworks that enable effective collaboration while maintaining meaningful human control and decision-making authority.

### Description

Collaborative Interfaces focuses on designing interaction frameworks that enable effective partnerships between humans and AI systems in oversight contexts. These interfaces must balance the complementary strengths of human judgment and AI capabilities while maintaining clear channels of communication, appropriate trust calibration, and meaningful human agency in decision-making processes.

Key research challenges include developing interfaces that appropriately convey uncertainty and confidence levels, managing attention and cognitive load, and establishing effective feedback mechanisms. This involves studying how to present AI-generated insights and recommendations in ways that inform rather than overwhelm human decision-makers, while ensuring humans remain actively engaged rather than becoming overly dependent on or dismissive of AI assistance.

Current work emphasizes adaptive interfaces that can adjust their interaction patterns based on context, user expertise, and task complexity. Researchers are exploring various modalities of interaction, from natural language interfaces to mixed-reality environments, while investigating how different interface designs affect human-AI team performance, trust dynamics, and the maintenance of human autonomy. Particular attention is given to preventing automation bias while fostering appropriate levels of trust through transparent communication of AI capabilities and limitations.
