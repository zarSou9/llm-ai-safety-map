    "published_date": "2024-09-05",
    "abstract": "Learning new tasks by drawing on prior experience gathered from other (related) tasks is a core property of any intelligent system. Gradient-based meta-learning, especially MAML and its variants, has emerged as a viable solution to accomplish this goal. One problem MAML encounters is its computational and memory burdens needed to compute the meta-gradients. We propose a new first-order variant of MAML that we prove converges to a stationary point of the MAML objective, unlike other first-order variants. We also show that the MAML objective does not satisfy the smoothness assumption assumed in previous works; we show instead that its smoothness constant grows with the norm of the meta-gradient, which theoretically suggests the use of normalized or clipped-gradient methods compared to the plain gradient method used in previous works. We validate our theory on a synthetic experiment.",

The authors also demonstrate that the MAML objective's smoothness depends on the meta-gradient norm, suggesting the benefit of normalized or clipped gradient methods."

    "title": "Calibration of Few-Shot Classification Tasks: Mitigating Misconfidence from Distribution Mismatch",
    "abstract": "As many meta-learning algorithms improve performance in solving few-shot classification problems for practical applications, the accurate prediction of uncertainty is considered essential. In meta-training, the algorithm treats all generated tasks equally and updates the model to perform well on training tasks. During the training, some of the tasks may make it difficult for the model to infer the query examples from the support examples, especially when a large mismatch between the support set and the query set exists. The distribution mismatch causes the model to have incorrect confidence, which causes a calibration problem. In this study, we propose a novel meta-training method that measures the distribution mismatch and enables the model to predict with more precise confidence. Moreover, our method is algorithm-agnostic and can be readily expanded to include a range of meta-learning models. Through extensive experimentation, including dataset shift, we show that our training strategy prevents the model from becoming indiscriminately confident, and thereby helps the model to produce calibrated classification results without the loss of accuracy.",

    "abstract": "We derive a novel information-theoretic analysis of the generalization property of meta-learning algorithms. Concretely, our analysis proposes a generic understanding of both the conventional learning-to-learn framework and the modern model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithms. Moreover, we provide a data-dependent generalization bound for a stochastic variant of MAML, which is non-vacuous for deep few-shot learning. As compared to previous bounds that depend on the square norm of gradients, empirical validations on both simulated data and a well-known few-shot benchmark show that our bound is orders of magnitude tighter in most situations.",

    "title": "Meta-Learning with Variational Bayes",
    "published_date": "2021-03-03",
    "abstract": "The field of meta-learning seeks to improve the ability of today's machine learning systems to adapt efficiently to small amounts of data. Typically this is accomplished by training a system with a parametrized update rule to improve a task-relevant objective based on supervision or a reward function. However, in many domains of practical interest, task data is unlabeled, or reward functions are unavailable. In this paper we introduce a new approach to address the more general problem of generative meta-learning, which we argue is an important prerequisite for obtaining human-level cognitive flexibility in artificial agents, and can benefit many practical applications along the way. Our contribution leverages the AEVB framework and mean-field variational Bayes, and creates fast-adapting latent-space generative models. At the heart of our contribution is a new result, showing that for a broad class of deep generative latent variable models, the relevant VB updates do not depend on any generative neural network. The theoretical merits of our approach are reflected in empirical experiments.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a novel generative meta-learning approach using variational Bayes, enabling fast adaptation in latent-space generative models even without labeled data or reward functions. A key finding is that the variational Bayes updates for a broad class of deep generative models are independent of the generative neural network itself."

    "abstract": "\n Optimal store placement aims to identify the optimal location for a new brick-and-mortar store that can maximize its sale by analyzing and mining users' preferences from large-scale urban data. In recent years, the expansion of chain enterprises in new cities brings some challenges because of two aspects: (1)\n data scarcity in new cities,\n so most existing models tend to not work (i.e., overfitting), because the superior performance of these works is conditioned on large-scale training samples; (2)\n data distribution discrepancy among different cities,\n so knowledge learned from other cities cannot be utilized directly in new cities. In this article, we propose a task-adaptative model-agnostic meta-learning framework, namely, MetaStore, to tackle these two challenges and improve the prediction performance in new cities with insufficient data for optimal store placement, by transferring prior knowledge learned from multiple data-rich cities. Specifically, we develop a task-adaptative meta-learning algorithm to learn city-specific prior initializations from multiple cities, which is capable of handling the multimodal data distribution and accelerating the adaptation in new cities compared to other methods. In addition, we design an effective learning strategy for MetaStore to promote faster convergence and optimization by sampling high-quality data for each training batch in view of noisy data in practical applications. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method leads to state-of-the-art performance compared with various baselines.\n",
