### Mini Description

Research on maintaining alignment through processes of self-improvement or recursive optimization, including corrigibility and stable self-modification.

### Description

Meta-Learning Alignment focuses on ensuring AI systems maintain their alignment with human values and intentions through processes of self-modification, learning, or improvement. This includes both theoretical frameworks for understanding how alignment properties persist or degrade during meta-learning, and practical approaches for implementing stable self-modification mechanisms. The field grapples with fundamental questions about how to create AI systems that can reliably improve themselves while preserving their original alignment properties.

A central challenge is the development of corrigibility mechanisms - ensuring that AI systems remain amenable to correction and modification even as they become more capable. This involves both technical approaches, such as designing update rules that preserve key safety properties, and theoretical work on formal frameworks for stable self-modification. Researchers explore concepts like conservation of purpose, value learning stability, and methods for maintaining human oversight through recursive self-improvement cycles.

Current research emphasizes understanding the fundamental limits and possibilities of self-modifying systems, including work on formal verification of meta-learning processes, theoretical bounds on safe self-improvement, and practical architectures for implementing stable meta-learning. Key areas include methods for detecting and preventing undesirable modifications, frameworks for reasoning about long-term stability of self-improving systems, and approaches for maintaining alignment across multiple generations of self-modification.
