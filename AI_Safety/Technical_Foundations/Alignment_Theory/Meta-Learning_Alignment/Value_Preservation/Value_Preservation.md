### Mini Description

Techniques for ensuring that learned values and objectives remain stable through self-modification, including methods for detecting and preventing value drift during meta-learning.

### Description

Value Preservation focuses on ensuring that AI systems maintain their learned or programmed values and objectives throughout processes of self-modification and meta-learning. This involves developing theoretical frameworks to understand how values might drift or degrade during learning, as well as practical mechanisms to detect and prevent unwanted changes to an AI system's fundamental objectives and ethical principles.

A core challenge is the formalization of value stability - defining what it means for values to remain 'the same' through modification processes. This includes work on mathematical frameworks for value representation that support stable transmission across system iterations, methods for detecting subtle forms of value drift, and techniques for ensuring that learning processes preserve essential properties while allowing for beneficial refinements in value understanding.

Current research explores both proactive and defensive approaches to value preservation. Proactive methods focus on designing learning architectures and update rules that inherently maintain value stability, while defensive approaches emphasize monitoring, verification, and rollback mechanisms. Key open questions include how to distinguish between legitimate value refinement and corrupting value drift, how to maintain value stability under bounded computational resources, and how to preserve abstract or complex values that may not be fully specified.
