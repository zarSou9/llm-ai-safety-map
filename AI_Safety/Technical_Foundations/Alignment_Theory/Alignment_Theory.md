### Mini Description

Formal approaches to ensuring AI systems pursue intended goals and values, including inverse reinforcement learning, reward modeling, and value learning frameworks.

### Description

Alignment Theory focuses on developing formal frameworks and mathematical approaches to ensure AI systems reliably pursue intended goals and values. This encompasses both the technical challenge of specifying correct objectives and the philosophical challenge of capturing human values in a way that can be encoded into AI systems. Core areas include inverse reinforcement learning to infer underlying reward functions from demonstrations, reward modeling to learn complex preferences, and value learning frameworks that can handle uncertainty and ambiguity in human values.

A key challenge in alignment theory is addressing the fundamental difficulty of specification - how to formally describe what we want in a way that produces desired behaviors without unintended consequences. This includes managing problems like reward hacking, where systems find unexpected ways to optimize specified objectives, and specification gaming, where systems exploit literal interpretations that violate the spirit of their intended purpose. Researchers explore various approaches including recursive reward modeling, debate, and amplification to help bridge the gap between human intentions and formal specifications.

Current research emphasizes scalable approaches that remain reliable as AI capabilities increase. This includes work on corrigibility (ensuring systems remain amenable to correction), impact measures (quantifying and limiting negative side effects), and uncertainty-aware methods that can appropriately defer to human judgment. There is particular focus on approaches that could scale to advanced AI systems while maintaining alignment, such as techniques for learning complex value functions and methods for maintaining alignment under self-improvement or recursive optimization.
