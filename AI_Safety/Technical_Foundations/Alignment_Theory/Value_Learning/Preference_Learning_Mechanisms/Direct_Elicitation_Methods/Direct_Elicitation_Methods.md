### Mini Description

Techniques for explicitly gathering preference information through structured interactions such as rankings, ratings, and pairwise comparisons, including interface design and query optimization.

### Description

Direct Elicitation Methods focuses on designing structured approaches and interfaces for explicitly gathering preference information from humans. These methods involve carefully crafted interactions where humans directly express their preferences through specific formats like rankings, ratings, comparisons, or choice scenarios. The field draws on insights from decision theory, behavioral economics, and human-computer interaction to develop elicitation techniques that are both intuitive for humans and informationally valuable for AI systems.

A central challenge is managing the cognitive load and potential biases inherent in direct preference expression. Humans often struggle to consistently quantify their preferences, may be influenced by framing effects, and can experience fatigue during extended elicitation sessions. Researchers explore various interface designs and elicitation protocols to minimize these issues while maximizing the quality and quantity of preference information obtained. This includes developing adaptive questionnaires, innovative visualization techniques, and methods for detecting and correcting inconsistent responses.

Current research emphasizes developing more sophisticated elicitation mechanisms that can capture nuanced preference structures, including conditional preferences, uncertainty in judgments, and relative importance of different criteria. Key areas of investigation include methods for eliciting preferences over complex or high-dimensional spaces, techniques for capturing meta-preferences about how decisions should be made, and approaches for maintaining engagement while ensuring response quality. There is particular focus on developing methods that scale efficiently with the complexity of the preference space while remaining accessible to non-expert users.
