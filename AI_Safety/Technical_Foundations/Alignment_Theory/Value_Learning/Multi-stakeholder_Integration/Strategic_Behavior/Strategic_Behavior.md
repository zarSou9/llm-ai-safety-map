### Mini Description

Approaches for handling strategic or adversarial behavior in multi-stakeholder systems, including mechanism design for truthful preference revelation and manipulation resistance.

### Description

Strategic Behavior in multi-stakeholder value learning focuses on understanding and addressing situations where participants may act strategically to influence AI systems' value learning processes for their own benefit. This includes both explicit manipulation attempts, such as providing false preference information, and subtle strategic behaviors like preference misrepresentation or coalition formation. The field draws on game theory, mechanism design, and social choice theory to develop frameworks that remain robust against such strategic actions while still effectively learning and integrating stakeholder values.

Current research emphasizes the development of incentive-compatible mechanisms that make truthful preference revelation optimal for participants. This includes exploring various elicitation protocols, reward structures, and participation mechanisms that discourage strategic manipulation while maintaining efficient preference aggregation. Particular attention is paid to handling partial observability, where the system must reason about potential strategic behavior with incomplete information about stakeholders' true preferences or motivations.

Emerging challenges include scaling strategic-proof mechanisms to large numbers of stakeholders, handling dynamic environments where strategic opportunities may evolve over time, and managing the tension between robustness against manipulation and the need for flexible, adaptive value learning. Key open questions involve developing mechanisms that remain effective under bounded rationality, managing the computational complexity of strategy-proof systems, and addressing the fundamental challenge of preference elicitation under strategic pressure.
