### Mini Description

Methods for combining and reconciling values and preferences from multiple sources, including approaches for handling conflicts and aggregating across different individuals or groups.

### Description

Multi-stakeholder Integration addresses the challenge of combining diverse and often conflicting values, preferences, and priorities from multiple individuals, groups, and entities into coherent decision-making frameworks for AI systems. This involves both theoretical frameworks for preference aggregation and practical mechanisms for balancing competing interests while maintaining fairness, legitimacy, and stability. Key challenges include handling strategic behavior, managing power dynamics, and ensuring representation of marginalized perspectives.

Current research explores various approaches including social choice theory, mechanism design, and collaborative filtering techniques adapted for value learning. These are complemented by work on preference elicitation protocols, deliberative democracy methods, and frameworks for measuring and promoting consensus. Particular attention is paid to handling incomplete or inconsistent preference information, managing different levels of expertise and engagement, and developing robust aggregation methods that remain stable under strategic manipulation.

Emerging areas of focus include dynamic preference updating mechanisms that can adapt to changing stakeholder compositions, methods for identifying and resolving fundamental value conflicts, and frameworks for managing different levels of stakeholder authority or influence. Critical open questions involve scaling these approaches to large stakeholder populations, handling inter-temporal stakeholder conflicts, and developing principled ways to weight different stakeholder inputs while maintaining system reliability and alignment.
