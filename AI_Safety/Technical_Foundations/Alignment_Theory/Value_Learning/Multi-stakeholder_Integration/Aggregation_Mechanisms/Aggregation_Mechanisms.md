### Mini Description

Mathematical frameworks and algorithms for combining multiple stakeholder preferences into coherent decision criteria, including voting systems, preference fusion, and collective choice rules.

### Description

Aggregation Mechanisms in multi-stakeholder value learning focus on the formal methods and computational frameworks for combining multiple preference structures into coherent decision criteria for AI systems. This includes both theoretical foundations from social choice theory and voting theory, as well as practical implementations that can handle real-world complexity, uncertainty, and scale. Core challenges include managing preference incompleteness, ensuring fairness and representation, and maintaining computational tractability as the number of stakeholders grows.

Current research explores various mathematical frameworks for preference aggregation, from classical approaches like Arrow's impossibility theorem and the Condorcet method to modern developments in probabilistic preference modeling and deep learning-based fusion techniques. Particular attention is paid to handling different types of preference information (cardinal, ordinal, categorical) and developing methods that can appropriately weight inputs based on factors like expertise, stake, or confidence while maintaining theoretical guarantees about the aggregation properties.

Emerging areas of investigation include dynamic aggregation mechanisms that can adapt to changing stakeholder compositions, hierarchical approaches that combine preferences at different levels of organization, and methods for maintaining coherence under preference updates or revisions. Key open questions involve developing scalable approaches that preserve desirable theoretical properties, managing the trade-off between expressiveness and computational efficiency, and designing mechanisms that remain robust under strategic behavior while promoting truthful preference revelation.
