    "title": "Efficient Preference Elicitation in Iterative Combinatorial Auctions with Many Participants",
    "published_date": "2024-03-28",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of achieving high efficiency in iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs). ICAs are a kind of combinatorial auction where the auctioneer interacts with bidders to gather their valuation information using a limited number of queries, aiming for efficient allocation. Preference elicitation, a process that incrementally asks bidders to value bundles while refining the outcome allocation, is a commonly used technique in ICAs. Recently, the integration of machine learning (ML) into ICAs has significantly improved preference elicitation. This approach employs ML models that match the number of bidders, estimating each bidder's valuation functions based on their reported valuations. However, most current studies train a separate model for each bidder, which can be inefficient when there are numerous bidders with similar valuation functions and a limited number of available queries. In this study, we introduce a multi-task learning method to learn valuation functions more efficiently. Specifically, we propose to share model parameters during training to grasp the intrinsic relationships between valuations. We assess the performance of our method using a spectrum auction simulator. The findings demonstrate that our method achieves higher efficiency than existing methods, especially in scenarios with many bidders and items but a limited number of queries.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a multi-task learning method for improving preference elicitation in iterative combinatorial auctions with many bidders, achieving higher efficiency than existing single-bidder models by sharing model parameters and leveraging similarities in bidder valuation functions. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations using a spectrum auction."

    "title": "Value Engineering for Autonomous Agents",
    "published_date": "2023-02-17",
    "abstract": "Machine Ethics (ME) is concerned with the design of Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs), i.e. autonomous agents capable of reasoning and behaving according to moral values. Previous approaches have treated values as labels associated with some actions or states of the world, rather than as integral components of agent reasoning. It is also common to disregard that a value-guided agent operates alongside other value-guided agents in an environment governed by norms, thus omitting the social dimension of AMAs. In this blue sky paper, we propose a new AMA paradigm grounded in moral and social psychology, where values are instilled into agents as context-dependent goals. These goals intricately connect values at individual levels to norms at a collective level by evaluating the outcomes most incentivized by the norms in place. We argue that this type of normative reasoning, where agents are endowed with an understanding of norms' moral implications, leads to value-awareness in autonomous agents. Additionally, this capability paves the way for agents to align the norms enforced in their societies with respect to the human values instilled in them, by complementing the value-based reasoning on norms with agreement mechanisms to help agents collectively agree on the best set of norms that suit their human values. Overall, our agent model goes beyond the treatment of values as inert labels by connecting them to normative reasoning and to the social functionalities needed to integrate value-aware agents into our modern hybrid human-computer societies.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a novel framework for designing Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs) that integrates moral values as context-dependent goals, connecting individual values to societal norms through normative reasoning and agreement mechanisms to achieve value-aware, socially integrated agents. This approach moves beyond treating values as simple labels, fostering alignment between agent behavior and human values within a shared social context."

    "title": "Learning Roles with Emergent Social Value Orientations",
    "published_date": "2023-01-31",
    "abstract": "Social dilemmas can be considered situations where individual rationality leads to collective irrationality. The multi-agent reinforcement learning community has leveraged ideas from social science, such as social value orientations (SVO), to solve social dilemmas in complex cooperative tasks. In this paper, by first introducing the typical\"division of labor or roles\"mechanism in human society, we provide a promising solution for intertemporal social dilemmas (ISD) with SVOs. A novel learning framework, called Learning Roles with Emergent SVOs (RESVO), is proposed to transform the learning of roles into the social value orientation emergence, which is symmetrically solved by endowing agents with altruism to share rewards with other agents. An SVO-based role embedding space is then constructed by individual conditioning policies on roles with a novel rank regularizer and mutual information maximizer. Experiments show that RESVO achieves a stable division of labor and cooperation in ISDs with different complexity.",

    "title": "Subjective-objective policy making approach: Coupling of resident-values multiple regression analysis with value-indices, multi-agent-based simulation",
    "published_date": "2023-06-14",
    "abstract": "Given the concerns around the existing subjective and objective policy evaluation approaches, this study proposes a new combined subjective-objective policy evaluation approach to choose better policy that reflects the will of citizens and is backed up by objective facts. Subjective approaches, such as the Life Satisfaction Approach and the Contingent Valuation Method, convert subjectivity into economic value, raising the question whether a higher economic value really accords with what citizens want. Objective policy evaluation approaches, such as Evidence Based Policy Making and Multi-Agent-Based Simulation, do not take subjectivity into account, making it difficult to choose from diverse and pluralistic candidate policies. The proposed approach establishes a subjective target function based on a multiple regression analysis of the results of a residents questionnaire survey, and uses MABS to calculate the objective evaluation indices for a number of candidate policies. Next, a new subjective-objective coupling target function, combining the explanatory variables of the subjective target function with objective evaluation indices, is set up, optimized to select the preferred policies from numerous candidates. To evaluate this approach, we conducted a verification of renewable energy introduction policies at Takaharu Town in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. The results show a good potential for using a new subjective-objective coupling target function to select policies consistent with the residents values for well-being from 20,000 policy candidates for social, ecological, and economic values obtained in MABS. Using the new approach to compare several policies enables concrete expression of the will of stakeholders with diverse values, and contributes to constructive discussions and consensus-building.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel policy evaluation approach combining subjective resident values (obtained via multiple regression analysis of survey data) with objective multi-agent-based simulation indices to select policies aligning with citizen preferences and objective facts. This method facilitates informed decision-making by integrating diverse stakeholder values and enabling constructive policy discussions."

    "title": "Composite Consensus-Building Process: Permissible Meeting Analysis and Compromise Choice Exploration",
    "published_date": "2022-11-16",
    "abstract": "In solving today's social issues, it is necessary to determine solutions that are acceptable to all stakeholders and collaborate to apply them. The conventional technology of\"permissive meeting analysis\"derives a consensusable choice that falls within everyone's permissible range through mathematical analyses; however, it tends to be biased toward the majority in a group, making it difficult to reach a consensus when a conflict arises. To support consensus building (defined here as an acceptable compromise that not everyone rejects), we developed a composite consensus-building process. The developed process addresses this issue by combining permissible meeting analysis with a new\"compromise choice-exploration\"technology, which presents a consensusable choice that emphasizes fairness and equality among everyone when permissible meeting analysis fails to do so. When both permissible meeting analysis and compromise choice exploration do not arrive at a consensus, a facility is provided to create a sublated choice among those provided by them. The trial experimental results confirmed that permissive meeting analysis and compromise choice exploration are sufficiently useful for deriving consensusable choices. Furthermore, we found that compromise choice exploration is characterized by its ability to derive choices that control the balance between compromise and fairness. Our proposed composite consensus-building approach could be applied in a wide range of situations, from local issues in municipalities and communities to international issues such as environmental protection and human rights issues. It could also aid in developing digital democracy and platform cooperativism.",
    "summary": "This paper introduces a composite consensus-building process that combines permissible meeting analysis with a novel compromise choice exploration method to achieve fairer and more equitable solutions, addressing the limitations of relying solely on majority-biased permissible meeting analysis. The process facilitates consensus even when initial analyses fail, offering a sublated choice as a final resort."

    "title": "Multi-criteria group decision-making method for green supplier selection based on distributed interval variables",
    "abstract": "Abstract Addressing the multi-criteria group decision making problem with interval attribute values and attribute weights, this paper proposes a decision method based on attribute distribution information. The selection of green suppliers is taken as an example for decision analysis. First, in the case of group decision-making, the quantitative values of the evaluation attributes of green suppliers are imputed by decision-makers, and the relevant distributions are constructed for each attribute. Next, combined with the ranges of attribute values, the random interval values are used to describe the information represented by each attribute to overcome the loss caused by the aggregation of individual expert information into group information. We then propose the distributed interval weighted arithmetic average (DIWAA) operator and corresponding operation rules, which realizes the fusion of qualitative data and quantitative judgment. Thus, the proposed approach allows ensuring reasonable results of the multi-criteria analysis. We also construct a ranking method for alternatives based on distributed interval comprehensive scores. Finally, we verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for the task of green supplier selection through numerical experiments.",

    "title": "Combining Reward Information from Multiple Sources",
    "published_date": "2021-03-22",
    "abstract": "Given two sources of evidence about a latent variable, one can combine the information from both by multiplying the likelihoods of each piece of evidence. However, when one or both of the observation models are misspecified, the distributions will conflict. We study this problem in the setting with two conflicting reward functions learned from different sources. In such a setting, we would like to retreat to a broader distribution over reward functions, in order to mitigate the effects of misspecification. We assume that an agent will maximize expected reward given this distribution over reward functions, and identify four desiderata for this setting. We propose a novel algorithm, Multitask Inverse Reward Design (MIRD), and compare it to a range of simple baselines. While all methods must trade off between conservatism and informativeness, through a combination of theory and empirical results on a toy environment, we find that MIRD and its variant MIRD-IF strike a good balance between the two.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the problem of combining conflicting reward signals from multiple sources by modeling a distribution over reward functions, rather than relying on a single, potentially misspecified, reward. The proposed algorithm, Multitask Inverse Reward Design (MIRD), balances conservatism and informativeness in handling this conflict, outperforming simpler baselines."

    "title": "Creating Value by Sharing Values: Managing Stakeholder Value Conflict in the Face of Pluralism through Discursive Justification",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The question of how to engage with stakeholders in situations of value conflict to create value that includes a plurality of conflicting stakeholder value perspectives represents one of the crucial current challenges of stakeholder engagement as well as of value creation stakeholder theory. To address this challenge, we conceptualize a discursive sharing process between affected stakeholders that is oriented toward discursive justification involving multiple procedural steps. This sharing process provides procedural guidance for firms and stakeholders to create pluralistic stakeholder value through the discursive accommodation of diverging stakeholder value perspectives. The outcomes of such a discursive value-sharing process range from stakeholder value dissensus to low (agreement to disagree) and increasing levels of stakeholder value congruence (value compromise) to stakeholder value consensus (shared values). Hence, this article contributes to the emerging literature on integrative stakeholder engagement by conceptualizing a procedural framework that is neither overly oriented towards dissensus nor consensus.",
