### Mini Description

Theoretical approaches for representing and reasoning about multiple moral theories simultaneously, including methods for combining different ethical frameworks and handling their interactions.

### Description

Meta-ethical frameworks in AI safety focus on developing formal systems for representing and reasoning about multiple moral theories simultaneously. These frameworks must address fundamental questions about how to structure and relate different ethical perspectives, handle conflicts between competing moral frameworks, and maintain coherence while acknowledging fundamental uncertainty about moral truth. This includes both theoretical work on the logical foundations of multi-theory moral reasoning and practical approaches for implementing such reasoning in AI systems.

A key challenge is the development of principled ways to compare and combine different moral theories, particularly when they operate on fundamentally different assumptions or use incompatible decision procedures. Researchers explore various approaches including moral parliament models, weighted utility combinations, and hierarchical moral frameworks. These must address issues like theory individuation (determining what counts as a distinct moral theory), theory comparison (how to relate different moral frameworks), and aggregation methods that respect the internal logic of each theory while enabling meaningful decision-making.

Current research emphasizes the development of frameworks that can handle both normative and metaethical uncertainty while remaining computationally tractable. This includes work on formal logic systems for moral reasoning, probabilistic approaches to ethical uncertainty, and methods for maintaining consistency across different levels of moral abstraction. Key open questions include how to handle theories with different levels of specificity, how to represent moral theories that reject consequentialist frameworks, and how to develop systems that can appropriately reason about their own moral uncertainty.
