### Mini Description

Computational methods for making decisions under moral uncertainty, including moral parliament approaches, expected moral value calculations, and various forms of uncertainty-aware action selection.

### Description

Decision procedures under moral uncertainty focus on developing systematic approaches for AI systems to select actions when faced with uncertainty about moral principles and ethical frameworks. This includes methods for comparing and aggregating different moral theories, handling incommensurable values, and determining appropriate courses of action when different ethical considerations suggest conflicting choices. Core challenges include developing principled ways to normalize across different moral frameworks, handling infinite or undefined expected values, and maintaining coherent decision-making under deep uncertainty.

Current approaches range from maximizing expected moral value across theories to more sophisticated mechanisms like moral parliament models, where different ethical frameworks are given proportional 'voting power' based on their credence. Researchers explore various aggregation methods, including approaches based on intertheoretic value comparisons, variance normalization, and maximin principles. There is particular focus on handling edge cases and ensuring robustness against moral fanaticism, where extreme possibilities dominate decision-making.

Key open questions include how to handle fundamentally incomparable moral theories, how to incorporate higher-order uncertainty about decision procedures themselves, and how to maintain reasonable behavior in novel situations. Recent work emphasizes developing hybrid approaches that combine multiple decision mechanisms, incorporating meta-preferences about how to handle uncertainty, and ensuring that decision procedures remain computationally tractable while scaling to handle complex real-world scenarios.
