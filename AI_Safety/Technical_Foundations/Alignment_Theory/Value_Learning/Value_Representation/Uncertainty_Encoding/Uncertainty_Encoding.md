### Mini Description

Methods for representing uncertainty in value judgments and preferences, including probabilistic approaches, belief distributions, and confidence measures.

### Description

Uncertainty Encoding in value representation focuses on developing formal methods to capture and represent various forms of uncertainty about values and preferences within AI systems. This includes uncertainty stemming from incomplete or conflicting human feedback, ambiguity in value learning, and inherent uncertainty about moral principles. The challenge extends beyond traditional probabilistic approaches, as value uncertainty often involves complex interdependencies and meta-level uncertainties about how to handle uncertainty itself.

A key consideration is the distinction between different types of uncertainty - aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the stochastic nature of preferences, epistemic uncertainty due to limited information or knowledge, and moral uncertainty about fundamental value judgments. Research explores various mathematical frameworks including probability theory, possibility theory, and imprecise probabilities, as well as hybrid approaches that can capture qualitatively different forms of uncertainty simultaneously.

Current work emphasizes the need for computationally tractable representations that can support decision-making under uncertainty while maintaining interpretability and allowing for uncertainty updates as new information becomes available. This includes developing methods for propagating uncertainty through value-based reasoning systems, techniques for conservative decision-making under high uncertainty, and approaches for active uncertainty reduction through targeted information gathering.
