    "abstract": "Machine Ethics (ME) is concerned with the design of Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs), i.e. autonomous agents capable of reasoning and behaving according to moral values. Previous approaches have treated values as labels associated with some actions or states of the world, rather than as integral components of agent reasoning. It is also common to disregard that a value-guided agent operates alongside other value-guided agents in an environment governed by norms, thus omitting the social dimension of AMAs. In this blue sky paper, we propose a new AMA paradigm grounded in moral and social psychology, where values are instilled into agents as context-dependent goals. These goals intricately connect values at individual levels to norms at a collective level by evaluating the outcomes most incentivized by the norms in place. We argue that this type of normative reasoning, where agents are endowed with an understanding of norms' moral implications, leads to value-awareness in autonomous agents. Additionally, this capability paves the way for agents to align the norms enforced in their societies with respect to the human values instilled in them, by complementing the value-based reasoning on norms with agreement mechanisms to help agents collectively agree on the best set of norms that suit their human values. Overall, our agent model goes beyond the treatment of values as inert labels by connecting them to normative reasoning and to the social functionalities needed to integrate value-aware agents into our modern hybrid human-computer societies.",

    "title": "A computational framework of human values for ethical AI",
    "published_date": "2023-05-04",
    "abstract": "In the diverse array of work investigating the nature of human values from psychology, philosophy and social sciences, there is a clear consensus that values guide behaviour. More recently, a recognition that values provide a means to engineer ethical AI has emerged. Indeed, Stuart Russell proposed shifting AI's focus away from simply ``intelligence'' towards intelligence ``provably aligned with human values''. This challenge -- the value alignment problem -- with others including an AI's learning of human values, aggregating individual values to groups, and designing computational mechanisms to reason over values, has energised a sustained research effort. Despite this, no formal, computational definition of values has yet been proposed. We address this through a formal conceptual framework rooted in the social sciences, that provides a foundation for the systematic, integrated and interdisciplinary investigation into how human values can support designing ethical AI.",

    "title": "A General Framework for the Representation of Function and Affordance: A Cognitive, Causal, and Grounded Approach, and a Step Toward AGI",
    "published_date": "2022-06-02",
    "abstract": "The function and affordance of natural or artificial objects and various physical constructs feature prominently in the functioning of an intelligent system or an intelligent autonomous system (IAS). In navigating an environment, an IAS needs to understand the function and affordance of roads, stairs, bridges, and various physical constructs that may assist with or obstruct its movement to achieve its goal(s). When encountering objects, understanding their function and affordance so that they may be manipulated or made use of to support the IAS in performing certain required tasks is a key aspect of the intelligent functioning of the IAS. In AI research, so far, the attention paid to the characterization and representation of function and affordance has been sporadic and sparse, and it has not received the same attention as, say, object categorization or natural language processing, even though this aspect features prominently in an intelligent system's functioning, and is more fundamental and important in many ways. In the sporadic and sparse, though commendable efforts so far devoted to the characterization and understanding of function and affordance, there has also been no general framework that could unify all the different use domains and situations related to functionality, and that could provide an intelligent system or an IAS the necessary computational, representational, processing, and reasoning constructs to effect recognition, generation, and application of functional concepts. This paper develops just such a general framework, with an approach that emphasizes the fact that the representations involved must be explicitly cognitive and conceptual, and they must also contain the causal characterizations of the events and processes involved, as well as employ conceptual constructs that are grounded in the referents to which they refer, in order to achieve maximal generality for the framework to be applicable to a wide range of domains and situations. The basic general framework is described, along with a set of basic guiding principles with regards to representation of functionality. To properly and adequately characterize and represent functionality, a descriptive representation language is needed. This language is defined and developed, and many examples of its use are described. The general framework is developed based on an extension of the general language meaning representational framework called conceptual dependency. To support the general characterization and representation of functionality, the basic conceptual dependency framework is enhanced with representational devices called structure anchor and conceptual dependency elaboration, together with the definition of a set of ground level concepts. These novel representational constructs are defined, developed, and described. A general framework dealing with functionality would represent a major step toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence.",

    "title": "Scales and Hedges in a Logic with Analogous Semantics",
    "published_date": "2022-01-21",
    "abstract": "Logics with analogous semantics, such as Fuzzy Logic, have a number of explanatory and application advantages, the most well-known being the ability to help experts develop control systems. From a cognitive systems perspective, such languages also have the advantage of being grounded in perception. For social decision making in humans, it is vital that logical conclusions about others (cognitive empathy) are grounded in empathic emotion (affective empathy). Classical Fuzzy Logic, however, has several disadvantages: it is not obvious how complex formulae, e.g., the description of events in a text, can be (a) formed, (b) grounded, and (c) used in logical reasoning. The two-layered Context Logic (CL) was designed to address these issue. Formally based on a lattice semantics, like classical Fuzzy Logic, CL also features an analogous semantics for complex fomulae. With the Activation Bit Vector Machine (ABVM), it has a simple and classical logical reasoning mechanism with an inherent imagery process based on the Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) model of distributed neuronal processing. This paper adds to the existing theory how scales, as necessary for adjective and verb semantics can be handled by the system.",

    "title": "Value Creation Framework Based on Designable Evaluation Network",
    "abstract": "Social innovation is an attempt to solve various social problems. It requires the creation of new value in a local community. However, a concrete method for creating new value in a local community is yet to be established. Therefore, in our study, we aim to construct a framework for creating new value in the local community by designing a social support system of the local community. To construct such a framework, we propose a designable evaluation network (DEN), which is a social network that expresses the evaluation relationship between people/artifacts and people/artifacts in a local community as a network structure. Moreover, the evaluation relationship in a DEN is formed through a designable evaluation model, which is a mathematical model with designability. It is possible to construct a framework by designing a social support system on a computer using a DEN and conducting operations to create new value for a local community.",

    "title": "Value driven Analysis Framework of Service Ecosystem Evolution Mechanism",
    "published_date": "2020-07-09",
    "abstract": "With the development of cloud computing, service computing, IoT(Internet of Things) and mobile Internet, the diversity and sociality of services are increasingly apparent. To meet the customized user demands, Service Ecosystem is emerging as a complex social-technology system, which is formed with various IT services through cross-border integration. However, how to analyze and promote the evolution mechanism of service ecosystem is still a serious challenge in the field, which is of great significance to achieve the expected system evolution trends. Based on this, this paper proposes a value-driven analysis framework of service ecosystem, including value creation, value operation, value realization and value distribution. In addition, a computational experiment system is established to verify the effectiveness of the analysis framework, which stimulates the effect of different operation strategies on the value network in the service ecosystem. The result shows that our analysis framework can provide new means and ideas for the analysis of service ecosystem evolution, and can also support the design of operation strategies. Index",
