### Mini Description

Languages and formalisms for expressing specifications under uncertainty, including probabilistic logics and stochastic process calculi.

### Description

Probabilistic Frameworks in AI safety specification focus on developing formal languages and mathematical structures for expressing uncertainty and stochastic behavior in AI system requirements. These frameworks must handle various forms of uncertainty - from aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the environment to epistemic uncertainty about human values and preferences. Key challenges include maintaining tractable inference while capturing complex probabilistic dependencies and temporal relationships.

Current approaches range from probabilistic programming languages that enable direct specification of generative models to modal logics extended with probability operators. Researchers are particularly focused on frameworks that can express safety properties under uncertainty, such as probabilistic guarantees of constraint satisfaction, risk-bounded behavior, and robust performance under distribution shift. This includes developing semantics for concepts like probabilistic refinement, stochastic dominance, and expected utility specifications.

A central research challenge is creating frameworks that can handle nested uncertainty and higher-order probability distributions, which arise when reasoning about uncertain specifications or learning from uncertain human feedback. This connects to questions of how to formally express uncertainty over utility functions, specify probabilistic bounds on impact measures, and maintain meaningful safety guarantees under uncertainty about the system's operational domain. Researchers also investigate methods for compositional reasoning with probabilistic specifications and techniques for verifying probabilistic properties efficiently.
