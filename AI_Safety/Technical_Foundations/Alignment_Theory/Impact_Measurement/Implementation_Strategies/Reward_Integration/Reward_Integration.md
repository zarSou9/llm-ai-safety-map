### Mini Description

Methods for incorporating impact measurements into reward functions and optimization objectives, including impact penalties, constrained optimization, and multi-objective approaches.

### Description

Reward Integration focuses on methods for incorporating impact measurements into the core optimization objectives and reward structures of AI systems. This involves developing mathematical frameworks that combine task-specific rewards with impact-related penalties or constraints in ways that lead to desired behavior. Key challenges include balancing the relative weights of different objectives, preventing reward hacking of the combined objective, and ensuring the integrated reward signal remains learnable.

Current approaches span from simple linear combinations of reward terms to more sophisticated methods like constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and multi-objective reinforcement learning. Researchers are particularly focused on developing integration methods that preserve the interpretability of both components, handle uncertainty in impact measurements appropriately, and maintain desired properties like monotonicity and bounded regret. This includes work on reward shaping techniques that guide learning towards impact-aware behaviors, and methods for dynamically adjusting the influence of impact terms based on context or confidence.

A central challenge is ensuring that the integrated reward function remains well-behaved as systems become more capable. This involves addressing problems like reward scaling across different types of impacts, managing potential conflicts between task and impact objectives, and preventing systems from finding degenerate solutions that optimize one component at the expense of the other. Recent work explores methods for learning appropriate trade-off functions from human feedback and developing theoretical frameworks for composing reward functions that maintain desired properties.
