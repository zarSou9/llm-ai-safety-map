    "title": "From Utilitarian to Rawlsian Designs for Algorithmic Fairness",
    "published_date": "2023-02-07",
    "abstract": "There is a lack of consensus within the literature as to how `fairness' of algorithmic systems can be measured, and different metrics can often be at odds. In this paper, we approach this task by drawing on the ethical frameworks of utilitarianism and John Rawls. Informally, these two theories of distributive justice measure the `good' as either a population's sum of utility, or worst-off outcomes, respectively. We present a parameterized class of objective functions that interpolates between these two (possibly) conflicting notions of the `good'. This class is shown to represent a relaxation of the Rawlsian `veil of ignorance', and its sequence of optimal solutions converges to both a utilitarian and Rawlsian optimum. Several other properties of this class are studied, including: 1) a relationship to regularized optimization, 2) feasibility of consistent estimation, and 3) algorithmic cost. In several real-world datasets, we compute optimal solutions and construct the tradeoff between utilitarian and Rawlsian notions of the `good'. Empirically, we demonstrate that increasing model complexity can manifest strict improvements to both measures of the `good'. This work suggests that the proper degree of `fairness' can be informed by a designer's preferences over the space of induced utilitarian and Rawlsian `good'."

    "title": "Welfare Measure for Resource Allocation with Algorithmic Implementation: Beyond Average and Max-Min",
    "published_date": "2021-04-16",
    "abstract": "In this work, we propose an axiomatic approach for measuring the performance/welfare of a system consisting of concurrent agents in a resource-driven system. Our approach provides a unifying view on popular system optimality principles, such as the maximal average/total utilities and the max-min fairness. Moreover, it gives rise to other system optimality notions that have not been fully exploited yet, such as the maximal lowest total subgroup utilities. For the axiomatically defined welfare measures, we provide a generic gradient-based method to find an optimal resource allocation and present a theoretical guarantee for its success. Lastly, we demonstrate the power of our approach through the power control application in wireless networks."

    "title": "Fairness through Social Welfare Optimization",
    "published_date": "2021-01-30",
    "abstract": "We propose social welfare optimization as a general paradigm for formalizing fairness in AI systems. We argue that optimization models allow formulation of a wide range of fairness criteria as social welfare functions, while enabling AI to take advantage of highly advanced solution technology. Rather than attempting to reduce bias between selected groups, one can achieve equity across all groups by incorporating fairness into the social welfare function. This also allows a fuller accounting of the welfare of the individuals involved. We show how to integrate social welfare optimization with both rule-based AI and machine learning, using either an in-processing or a post-processing approach. We present empirical results from a case study as a preliminary examination of the validity and potential of these integration strategies.",

    "title": "Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Risk Modelling",
    "published_date": "2021-07-01",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem where a modeller conducts sensitivity analysis of a model consisting of random input factors, a corresponding random output of interest, and a baseline probability measure. The modeller seeks to understand how the model (the distribution of the input factors as well as the output) changes under a stress on the output's distribution. Specifically, for a stress on the output random variable, we derive the unique stressed distribution of the output that is closest in the Wasserstein distance to the baseline output's distribution and satisfies the stress. We further derive the stressed model, including the stressed distribution of the inputs, which can be calculated in a numerically efficient way from a set of baseline Monte Carlo samples and which is implemented in the \\({\\texttt{R}}\\) package \\({\\texttt{SWIM}}\\) on \\({\\texttt{CRAN}}\\). The proposed reverse sensitivity analysis framework is model-free and allows for stresses on the output such as (a) the mean and variance, (b) any distortion risk measure including the Value-at-Risk and Expected-Shortfall, and (c) expected utility type constraints, thus making the reverse sensitivity analysis framework suitable for risk models.",

    "title": "Analysis of Academic Literature on Environmental Valuation",
    "abstract": "Environmental valuation refers to a variety of techniques to assign monetary values to environmental impacts, especially non-market impacts. It has experienced a steady growth in the number of publications on the subject in the last 30 years. We performed a search for papers containing the term “environmental valuation” in the title, abstract, or keywords. The search was conducted with an online literature search engine of the Web of Science (WoS) electronic databases. A search of this database revealed that the term “environmental valuation” appeared for the first time in 1987. Since then a large number of studies have been published, including significant breakthroughs in theory and applications. In the present work 661 publications were selected for a review of the literature on environmental valuation over the period 1987–2019. This paper analyzes the evolution of the leading methodologies and authors, highlights the preference for the choice experiment method over the contingent valuation method, and shows that relatively few papers have had a strong impact on the researchers in this area.",

    "title": "Balancing Fairness and Efficiency in an Optimization Model",
    "published_date": "2020-06-10",
    "abstract": "Optimization models generally aim for efficiency by maximizing total benefit or minimizing cost. Yet a trade-off between fairness and efficiency is an important element of many practical decisions. We propose a principled and practical method for balancing these two criteria in an optimization model. Following a critical assessment of existing schemes, we define a set of social welfare functions (SWFs) that combine Rawlsian leximax fairness and utilitarianism and overcome some of the weaknesses of previous approaches. In particular, we regulate the equity/efficiency trade-off with a single parameter that has a meaningful interpretation in practical contexts. We formulate the SWFs using mixed integer constraints and sequentially maximize them subject to constraints that define the problem at hand. After providing practical step-by-step instructions for implementation, we demonstrate the method on problems of realistic size involving healthcare resource allocation and disaster preparation. The solution times are modest, ranging from a fraction of a second to 18 seconds for a given value of the trade-off parameter.",
