### Mini Description

Approaches that attempt to create common units or scales for comparing different types of impacts, including methods for aggregating multiple impact dimensions.

### Description

Utility-Theoretic Frameworks in AI impact measurement focus on developing systematic approaches to express different types of impacts in terms of comparable units or scales. These frameworks draw from economic utility theory and decision theory to create mathematical structures that can aggregate multiple impact dimensions into coherent measurements. The core challenge lies in developing principled ways to trade off different types of impacts while maintaining meaningful comparisons and avoiding arbitrary or problematic weightings.

Current approaches explore various foundations for utility construction, from preference-based methods that attempt to learn or infer appropriate utility functions from human judgments, to axiomatic approaches that derive utility measures from fundamental principles about impact comparison. Key technical challenges include handling non-linear interactions between different impact types, managing uncertainty in both measurement and aggregation, and ensuring the resulting utility functions remain well-behaved under composition or scaling.

Research particularly focuses on addressing known limitations of traditional utility theory when applied to AI impact measurement, such as the difficulty of maintaining transitivity across very different types of impacts, or the challenge of avoiding implicit assumptions that could lead to undesirable optimization behavior. This includes work on bounded utility functions, lexicographic preferences, and multi-criteria decision frameworks that can maintain meaningful distinctions between fundamentally different types of impacts while still enabling practical comparison and decision-making.
