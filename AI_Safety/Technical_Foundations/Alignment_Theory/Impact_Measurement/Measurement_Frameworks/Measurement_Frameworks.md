### Mini Description

Theoretical approaches to defining and combining different types of impact metrics, including information-theoretic, conservation-based, and utility-based frameworks.

### Description

Measurement Frameworks in AI impact assessment focus on developing systematic approaches to quantify and compare different types of impacts in a principled way. These frameworks provide the theoretical foundation for how we conceptualize, aggregate, and evaluate the various effects of AI systems on their environment. Key challenges include developing metrics that are both mathematically rigorous and practically meaningful, while avoiding problems like incomparability between different types of impacts or hidden optimization pressures.

Current approaches broadly fall into three categories: information-theoretic frameworks that measure impact through changes in state space or attainable states, conservation-based frameworks that focus on maintaining invariants or limiting irreversible changes, and utility-theoretic frameworks that attempt to create common units for comparing different types of impacts. Each approach offers different tradeoffs between computational tractability, interpretability, and completeness of measurement. Research particularly focuses on developing frameworks that can handle uncertainty, maintain coherence under composition, and appropriately scale with system capability.

Open challenges include developing frameworks that can meaningfully combine both qualitative and quantitative impacts, handle emergent effects in complex systems, and appropriately weight different types of impacts without introducing problematic optimization incentives. There is particular interest in frameworks that can maintain reliability under distribution shift and handle novel situations while remaining grounded in human-interpretable concepts. This includes work on axiomatic approaches to impact measurement and formal methods for combining multiple measurement paradigms.
