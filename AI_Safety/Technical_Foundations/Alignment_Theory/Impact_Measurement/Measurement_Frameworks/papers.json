    "title": "Comparison of Sustainable Development Goals Labeling Systems based on Topic Coverage",
    "published_date": "2024-08-24",
    "abstract": "With the growing importance of sustainable development goals (SDGs), various labeling systems have emerged for effective monitoring and evaluation. This study assesses six labeling systems across 1.85 million documents at both paper level and topic level. Our findings indicate that the SDGO and SDSN systems are more aggressive, while systems such as Auckland, Aurora, SIRIS, and Elsevier exhibit significant topic consistency, with similarity scores exceeding 0.75 for most SDGs. However, similarities at the paper level generally fall short, particularly for specific SDGs like SDG 10. We highlight the crucial role of contextual information in keyword-based labeling systems, noting that overlooking context can introduce bias in the retrieval of papers (e.g., variations in\"migration\"between biomedical and geographical contexts). These results reveal substantial discrepancies among SDG labeling systems, emphasizing the need for improved methodologies to enhance the accuracy and relevance of SDG evaluations.",

    "title": "Algorithms for Multi-Criteria Decision-Making and Efficiency Analysis Problems",
    "published_date": "2024-06-10",
    "abstract": "Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems involve the evaluation of alternatives based on various minimization and maximization criteria. Similarly, efficiency evaluation (EA) methods assess decision-making units (DMUs) by analyzing their input consumption and output production. MCDM and EA methods face challenges in managing alternatives and DMUs with varying capacities across different criteria (inputs and outputs). That leads to performance assessments often skewed by subjective biases in criteria weighting. We introduce two innovative scenarios utilizing linear programming-based Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models to address these limitations. This dual-scenario approach aims to mitigate traditional biases, offering robust solutions for comprehensively assessing alternatives and DMUs. Our methodology allows for the influential ranking of alternatives in MCDM problems and enables each DMU to adjust its input and output ratios to achieve efficiency.",

    "title": "Fundamental limits for sensor-based robot control",
    "published_date": "2022-01-31",
    "abstract": "Our goal is to develop theory and algorithms for establishing fundamental limits on performance imposed by a robot's sensors for a given task. In order to achieve this, we define a quantity that captures the amount of task-relevant information provided by a sensor. Using a novel version of the generalized Fano's inequality from information theory, we demonstrate that this quantity provides an upper bound on the highest achievable expected reward for one-step decision-making tasks. We then extend this bound to multi-step problems via a dynamic programming approach. We present algorithms for numerically computing the resulting bounds, and demonstrate our approach on three examples: (i) the lava problem from the literature on partially observable Markov decision processes, (ii) an example with continuous state and observation spaces corresponding to a robot catching a freely-falling object, and (iii) obstacle avoidance using a depth sensor with non-Gaussian noise. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to establish strong limits on achievable performance for these problems by comparing our upper bounds with achievable lower bounds (computed by synthesizing or learning concrete control policies).",

    "title": "Melding wildlife surveys to improve conservation inference",
    "published_date": "2022-11-23",
    "abstract": "Integrated models are a popular tool for analyzing species of conservation concern. Species of conservation concern are often monitored by multiple entities that generate several datasets. Individually, these datasets may be insufficient for guiding management due to low spatio‐temporal resolution, biased sampling, or large observational uncertainty. Integrated models provide an approach for assimilating multiple datasets in a coherent framework that can compensate for these deficiencies. While conventional integrated models have been used to assimilate count data with surveys of survival, fecundity, and harvest, they can also assimilate ecological surveys that have differing spatio‐temporal regions and observational uncertainties. Motivated by independent aerial and ground surveys of lesser prairie‐chicken, we developed an integrated modeling approach that assimilates density estimates derived from surveys with distinct sources of observational error into a joint framework that provides shared inference on spatio‐temporal trends. We model these data using a Bayesian Markov melding approach and apply several data augmentation strategies for efficient sampling. In a simulation study, we show that our integrated model improved predictive performance relative to models for analyzing the surveys independently. We use the integrated model to facilitate prediction of lesser prairie‐chicken density at unsampled regions and perform a sensitivity analysis to quantify the inferential cost associated with reduced survey effort.",

    "title": "Analysing constraints to improve conservation decision-making: a theoretical framework and its application to the Northern Vosges, France",
    "abstract": "Summary Key to bridging knowing–doing gaps is analysis of the constraints binding interactions between decision-makers and conservation biologists to clarify the problems they address. We apply this analysis to decision situations in the Northern Vosges (France), which illustrate three kinds of constraints: governance, framework and initiative. We explore how conservation biologists can mitigate constraints so as to foster more ambitious conservation actions in each case. The first case explores attempts at reintroducing the lynx (Lynx lynx). In this case, we show that governance plays a key role, in the sense that conservation actions should focus on improving the acceptability of reintroductions to key stakeholders. The second case refers to water monitoring schemes. Here we show that framing is the dominant constraint. This means that conservation actions are tightly limited by the use of a restrictive scientific apparatus. The last case study, fish stock protection, is constrained by initiative. Here, decision-makers have too much leverage to implement solutions they favour, even if they are not the best options in conservation terms. Exploring how our framework relates to the existing literature allows us to highlight its usefulness for rationalizing conservation problem framing and for strengthening the ambitions of conservation actions.",

    "title": "SustainBench: Benchmarks for Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with Machine Learning",
    "published_date": "2021-11-08",
    "abstract": "Progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been hindered by a lack of data on key environmental and socioeconomic indicators, which historically have come from ground surveys with sparse temporal and spatial coverage. Recent advances in machine learning have made it possible to utilize abundant, frequently-updated, and globally available data, such as from satellites or social media, to provide insights into progress toward SDGs. Despite promising early results, approaches to using such data for SDG measurement thus far have largely evaluated on different datasets or used inconsistent evaluation metrics, making it hard to understand whether performance is improving and where additional research would be most fruitful. Furthermore, processing satellite and ground survey data requires domain knowledge that many in the machine learning community lack. In this paper, we introduce SustainBench, a collection of 15 benchmark tasks across 7 SDGs, including tasks related to economic development, agriculture, health, education, water and sanitation, climate action, and life on land. Datasets for 11 of the 15 tasks are released publicly for the first time. Our goals for SustainBench are to (1) lower the barriers to entry for the machine learning community to contribute to measuring and achieving the SDGs; (2) provide standard benchmarks for evaluating machine learning models on tasks across a variety of SDGs; and (3) encourage the development of novel machine learning methods where improved model performance facilitates progress towards the SDGs.",

    "published_date": "2021-11-06",
    "abstract": "Difficulties identifying appropriate biodiversity impact metrics remain a major barrier to inclusion of biodiversity considerations in environmentally responsible investment. We propose and analyse a simple science-based local metric: the sum of proportional changes in local species abundances relative to their global species abundances, with a correction for species close to extinction. As we show, this metric quantifies changes in the mean long-term global survival probability of species. It links mathematically to a widely cited global biodiversity indicator, the Living Planet Index, for which we propose an improved formula that directly addresses the known problem of singularities caused by extinctions. We show that, in an ideal market, trade in our metric would lead to near-optimal allocation of resources to species conservation. We further show that the metric is closely related to several other metrics and indices already in use. Barriers to adoption are therefore low. Used in conjunction with metrics addressing ecosystem functioning and services, potential areas of application include biodiversity related financial disclosures and voluntary or legislated no net biodiversity loss policies.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "The paper proposes a new metric for tradable biodiversity credits, calculated as the sum of proportional changes in local species abundances relative to global abundances, corrected for extinction risk, which effectively quantifies changes in species' long-term survival probability and links to the Living Planet Index. This metric facilitates efficient resource allocation for species conservation and is readily applicable to various financial and policy contexts."
