### Mini Description

Frameworks for measuring direct impacts on other agents in the environment, including changes to their decision-making context, available options, or immediate welfare.

### Description

Immediate Agent Effects focuses on quantifying and analyzing how AI system actions directly impact other agents - both human and artificial - in their shared environment. This includes measuring changes to agent decision-making contexts, alterations in available action spaces, and immediate effects on agent welfare or capability. The core challenge lies in developing frameworks that can capture these impacts while accounting for the diverse ways agents can be affected and the potential heterogeneity in agent types and preferences.

Current research approaches include utility-based measurements that attempt to quantify changes in agent welfare, capability-focused metrics that track modifications to agent action spaces, and interaction-based frameworks that analyze changes in strategic dynamics between agents. Particular attention is given to developing methods that can handle asymmetric impacts, where actions may affect different agents in varying ways, and to creating metrics that remain meaningful across different types of agents and interaction contexts.

Key open challenges include developing robust methods for aggregating impacts across heterogeneous agents, handling uncertainty in agent preferences and capabilities, and creating frameworks that can appropriately measure impacts in dynamic multi-agent systems. There is also significant work needed on methods for measuring impacts that may not be immediately visible but manifest through rapid changes in agent behavior or decision-making processes.
