### Mini Description

Methods for analyzing how AI systems affect institutional structures, decision-making processes, and power dynamics within organizations and societies.

### Description

Institutional Impact Tracking examines how AI systems influence and reshape organizational structures, governance mechanisms, and decision-making processes across different scales of human institutions. This includes studying how AI deployment affects power dynamics, accountability mechanisms, organizational learning, and the evolution of institutional norms and practices. The field combines insights from organizational theory, institutional economics, and complex systems analysis to develop frameworks for measuring and predicting these transformational effects.

A central challenge lies in developing metrics and methodologies that can capture both quantitative and qualitative changes in institutional functioning. This includes tracking shifts in decision-making authority, changes in information flows, alterations to incentive structures, and evolving patterns of institutional adaptation. Researchers must account for different institutional contexts, varying levels of AI integration, and the potential for both gradual evolution and sudden phase transitions in institutional arrangements.

Current research emphasizes the need to understand both formal and informal institutional changes, including how AI systems affect organizational culture, professional roles, and patterns of collaboration. This involves studying how institutions develop new coordination mechanisms, adapt their monitoring and control systems, and evolve their organizational boundaries in response to AI capabilities. Particular attention is paid to feedback loops between institutional changes and AI system behavior, as well as the emergence of new institutional forms specifically adapted to AI-driven environments.
