### Mini Description

Approaches for identifying and evaluating potential cascading failures, tipping points, and other systemic risks that could arise from AI deployment.

### Description

Systemic Risk Assessment in AI safety focuses on identifying and evaluating potential large-scale failures that could emerge from the complex interactions between AI systems and the broader socio-technical environment. This includes analyzing potential cascade effects, feedback loops, and critical transitions that could lead to widespread disruption or harm. The field draws on methods from complex systems theory, network science, and risk analysis to model how local perturbations might amplify into system-wide failures.

Key research challenges include developing methods to identify early warning signals of impending systemic failures, characterizing the stability and resilience of AI-integrated systems, and understanding how different failure modes might interact or compound. This involves both theoretical work on modeling complex adaptive systems and practical approaches to monitoring and measuring system-level risk indicators. Particular attention is paid to potential hidden vulnerabilities, common mode failures, and emergence of unexpected behaviors at scale.

Current approaches emphasize the importance of multi-model analysis, combining insights from different theoretical frameworks and empirical observations to build more robust understanding of systemic risks. Researchers are developing new methodologies for stress testing AI systems under various scenarios, identifying critical dependencies and potential points of failure, and designing early intervention strategies. This includes work on formal methods for stability analysis, empirical studies of historical systemic failures, and development of risk metrics that can capture complex interdependencies.
