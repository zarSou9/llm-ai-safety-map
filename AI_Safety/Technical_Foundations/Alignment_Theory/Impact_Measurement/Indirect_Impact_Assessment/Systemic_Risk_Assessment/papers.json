    "published_date": "2024-09-13",
    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models may carry societal transformation to an extent demanding a delicate balance between opportunity and risk. This manuscript is the first of a series of White Papers informing the development of IEEE-SA's p3995: `Standard for the Implementation of Safeguards, Controls, and Preventive Techniques for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Models', Chair: Marina Cort\\^{e}s (https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/3395/11378/). In this first horizon-scanning we identify key attention areas for standards activities in AI. We examine different principles for regulatory efforts, and review notions of accountability, privacy, data rights and mis-use. As a safeguards standard we devote significant attention to the stability of global infrastructures and consider a possible overdependence on cloud computing that may result from densely coupled AI components. We review the recent cascade-failure-like Crowdstrike event in July 2024, as an illustration of potential impacts on critical infrastructures from AI-induced incidents in the (near) future. It is the first of a set of articles intended as White Papers informing the audience on the standard development. Upcoming articles will focus on regulatory initiatives, technology evolution and the role of AI in specific domains."

    "title": "Broadening the perspective for sustainable AI: Comprehensive sustainability criteria and indicators for AI systems",
    "published_date": "2023-06-22",
    "abstract": "The increased use of AI systems is associated with multi-faceted societal, environmental, and economic consequences. These include non-transparent decision-making processes, discrimination, increasing inequalities, rising energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in AI model development and application, and an increasing concentration of economic power. By considering the multi-dimensionality of sustainability, this paper takes steps towards substantiating the call for an overarching perspective on\"sustainable AI\". It presents the SCAIS Framework (Sustainability Criteria and Indicators for Artificial Intelligence Systems) which contains a set 19 sustainability criteria for sustainable AI and 67 indicators that is based on the results of a critical review and expert workshops. This interdisciplinary approach contributes a unique holistic perspective to facilitate and structure the discourse on sustainable AI. Further, it provides a concrete framework that lays the foundation for developing standards and tools to support the conscious development and application of AI systems.",

    "title": "TASRA: a Taxonomy and Analysis of Societal-Scale Risks from AI",
    "published_date": "2023-06-12",
    "abstract": "While several recent works have identified societal-scale and extinction-level risks to humanity arising from artificial intelligence, few have attempted an {\\em exhaustive taxonomy} of such risks. Many exhaustive taxonomies are possible, and some are useful -- particularly if they reveal new risks or practical approaches to safety. This paper explores a taxonomy based on accountability: whose actions lead to the risk, are the actors unified, and are they deliberate? We also provide stories to illustrate how the various risk types could each play out, including risks arising from unanticipated interactions of many AI systems, as well as risks from deliberate misuse, for which combined technical and policy solutions are indicated.",

    "title": "Bridging the Global Divide in AI Regulation: A Proposal for a Contextual, Coherent, and Commensurable Framework",
    "published_date": "2023-03-20",
    "abstract": "As debates on potential societal harm from artificial intelligence (AI) culminate in legislation and international norms, a global divide is emerging in both AI regulatory frameworks and international governance structures. In terms of local regulatory frameworks, the European Union (E.U.), Canada, and Brazil follow a horizontal or lateral approach that postulates the homogeneity of AI, seeks to identify common causes of harm, and demands uniform human interventions. In contrast, the United States (U.S.), the United Kingdom (U.K.), Israel, and Switzerland (and potentially China) have pursued a context-specific or modular approach, tailoring regulations to the specific use cases of AI systems. This paper argues for a context-specific approach to effectively address evolving risks in diverse mission-critical domains, while avoiding social costs associated with one-size-fits-all approaches. However, to enhance the systematicity and interoperability of international norms and accelerate global harmonization, this paper proposes an alternative contextual, coherent, and commensurable (3C) framework. To ensure contextuality, the framework (i) bifurcates the AI life cycle into two phases: learning and deployment for specific tasks, instead of defining foundation or general-purpose models; and (ii) categorizes these tasks based on their application and interaction with humans as follows: autonomous, discriminative (allocative, punitive, and cognitive), and generative AI. To ensure coherency, each category is assigned specific regulatory objectives replacing 2010s vintage AI ethics. To ensure commensurability, the framework promotes the adoption of international standards for measuring and mitigating risks.",
