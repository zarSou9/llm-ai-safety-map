    "title": "A responsibility value for digraphs",
    "published_date": "2023-01-06",
    "abstract": "There is an increasing need to hold players responsible for negative or positive impact that take place elsewhere in a value chain or a network. For example, countries or companies are held more and more responsible for their indirect carbon emissions. We introduce a responsibility value that allocates the total impact of the value chain among the players, taking into account their direct impact and their indirect impact through the underlying graph. Moreover, we show that the responsibility value satisfies a set of natural yet important properties.",
    "summary": "This paper introduces a responsibility value for digraphs, quantifying the impact of players in a network by considering both their direct and indirect contributions, satisfying several desirable properties."

    "title": "Goal oriented indicators for food systems based on FAIR data",
    "published_date": "2023-02-20",
    "abstract": "Throughout the food supply chain, between production, transportation, packaging, and green employment, a plethora of indicators cover the environmental footprint and resource use. By defining and tracking the more inefficient practices of the food supply chain and their effects, we can better understand how to improve agricultural performance, track nutrition values, and focus on the reduction of a major risk to the environment while contributing to food security. Our aim is to propose a framework for a food supply chain, devoted to the vision of zero waste and zero emissions, and at the same time, fulfilling the broad commitment on inclusive green economy within the climate action. To set the groundwork for a smart city solution which achieves this vision, main indicators and evaluation frameworks are introduced, followed by the drill down into most crucial problems, both globally and locally, in a case study in north Italy. Methane is on the rise in the climate agenda, and specifically in Italy emission mitigation is difficult to achieve in the farming sector. Accordingly, going from the generic frameworks towards a federation deployment, we provide the reasoning for a cost-effective use case in the domain of food, to create a valuable digital twin. A Bayesian approach to assess use cases and select preferred scenarios is proposed, realizing the potential of the digital twin flexibility with FAIR data, while understanding and acting to achieve environmental and social goals, i.e., coping uncertainties, and combining green employment and food security. The proposed framework can be adjusted to organizational, financial, and political considerations in different locations worldwide, rethinking the value of information in the context of FAIR data in digital twins.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a framework for a zero-waste, zero-emission food supply chain using FAIR data and a Bayesian approach to select cost-effective solutions, focusing on methane emission mitigation and incorporating social and environmental goals. A case study in Northern Italy illustrates the framework's application and adaptability to various global contexts."

    "published_date": "2023-06-22",
    "abstract": "The increased use of AI systems is associated with multi-faceted societal, environmental, and economic consequences. These include non-transparent decision-making processes, discrimination, increasing inequalities, rising energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in AI model development and application, and an increasing concentration of economic power. By considering the multi-dimensionality of sustainability, this paper takes steps towards substantiating the call for an overarching perspective on\"sustainable AI\". It presents the SCAIS Framework (Sustainability Criteria and Indicators for Artificial Intelligence Systems) which contains a set 19 sustainability criteria for sustainable AI and 67 indicators that is based on the results of a critical review and expert workshops. This interdisciplinary approach contributes a unique holistic perspective to facilitate and structure the discourse on sustainable AI. Further, it provides a concrete framework that lays the foundation for developing standards and tools to support the conscious development and application of AI systems.",

    "published_date": "2023-01-17",
    "abstract": "Climate change is a major global challenge today. To assess how policies may lead to mitigation, economists have developed Integrated Assessment Models, however, most of the equilibrium based models have faced heavy critiques. Agent-based models have recently come to the fore as an alternative macroeconomic modeling framework. In this paper, four Agent-based Integrated Assessment Models linking environment, energy and economy are reviewed. These models have several advantages over existing models in terms of their heterogeneous agents, the allocation of damages amongst the individual agents, representation of the financial system, and policy mixes. While Agent-based Integrated Assessment Models have made strong advances, there are several avenues into which research should be continued, including incorporation of natural resources and spatial dynamics, closer analysis of distributional effects and feedbacks, and multi-sectoral firm network structures.",

    "title": "Subjective-objective policy making approach: Coupling of resident-values multiple regression analysis with value-indices, multi-agent-based simulation",
    "published_date": "2023-06-14",
    "abstract": "Given the concerns around the existing subjective and objective policy evaluation approaches, this study proposes a new combined subjective-objective policy evaluation approach to choose better policy that reflects the will of citizens and is backed up by objective facts. Subjective approaches, such as the Life Satisfaction Approach and the Contingent Valuation Method, convert subjectivity into economic value, raising the question whether a higher economic value really accords with what citizens want. Objective policy evaluation approaches, such as Evidence Based Policy Making and Multi-Agent-Based Simulation, do not take subjectivity into account, making it difficult to choose from diverse and pluralistic candidate policies. The proposed approach establishes a subjective target function based on a multiple regression analysis of the results of a residents questionnaire survey, and uses MABS to calculate the objective evaluation indices for a number of candidate policies. Next, a new subjective-objective coupling target function, combining the explanatory variables of the subjective target function with objective evaluation indices, is set up, optimized to select the preferred policies from numerous candidates. To evaluate this approach, we conducted a verification of renewable energy introduction policies at Takaharu Town in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. The results show a good potential for using a new subjective-objective coupling target function to select policies consistent with the residents values for well-being from 20,000 policy candidates for social, ecological, and economic values obtained in MABS. Using the new approach to compare several policies enables concrete expression of the will of stakeholders with diverse values, and contributes to constructive discussions and consensus-building.",

    "title": "Discrete-choice Multi-agent Optimization: Decentralized Hard Constraint Satisfaction for Smart Cities",
    "published_date": "2023-05-26",
    "abstract": "Making Smart Cities more sustainable, resilient and democratic is emerging as an endeavor of satisfying hard constraints, for instance meeting net-zero targets. Decentralized multi-agent methods for socio-technical optimization of large-scale complex infrastructures such as energy and transport networks are scalable and more privacy-preserving by design. However, they mainly focus on satisfying soft constraints to remain cost-effective. This paper introduces a new model for decentralized hard constraint satisfaction in discrete-choice combinatorial optimization problems. The model solves the cold start problem of partial information for coordination during initialization that can violate hard constraints. It also preserves a low-cost satisfaction of hard constraints in subsequent coordinated choices during which soft constraints optimization is performed. Strikingly, experimental results in real-world Smart City application scenarios demonstrate the required behavioral shift to preserve optimality when hard constraints are satisfied. These findings are significant for policymakers, system operators, designers and architects to create the missing social capital of running cities in more viable trajectories.",

    "title": "Climate change mitigation and SDGs: modelling the regional potential of promising mitigation measures and assessing their impact on other SDGs",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Measures that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also have impacts on achieving other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Given the enormous challenge of achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs, insight into these impacts provides information on how to improve the feasibility of climate change mitigation measures by maximizing the co-benefits and managing the risks of possible trade-offs across SDGs. In this paper, we explore the impact of 20 promising climate mitigation measures on achieving the other SDGs for 11 world regions. Using the IMAGE modelling framework, the paper explores the GHG emission reduction potential of these measures aggregated by the sector under three scenarios. Based on peer-reviewed articles, the impact of the measures on other SDGs is assessed for the top three sectors with the highest GHG reduction potential in each region. We conclude that the number of synergies between the selected climate change mitigation measures and other SDGs dwarf the number of trade-offs in all regions. The magnitude of these synergies and trade-offs, however, varies by regional and socio-economic context. In high- and middle-income regions, the mitigation measures show few trade-offs that are generally associated with technology choices that could aggravate inequality and impact biodiversity. In low-income regions, some measures, especially land-use related ones, could interfere with efforts to reduce poverty, end hunger and improve well-being, if not complemented by additional policies that aim to protect the poor from increasing food and energy prices.",
