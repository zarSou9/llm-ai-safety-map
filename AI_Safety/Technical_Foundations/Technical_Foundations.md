### Mini Description

Research on the technical challenges involved in building AI systems that are reliable, controllable, and aligned with human values. This encompasses fundamental work on understanding, predicting, and improving the behavior of AI systems.

### Description

Technical Foundations in AI safety focuses on the fundamental mathematical, computational, and engineering challenges of building reliable and aligned AI systems. This includes developing formal frameworks for understanding AI behavior, creating verifiable safety properties, and designing architectures that maintain desired characteristics as systems become more capable. Key areas include optimization algorithms that avoid negative side effects, uncertainty quantification in deep learning, and theoretical frameworks for value learning.

Current research emphasizes the importance of interpretability - understanding how AI systems process information and make decisions. This involves both mechanistic interpretability (understanding the internal operations of neural networks) and functional interpretability (characterizing the high-level behavioral patterns of AI systems). Researchers are also developing robust methods for specification, testing, and verification of AI systems, drawing from formal methods in computer science while adapting to the unique challenges of machine learning.

A central challenge is the development of scalable approaches that remain reliable as AI capabilities increase. This includes research on reward modeling, inverse reinforcement learning, and methods for learning human preferences. The field is particularly focused on addressing problems like reward hacking, specification gaming, and distributional shift, while developing theoretical frameworks that can guide the development of increasingly sophisticated AI systems.
