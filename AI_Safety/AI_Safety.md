### Description

AI safety is the interdisciplinary field dedicated to ensuring that artificial intelligence systems are designed, developed, and deployed in ways that align with human values, promote societal well-being, and minimize risks. As AI continues to evolve in capability and influence, the field addresses both immediate concerns, such as fairness, robustness, and transparency in current systems, and long-term challenges, including ensuring that more advanced systems—such as artificial general intelligence (AGI)—operate safely and beneficially.

Central to AI safety is the concept of alignment: ensuring that the goals and actions of AI systems reflect the intentions and ethical principles of their designers. This involves technical challenges, such as designing reward functions and optimization processes that avoid unintended consequences or harmful behaviors. It also requires addressing risks of misuse by bad actors and mitigating systemic impacts on social structures, economies, and power dynamics. Researchers focus on robustness against adversarial attacks, the prevention of unexpected failure modes, and ensuring that AI systems can adapt responsibly to changing or uncertain environments.

The field extends beyond technical concerns to include philosophical, sociopolitical, and regulatory dimensions. For example, it explores the governance mechanisms required to manage global risks posed by unaligned or unsafe AI, emphasizing the need for international collaboration and ethical oversight. By uniting insights from computer science, ethics, economics, and psychology, AI safety aims to build a future where AI serves as a trustworthy and beneficial tool for humanity, avoiding catastrophic outcomes and fostering a collaborative relationship between humans and intelligent systems.
