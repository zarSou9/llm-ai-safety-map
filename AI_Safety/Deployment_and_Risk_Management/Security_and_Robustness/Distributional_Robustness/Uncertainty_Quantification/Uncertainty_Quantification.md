### Mini Description

Techniques for estimating model uncertainty and detecting out-of-distribution inputs, including confidence calibration and distribution shift detection methods.

### Description

Uncertainty Quantification in AI systems focuses on developing methods to reliably estimate and communicate the confidence levels of model predictions, particularly when encountering inputs that differ from training data. This encompasses both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness in the data) and epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty due to limited knowledge or data), with the goal of enabling systems to recognize when they are operating outside their realm of competence.

Current research approaches include Bayesian methods for modeling parameter uncertainty, ensemble techniques that capture model uncertainty through diversity, and direct uncertainty estimation methods that attempt to learn uncertainty bounds from data. Key challenges include calibrating uncertainty estimates to reflect true prediction error rates, developing computationally efficient methods that scale to large models, and handling the complex interactions between different sources of uncertainty.

Emerging areas of investigation focus on the theoretical foundations of uncertainty quantification, including connections to information theory and statistical learning theory. Researchers are particularly interested in developing methods that provide rigorous guarantees on uncertainty estimates, understanding the relationship between uncertainty and model architecture choices, and creating uncertainty aware systems that can appropriately modify their behavior based on confidence levels. Open challenges remain in handling uncertainty in deep learning systems, developing methods robust to adversarial attacks, and creating uncertainty estimates that are interpretable to human operators.
