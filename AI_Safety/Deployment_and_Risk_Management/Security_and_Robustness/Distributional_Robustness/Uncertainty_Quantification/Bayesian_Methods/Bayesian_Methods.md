### Mini Description

Approaches that use Bayesian inference to model uncertainty in model parameters and predictions, including variational inference, Bayesian neural networks, and probabilistic programming techniques.

### Description

Bayesian methods in uncertainty quantification provide a principled framework for reasoning about uncertainty by treating model parameters as probability distributions rather than point estimates. This approach allows for the natural incorporation of prior knowledge and the ability to update beliefs as new evidence is observed, following Bayes' theorem. The resulting posterior distributions capture both parameter uncertainty and predictive uncertainty, enabling more nuanced decision-making in AI systems.

Current research focuses on making Bayesian methods computationally tractable for modern deep learning architectures, as exact Bayesian inference is often intractable for complex models. This has led to the development of various approximation techniques, including variational inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and hybrid approaches that balance computational efficiency with theoretical guarantees. Researchers are particularly interested in methods that scale to high-dimensional parameter spaces while maintaining calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Key challenges include developing more efficient sampling techniques for posterior approximation, designing appropriate prior distributions that encode meaningful inductive biases, and creating architectures that naturally support Bayesian inference while maintaining competitive performance. There is also ongoing work in understanding the relationship between Bayesian approaches and other uncertainty quantification methods, as well as developing theoretical frameworks for analyzing the quality of approximate Bayesian inference.
