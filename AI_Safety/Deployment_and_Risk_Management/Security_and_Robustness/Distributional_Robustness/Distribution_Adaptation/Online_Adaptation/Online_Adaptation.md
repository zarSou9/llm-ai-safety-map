Methods for continuously updating model behavior during deployment to handle distribution shifts in real-time, including techniques for streaming learning and dynamic parameter updates.

### Description

Online Adaptation focuses on methods that enable AI systems to continuously update and modify their behavior during deployment to handle distribution shifts in real-time. This approach recognizes that many real-world applications face constantly evolving data distributions, requiring systems that can adapt without the need for offline retraining or manual intervention. The core challenge lies in developing update mechanisms that are both computationally efficient and statistically sound, ensuring that adaptations improve rather than degrade system performance.

Key research challenges include managing the stability-plasticity trade-off, where systems must balance their ability to adapt quickly against the risk of overfitting to temporary fluctuations or noise. This involves developing robust update rules, determining appropriate learning rates, and implementing safeguards against catastrophic forgetting or performance collapse. Researchers also focus on methods for detecting when adaptation is necessary and ensuring that adaptation mechanisms remain computationally viable for deployment environments.

Current approaches span from lightweight parameter update methods, such as adaptive normalization and moving average statistics, to more sophisticated techniques involving continual learning and meta-learning frameworks. Emerging research directions include developing theoretical guarantees for online adaptation, creating hybrid approaches that combine multiple adaptation mechanisms, and building systems that can leverage past adaptation experiences to inform future updates. There is particular interest in methods that can operate with limited or no explicit supervision, as labeled data is often scarce in deployment settings.
