### Mini Description

Methods for adapting models to handle specific types of distribution shifts, including domain generalization techniques and adaptive normalization approaches.

### Description

Distribution Adaptation encompasses methods and techniques for modifying AI systems to maintain performance when encountering specific types of distribution shifts. Unlike more general approaches to distributional robustness, these methods focus on actively adapting model behavior to handle known or anticipated changes in data distributions, whether through architectural modifications, specialized training procedures, or runtime adaptation mechanisms.

Current research in this area explores various adaptation strategies, from lightweight approaches that adjust batch normalization statistics or feature representations during inference, to more comprehensive methods that involve continuous learning and model updating. Key challenges include balancing adaptation speed against stability, preventing catastrophic forgetting during adaptation, and developing methods that can generalize across different types of distribution shifts while maintaining performance on the original distribution.

Emerging directions in distribution adaptation research focus on meta-learning approaches that enable rapid adaptation to new distributions, self-supervised adaptation techniques that don't require labeled data from the target distribution, and hybrid approaches that combine multiple adaptation mechanisms. There is particular interest in developing adaptation methods that can operate under computational and data constraints while providing theoretical guarantees about adaptation behavior and convergence properties.
