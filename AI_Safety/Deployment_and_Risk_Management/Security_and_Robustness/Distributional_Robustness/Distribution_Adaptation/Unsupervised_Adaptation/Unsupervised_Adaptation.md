### Mini Description

Methods for adapting to new distributions without requiring labeled data from the target domain, including self-supervised and consistency-based approaches.

### Description

Unsupervised Adaptation addresses the challenge of adapting AI systems to new distributions without requiring labeled data from the target domain. This is particularly important in real-world applications where obtaining labeled data for new environments or conditions is often expensive, time-consuming, or impossible. The field explores methods that leverage inherent patterns, structural assumptions, and consistency properties to guide adaptation using only unlabeled data from the target distribution.

Current approaches span several key paradigms: self-training methods that use model confidence to generate pseudo-labels, consistency-based methods that enforce invariance across different views or perturbations of the data, and reconstruction-based methods that leverage generative modeling to understand and adapt to distribution shifts. These techniques often rely on carefully designed regularization strategies and auxiliary tasks to prevent degenerate solutions and ensure meaningful adaptation.

Major research challenges include developing reliable confidence measures for pseudo-label generation, designing effective consistency constraints that capture meaningful invariances, and creating adaptation objectives that avoid mode collapse or catastrophic forgetting. There is particular interest in understanding the theoretical limits of unsupervised adaptation, including what properties of the source and target distributions enable successful adaptation and what guarantees can be provided about adaptation performance.
