### Mini Description

Methods for defining and characterizing the set of distributions or perturbations against which the system should be robust, including statistical distance measures and semantic constraints.

### Description

Uncertainty Set Design focuses on the fundamental challenge of defining and characterizing the space of potential distributions or perturbations against which an AI system should be robust. This involves developing mathematical frameworks to formally specify uncertainty sets that capture meaningful variations while remaining computationally tractable. The key challenge lies in balancing between sets that are too conservative, leading to overly pessimistic solutions, and those that are too narrow, failing to capture important real-world variations.

Current approaches include statistical distance-based methods, which define uncertainty sets using metrics like f-divergences or Wasserstein distances from the training distribution, and semantic constraint-based methods, which incorporate domain knowledge to specify meaningful variations. Researchers also explore data-driven approaches to learn uncertainty sets from observed distribution shifts, and methods for adaptively adjusting uncertainty sets based on empirical performance.

Emerging research questions focus on developing uncertainty sets that better align with human intuitions about meaningful variations, incorporating causal structure to inform set design, and creating hierarchical uncertainty sets that can capture different types of variations at multiple scales. There is particular interest in methods that can automatically identify and prioritize the most relevant dimensions of variation for a given task while remaining computationally feasible for optimization.
