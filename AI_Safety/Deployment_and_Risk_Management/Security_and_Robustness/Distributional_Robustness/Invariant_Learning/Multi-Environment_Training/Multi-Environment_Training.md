### Mini Description

Strategies for learning invariant features by leveraging data from multiple environments or domains, including methods for identifying common patterns across different contexts.

### Description

Multi-Environment Training focuses on developing machine learning methods that leverage data from multiple environments or domains to learn robust, invariant features and relationships. The core premise is that by observing how patterns manifest across different contexts, we can better distinguish fundamental relationships from spurious correlations, leading to more generalizable models.

Current approaches span a spectrum from explicit environment-based regularization to implicit methods that aggregate information across domains. Key challenges include determining how to effectively combine and weight information from different environments, handling environments with varying degrees of similarity or relevance, and developing methods that scale efficiently with the number of training environments. Researchers must also address the trade-off between maintaining performance on seen environments while optimizing for generalization to unseen ones.

Emerging research directions include methods for automatically discovering or constructing relevant training environments, techniques for handling environments with limited or imbalanced data, and approaches for leveraging environment structure in meta-learning frameworks. There is particular interest in developing theoretical frameworks that can characterize when and how multi-environment training leads to improved generalization, as well as methods for determining the minimum number and diversity of environments needed for effective learning.
