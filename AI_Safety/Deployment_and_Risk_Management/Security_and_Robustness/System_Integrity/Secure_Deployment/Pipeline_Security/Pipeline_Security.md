### Mini Description

Methods and tools for securing the deployment pipeline itself, including code signing, artifact verification, and secure build processes.

### Description

Pipeline Security in AI deployment focuses on protecting the entire chain of processes involved in moving AI systems from development to production. This encompasses securing source code repositories, build systems, artifact storage, and deployment orchestration tools against both malicious attacks and accidental compromises. A key challenge is maintaining a verifiable chain of trust across multiple tools, systems, and organizational boundaries while enabling efficient development and deployment workflows.

Current approaches emphasize the principle of 'security by design' through automated security controls, continuous validation, and comprehensive audit trails. This includes implementing secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) practices specifically adapted for AI systems, such as automated vulnerability scanning of both traditional code and model artifacts, signed commits and builds, and tamper-evident logging of all pipeline activities. Researchers are particularly focused on developing methods to verify the provenance and integrity of model weights and training data throughout the pipeline.

Emerging research challenges center on scaling security controls to handle the unique characteristics of AI systems, such as large model artifacts, complex dependencies, and the need for specialized hardware. There is growing emphasis on developing techniques for detecting and preventing supply chain attacks specific to AI systems, including compromised pre-trained models or malicious training data. Key open questions include establishing formal verification methods for pipeline integrity and developing standards for secure AI development practices.
