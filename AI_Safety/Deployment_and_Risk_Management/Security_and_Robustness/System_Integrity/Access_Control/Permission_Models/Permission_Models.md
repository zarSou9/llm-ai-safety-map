### Mini Description

Frameworks for defining and enforcing different levels of access rights and capabilities within AI systems, including role-based access control and attribute-based access control systems.

### Description

Permission Models in AI systems define the frameworks and architectures for specifying and enforcing access rights across different system components and capabilities. These models must balance granular control with practical manageability, allowing organizations to precisely specify who can access what functionality while maintaining a system that remains comprehensible and maintainable. This includes both static permission structures, like role hierarchies, and dynamic models that can adapt based on context, user history, or system state.

A key challenge is developing permission models that can effectively handle the unique characteristics of AI systems, such as managing access to model parameters, controlling inference capabilities, and restricting training data access. This requires new approaches that go beyond traditional file-system-style permissions to encompass concepts like partial model access, graduated capability exposure, and fine-grained control over model behaviors. Researchers must also address the challenge of permission composition - understanding how different permissions interact and combine, especially in complex systems with multiple models and components.

Current research focuses on developing more expressive and verifiable permission models that can capture subtle security requirements while remaining tractable to implement and reason about. This includes work on formal methods for specifying and verifying permission policies, development of capability-based models that naturally align with AI system architectures, and creation of adaptive permission systems that can automatically adjust based on risk assessments and usage patterns. There is particular emphasis on developing models that can effectively handle delegation, composition, and revocation of permissions in distributed AI systems.
