### Mini Description

Mechanisms for managing and restricting the functional capabilities available to different users or processes, including methods for capability isolation and gradual capability expansion.

### Description

Capability Control focuses on the technical and procedural mechanisms for managing what AI systems can and cannot do, particularly in terms of their functional abilities and scope of operation. This involves designing systems with clearly defined and controllable capabilities, implementing mechanisms to restrict or expand these capabilities as needed, and ensuring that systems cannot bypass or modify their own capability limitations.

A key challenge is developing robust isolation between different capability levels while maintaining system performance and allowing for controlled capability expansion when appropriate. This requires careful architectural design to ensure capability boundaries are truly binding and cannot be circumvented through unexpected interactions or emergent behaviors. Researchers must also address the challenge of capability measurement and verification, developing reliable methods to assess what a system can and cannot do.

Current research explores formal methods for defining and enforcing capability boundaries, techniques for gradual capability testing and expansion, and approaches for maintaining capability control in learning systems that may develop new abilities over time. There is particular emphasis on developing capability control mechanisms that remain robust even as AI systems become more sophisticated, including methods for handling potential capability jumps and ensuring that systems cannot self-modify to expand their own capabilities.
