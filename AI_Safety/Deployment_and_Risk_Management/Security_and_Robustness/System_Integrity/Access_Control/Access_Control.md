### Mini Description

Mechanisms and policies for managing and restricting access to AI system components, including authentication, authorization, and audit trails for both human operators and automated processes.

### Description

Access Control in AI systems focuses on managing and restricting interactions with critical system components, including model parameters, training data, inference endpoints, and system configurations. This encompasses both traditional security mechanisms like authentication and authorization, as well as AI-specific considerations such as managing access to model capabilities, controlling inference rates, and monitoring usage patterns for potential misuse or security breaches.

A key challenge is balancing security requirements with system usability and performance. This includes developing fine-grained permission models that can accommodate different user roles and access levels while maintaining system responsiveness. Researchers must also address the unique challenges of AI systems, such as preventing unauthorized model extraction through careful API design, managing access to sensitive training data, and controlling the scope of model capabilities available to different users.

Current research focuses on developing scalable and robust access control frameworks specifically designed for AI systems. This includes work on cryptographic techniques for secure model serving, development of capability-based security models for AI systems, and creation of automated tools for access policy verification. There is particular emphasis on developing methods to detect and prevent subtle forms of unauthorized access, such as model inversion attacks or attempts to probe system boundaries through carefully crafted inputs.
