    "title": "AI Safety Frameworks Should Include Procedures for Model Access Decisions",
    "published_date": "2024-11-15",
    "abstract": "The downstream use cases, benefits, and risks of AI models depend significantly on what sort of access is provided to the model, and who it is provided to. Though existing safety frameworks and AI developer usage policies recognise that the risk posed by a given model depends on the level of access provided to a given audience, the procedures they use to make decisions about model access are ad hoc, opaque, and lacking in empirical substantiation. This paper consequently proposes that frontier AI companies build on existing safety frameworks by outlining transparent procedures for making decisions about model access, which we term Responsible Access Policies (RAPs). We recommend that, at a minimum, RAPs should include the following: i) processes for empirically evaluating model capabilities given different styles of access, ii) processes for assessing the risk profiles of different categories of user, and iii) clear and robust pre-commitments regarding when to grant or revoke specific types of access for particular groups under specified conditions.",
    "summary": "Current AI safety frameworks inadequately address model access control, leading to inconsistent and potentially risky deployment; this paper proposes the creation of transparent \"Responsible Access Policies\" (RAPs) with empirically-grounded procedures for evaluating model capabilities, user risk profiles, and access granting/revocation."

    "title": "Security Threats in Agentic AI System",
    "published_date": "2024-10-16",
    "abstract": "This research paper explores the privacy and security threats posed to an Agentic AI system with direct access to database systems. Such access introduces significant risks, including unauthorized retrieval of sensitive information, potential exploitation of system vulnerabilities, and misuse of personal or confidential data. The complexity of AI systems combined with their ability to process and analyze large volumes of data increases the chances of data leaks or breaches, which could occur unintentionally or through adversarial manipulation. Furthermore, as AI agents evolve with greater autonomy, their capacity to bypass or exploit security measures becomes a growing concern, heightening the need to address these critical vulnerabilities in agentic systems.",
    "summary": "Agentic AI systems with direct database access face significant security threats, including data breaches caused by unauthorized access, system vulnerabilities, and malicious manipulation, exacerbated by the AI's autonomy and data processing capabilities. These threats necessitate robust security measures to protect sensitive information."

    "title": "Meta-Sealing: A Revolutionizing Integrity Assurance Protocol for Transparent, Tamper-Proof, and Trustworthy AI System",
    "published_date": "2024-10-31",
    "abstract": "The Artificial intelligence in critical sectors-healthcare, finance, and public safety-has made system integrity paramount for maintaining societal trust. Current verification methods for AI systems lack comprehensive lifecycle assurance, creating significant vulnerabilities in deployment of both powerful and trustworthy AI. This research introduces Meta-Sealing, a cryptographic framework that fundamentally changes integrity verification in AI systems throughout their operational lifetime. Meta-Sealing surpasses traditional integrity protocols through its implementation of cryptographic seal chains, establishing verifiable, immutable records for all system decisions and transformations. The framework combines advanced cryptography with distributed verification, delivering tamper-evident guarantees that achieve both mathematical rigor and computational efficiency. Our implementation addresses urgent regulatory requirements for AI system transparency and auditability. The framework integrates with current AI governance standards, specifically the EU's AI Act and FDA's healthcare AI guidelines, enabling organizations to maintain operational efficiency while meeting compliance requirements. Testing on financial institution data demonstrated Meta-Sealing's capability to reduce audit timeframes by 62% while enhancing stakeholder confidence by 47%. Results can establish a new benchmark for integrity assurance in enterprise AI deployments. This research presents Meta-Sealing not merely as a technical solution, but as a foundational framework ensuring AI system integrity aligns with human values and regulatory requirements. As AI continues to influence critical decisions, provides the necessary bridge between technological advancement and verifiable trust. Meta-Sealing serves as a guardian of trust, ensuring that the AI systems we depend on are as reliable and transparent as they are powerful.",
    "summary": "Meta-Sealing is a novel cryptographic framework providing comprehensive, tamper-evident integrity assurance for AI systems throughout their lifecycle, leveraging cryptographic seal chains for verifiable and immutable records, thereby enhancing transparency and meeting regulatory compliance. It demonstrably improves audit efficiency and stakeholder confidence."

    "title": "IBAC Mathematics and Mechanics: The Case for 'Integer Based Access Control' of Data Security in the Age of AI and AI Automation",
    "published_date": "2024-10-24",
    "abstract": "Current methods for data access control, especially regarding AI and AI automation, face unique challenges in ensuring appropriate data access. We introduce Integer-Based Access Control (IBAC), addressing the limitations of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). IBAC's mathematical foundations enable its application to relational and NoSQL databases, as well as document authorization. We demonstrate IBAC's suitability for filtering relational database row-level information and AI and NLP access based on separation of duty, supporting both\"need to know\"and\"need to share\"data restrictions. IBAC uses security tokens, which are integers representing aggregated security attributes. These tokens maintain orthogonality across encoded attributes but are stored as integers for fast real-time vector comparison and efficient dominance testing. This mechanism allows high-speed row-level result filtering, ensuring unauthorized records are excluded before results reach the requester. We extend the Bell-LaPadula model by incorporating a\"process constraint,\"overcoming RBAC and ABAC limitations with reduced complexity, increased flexibility, and enhanced performance in data filtering. Our theorems demonstrate the extended Dominance relationship, facilitating rapid federated authorization across diverse databases and file systems. This work reaffirms the practical strength of the Bell-LaPadula model in data security through (1) our mathematical extension, (2) a novel IBAC security attribute encoding scheme, and (3) a simplified dominance testing mechanism for security tokens without decoding.",
    "summary": "Integer-Based Access Control (IBAC) is a novel data access control method using integer-based security tokens to overcome limitations of existing systems like RBAC and ABAC, offering improved performance and flexibility for AI and data security in relational and NoSQL databases. Its mathematical foundation, extending the Bell-LaPadula model, enables efficient real-time filtering and federated authorization."

    "title": "Visibility into AI Agents",
    "published_date": "2024-01-23",
    "abstract": "Increased delegation of commercial, scientific, governmental, and personal activities to AI agents—systems capable of pursuing complex goals with limited supervision—may exacerbate existing societal risks and introduce new risks. Understanding and mitigating these risks involves critically evaluating existing governance structures, revising and adapting these structures where needed, and ensuring accountability of key stakeholders. Information about where, why, how, and by whom certain AI agents are used, which we refer to as visibility, is critical to these objectives. In this paper, we assess three categories of measures to increase visibility into AI agents: agent identifiers, real-time monitoring, and activity logging. For each, we outline potential implementations that vary in intrusiveness and informativeness. We analyze how the measures apply across a spectrum of centralized through decentralized deployment contexts, accounting for various actors in the supply chain including hardware and software service providers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our measures for privacy and concentration of power. Further work into understanding the measures and mitigating their negative impacts can help to build a foundation for the governance of AI agents.",

    "published_date": "2024-06-12",
    "abstract": "AI agents have been boosted by large language models. AI agents can function as intelligent assistants and complete tasks on behalf of their users with access to tools and the ability to execute commands in their environments. Through studying and experiencing the workflow of typical AI agents, we have raised several concerns regarding their security. These potential vulnerabilities are not addressed by the frameworks used to build the agents, nor by research aimed at improving the agents. In this paper, we identify and describe these vulnerabilities in detail from a system security perspective, emphasizing their causes and severe effects. Furthermore, we introduce defense mechanisms corresponding to each vulnerability with design and experiments to evaluate their viability. Altogether, this paper contextualizes the security issues in the current development of AI agents and delineates methods to make AI agents safer and more reliable.",

    "title": "IDs for AI Systems",
    "published_date": "2024-06-17",
    "abstract": "AI systems are increasingly pervasive, yet information needed to decide whether and how to engage with them may not exist or be accessible. A user may not be able to verify whether a system has certain safety certifications. An investigator may not know whom to investigate when a system causes an incident. It may not be clear whom to contact to shut down a malfunctioning system. Across a number of domains, IDs address analogous problems by identifying particular entities (e.g., a particular Boeing 747) and providing information about other entities of the same class (e.g., some or all Boeing 747s). We propose a framework in which IDs are ascribed to instances of AI systems (e.g., a particular chat session with Claude 3), and associated information is accessible to parties seeking to interact with that system. We characterize IDs for AI systems, provide concrete examples where IDs could be useful, argue that there could be significant demand for IDs from key actors, analyze how those actors could incentivize ID adoption, explore a potential implementation of our framework for deployers of AI systems, and highlight limitations and risks. IDs seem most warranted in settings where AI systems could have a large impact upon the world, such as in making financial transactions or contacting real humans. With further study, IDs could help to manage a world where AI systems pervade society.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a framework for assigning unique identifiers (IDs) to AI systems, enabling easier identification, verification of safety certifications, and accountability in case of incidents or malfunctions, particularly for high-impact AI applications. The authors argue that such IDs could significantly improve user trust and safety in an increasingly AI-driven world."
