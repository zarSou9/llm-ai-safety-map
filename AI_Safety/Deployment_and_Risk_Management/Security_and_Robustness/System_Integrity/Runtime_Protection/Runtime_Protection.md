### Mini Description

Techniques for protecting AI systems during execution, including secure enclaves, protected memory spaces, and mechanisms for detecting and preventing runtime tampering or interference.

### Description

Runtime Protection focuses on safeguarding AI systems during their active operation, encompassing techniques and mechanisms that ensure the integrity, security, and proper functioning of AI models as they process inputs and generate outputs. This includes protecting the execution environment, monitoring computational processes, and implementing safeguards against both intentional interference and accidental corruption during model operation.

A key challenge in runtime protection is balancing security measures with performance requirements, as protective mechanisms often introduce computational overhead. Researchers must develop efficient methods for continuous monitoring, isolation of critical components, and real-time detection of anomalies while maintaining the system's ability to meet its operational requirements. This includes considerations around memory protection, secure execution environments, and the preservation of model confidentiality during inference.

Current research focuses on developing hardware-supported security features, lightweight monitoring solutions, and adaptive protection mechanisms that can adjust their security stance based on threat levels and operational contexts. There is particular interest in techniques for securing distributed AI systems, where computation may be split across multiple devices or environments, and in developing methods to ensure the integrity of AI operations in resource-constrained settings.
