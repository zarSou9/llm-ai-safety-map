    "title": "A Theoretical Framework for AI-driven data quality monitoring in high-volume data environments",
    "published_date": "2024-10-11",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical framework for an AI-driven data quality monitoring system designed to address the challenges of maintaining data quality in high-volume environments. We examine the limitations of traditional methods in managing the scale, velocity, and variety of big data and propose a conceptual approach leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Our framework outlines a system architecture that incorporates anomaly detection, classification, and predictive analytics for real-time, scalable data quality management. Key components include an intelligent data ingestion layer, adaptive preprocessing mechanisms, context-aware feature extraction, and AI-based quality assessment modules. A continuous learning paradigm is central to our framework, ensuring adaptability to evolving data patterns and quality requirements. We also address implications for scalability, privacy, and integration within existing data ecosystems. While practical results are not provided, it lays a robust theoretical foundation for future research and implementations, advancing data quality management and encouraging the exploration of AI-driven solutions in dynamic environments."

    "title": "Meta-Sealing: A Revolutionizing Integrity Assurance Protocol for Transparent, Tamper-Proof, and Trustworthy AI System",
    "published_date": "2024-10-31",
    "abstract": "The Artificial intelligence in critical sectors-healthcare, finance, and public safety-has made system integrity paramount for maintaining societal trust. Current verification methods for AI systems lack comprehensive lifecycle assurance, creating significant vulnerabilities in deployment of both powerful and trustworthy AI. This research introduces Meta-Sealing, a cryptographic framework that fundamentally changes integrity verification in AI systems throughout their operational lifetime. Meta-Sealing surpasses traditional integrity protocols through its implementation of cryptographic seal chains, establishing verifiable, immutable records for all system decisions and transformations. The framework combines advanced cryptography with distributed verification, delivering tamper-evident guarantees that achieve both mathematical rigor and computational efficiency. Our implementation addresses urgent regulatory requirements for AI system transparency and auditability. The framework integrates with current AI governance standards, specifically the EU's AI Act and FDA's healthcare AI guidelines, enabling organizations to maintain operational efficiency while meeting compliance requirements. Testing on financial institution data demonstrated Meta-Sealing's capability to reduce audit timeframes by 62% while enhancing stakeholder confidence by 47%. Results can establish a new benchmark for integrity assurance in enterprise AI deployments. This research presents Meta-Sealing not merely as a technical solution, but as a foundational framework ensuring AI system integrity aligns with human values and regulatory requirements. As AI continues to influence critical decisions, provides the necessary bridge between technological advancement and verifiable trust. Meta-Sealing serves as a guardian of trust, ensuring that the AI systems we depend on are as reliable and transparent as they are powerful."

    "title": "Designing Multi-layered Runtime Guardrails for Foundation Model Based Agents: Swiss Cheese Model for AI Safety by Design",
    "published_date": "2024-08-05",
    "abstract": "Foundation Model (FM)-based agents are revolutionizing application development across various domains. However, their rapidly growing capabilities and autonomy have raised significant concerns about AI safety. Researchers are exploring better ways to design guardrails to ensure that the runtime behavior of FM-based agents remains within specific boundaries. Nevertheless, designing effective runtime guardrails is challenging due to the agents' autonomous and non-deterministic behavior. The involvement of multiple pipeline stages and agent artifacts, such as goals, plans, tools, at runtime further complicates these issues. Addressing these challenges at runtime requires multi-layered guardrails that operate effectively at various levels of the agent architecture. Thus, in this paper, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of runtime guardrails for FM-based agents to identify the key quality attributes for guardrails and design dimensions based on the results of a systematic literature review. Inspired by the Swiss Cheese Model, we also propose a reference architecture for designing multi-layered runtime guardrails for FM-based agents, which includes three dimensions: quality attributes, pipelines, and artifacts. The proposed taxonomy and reference architecture provide concrete and robust guidance for researchers and practitioners to build AI-safety-by-design from a software architecture perspective.",

    "title": "Learning Run-time Safety Monitors for Machine Learning Components",
    "published_date": "2024-06-23",
    "abstract": "For machine learning components used as part of autonomous systems (AS) in carrying out critical tasks it is crucial that assurance of the models can be maintained in the face of post-deployment changes (such as changes in the operating environment of the system). A critical part of this is to be able to monitor when the performance of the model at runtime (as a result of changes) poses a safety risk to the system. This is a particularly difficult challenge when ground truth is unavailable at runtime. In this paper we introduce a process for creating safety monitors for ML components through the use of degraded datasets and machine learning. The safety monitor that is created is deployed to the AS in parallel to the ML component to provide a prediction of the safety risk associated with the model output. We demonstrate the viability of our approach through some initial experiments using publicly available speed sign datasets."

    "title": "Closing the Loop on Runtime Monitors with Fallback-Safe MPC",
    "published_date": "2023-09-15",
    "abstract": "When we rely on deep-learned models for robotic perception, we must recognize that these models may behave unreliably on inputs dissimilar from the training data, compromising the closed-loop system's safety. This raises fundamental questions on how we can assess confidence in perception systems and to what extent we can take safety-preserving actions when external environmental changes degrade our perception model's performance. Therefore, we present a framework to certify the safety of a perception-enabled system deployed in novel contexts. To do so, we leverage robust model predictive control (MPC) to control the system using the perception estimates while maintaining the feasibility of a safety-preserving fallback plan that does not rely on the perception system. In addition, we calibrate a runtime monitor using recently proposed conformal prediction techniques to certifiably detect when the perception system degrades beyond the tolerance of the MPC controller, resulting in an end-to-end safety assurance. We show that this control framework and calibration technique allows us to certify the system's safety with orders of magnitudes fewer samples than required to retrain the perception network when we deploy in a novel context on a photo-realistic aircraft taxiing simulator. Furthermore, we illustrate the safety-preserving behavior of the MPC on simulated examples of a quadrotor. We open-source our simulation platform and provide videos of our results at our project page: https://tinyurl.com/fallback-safe-mpc.",
