### Mini Description

Systems and approaches for continuous monitoring of AI execution, including performance tracking, anomaly detection, and verification of computational integrity during operation.

### Description

Runtime Monitoring encompasses the continuous observation and analysis of AI systems during their operational phase to ensure proper functioning, detect anomalies, and verify computational integrity. This includes tracking various operational metrics, analyzing execution patterns, and implementing verification mechanisms that can identify potential issues or security breaches in real-time without significantly impacting system performance.

A key challenge in runtime monitoring is determining what to monitor and how to interpret the collected data. This involves balancing the granularity of monitoring against performance overhead, developing meaningful metrics that can indicate system health or compromise, and creating efficient mechanisms for storing and analyzing monitoring data. Researchers must also address the challenge of monitoring complex AI systems where the relationship between inputs, intermediate states, and outputs may not be easily interpretable.

Current research focuses on developing lightweight monitoring techniques that can operate at scale, including methods for distributed monitoring across multiple compute nodes, approaches for detecting subtle anomalies in model behavior, and techniques for verifying computational correctness without full recomputation. There is particular interest in developing monitoring systems that can adapt to changing conditions and learn from historical patterns while maintaining reliable detection capabilities.
