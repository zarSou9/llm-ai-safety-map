### Mini Description

Systematic approaches for identifying, categorizing, and mitigating potential failure modes in AI systems, including methods for stress testing and analyzing edge cases.

### Description

Failure Mode Analysis in AI systems involves the systematic identification, categorization, and analysis of ways in which AI systems can fail or behave unexpectedly. This encompasses both anticipated failure modes that can be discovered through careful analysis of system design and architecture, as well as emergent failures that may only become apparent through extensive testing or real-world deployment. The field draws on techniques from traditional systems engineering and safety analysis while developing novel approaches specific to the unique challenges of AI systems.

A key focus is developing comprehensive taxonomies of failure modes and methodologies for discovering them. This includes techniques such as stress testing, sensitivity analysis, and systematic exploration of edge cases. Researchers work to understand how different components of AI systems interact and how failures can cascade through these interactions. Special attention is paid to identifying potential failure modes that could lead to catastrophic outcomes or present significant safety risks.

Current research challenges include developing more systematic approaches for discovering potential failure modes in complex AI systems, creating better tools for analyzing the likelihood and severity of different failure modes, and understanding how various safety mechanisms might interact or conflict. There is particular emphasis on methods for identifying subtle failure modes that might not be immediately apparent, such as cases where a system appears to be functioning correctly but is actually operating on incorrect assumptions or pursuing misaligned objectives.
