### Mini Description

Development of strategies and mechanisms for detecting, responding to, and recovering from different types of failures when they occur.

### Description

Recovery Planning in AI safety focuses on developing systematic approaches for responding to and recovering from system failures or safety incidents. This encompasses both immediate response protocols to contain and mitigate active failures, as well as longer-term strategies for system restoration and learning from incidents. The field draws on crisis management and system reliability engineering while addressing the unique challenges posed by AI systems, such as potentially rapid failure cascades and the difficulty of establishing safe reduced-functionality states.

A critical aspect is the development of graceful degradation pathways that allow systems to maintain basic safety guarantees even when operating in compromised states. This includes designing fallback mechanisms, establishing clear criteria for different operational modes, and creating protocols for safe system restoration. Researchers work to balance the need for quick response times with the importance of careful validation during recovery processes.

Current research challenges include developing methods for safely restarting complex AI systems after failures, creating effective isolation mechanisms to prevent failure propagation, and designing robust validation procedures for recovered systems. There is particular emphasis on understanding how to maintain alignment properties during recovery processes and how to effectively incorporate lessons from past incidents into improved recovery strategies. The field also grapples with questions about appropriate human oversight during recovery procedures and how to handle scenarios where standard recovery protocols might be insufficient.
