### Mini Description

Frameworks for managing system capabilities during compromised states, including defining safe operational modes and implementing graceful performance reduction.

### Description

Degradation Management focuses on maintaining safe and predictable AI system behavior when operating under compromised conditions or reduced capabilities. This involves designing systems that can gracefully reduce functionality while preserving core safety properties and maintaining essential services. The challenge lies in determining which capabilities can be safely degraded, how to prioritize different system functions, and how to manage the transition between operational states without introducing new risks.

A key aspect is the development of operational modes that define different levels of system functionality and corresponding safety guarantees. This requires careful consideration of the dependencies between different system components and capabilities, ensuring that degraded states maintain coherent and safe behavior. Researchers work to develop formal specifications for different operational modes, clear transition protocols between states, and mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing operational boundaries.

Current research challenges include developing methods for dynamically adjusting system capabilities based on detected issues, creating robust isolation mechanisms that prevent degradation in one component from affecting others, and designing systems that can maintain alignment properties even with reduced functionality. There is particular emphasis on understanding how to handle scenarios where different degradation strategies might conflict, and how to balance the trade-offs between maintaining system availability and ensuring safety guarantees.
