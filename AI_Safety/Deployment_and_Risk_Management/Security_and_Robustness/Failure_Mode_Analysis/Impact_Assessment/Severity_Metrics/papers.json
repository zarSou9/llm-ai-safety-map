    "title": "FAIL: Analyzing Software Failures from the News Using LLMs",
    "published_date": "2024-06-12",
    "abstract": "Software failures inform engineering work, standards, regulations. For example, the Log4J vulnerability brought government and industry attention to evaluating and securing software supply chains. Retrospective failure analysis is thus a valuable line of software engineering research. Accessing private engineering records is difficult, so such analyses tend to use information reported by the news media. However, prior works in this direction have relied on manual analysis. That has limited the scale of their analyses. The community lacks automated support to enable such analyses to consider a wide range of news sources and incidents.To fill this gap, we propose the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) system. FAIL is a novel LLM-based pipeline that collects, analyzes, and summarizes software failures as reported in the news. FAIL groups articles that describe the same incidents. It then analyzes incidents using existing taxonomies for postmortems, faults, and system characteristics. To tune and evaluate FAIL, we followed the methods of prior works by manually analyzing 31 software failures. FAIL achieved an F1 score of 90% for collecting news about software failures, a V-measure of 0.98 for merging articles reporting on the same incident, and extracted 90% of the facts about failures. We then applied FAIL to a total of 137,427 news articles from 11 providers published between 2010 and 2022. FAIL identified and analyzed 2,457 distinct failures reported across 4,184 articles. Our findings include: (1) current generation of large language models are capable of identifying news articles that describe failures, and analyzing them according to structured taxonomies; (2) high recurrences of similar failures within organizations and across organizations; and (3) severity of the consequences of software failures have increased over the past decade. The full FAIL database is available so that researchers, engineers, and policymakers can learn from a diversity of software failures.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Software defect analysis.",

    "title": "Improved Aircraft Environmental Impact Segmentation via Metric Learning",
    "published_date": "2023-06-24",
    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of aircraft environmental impact is pivotal to the design of operational procedures and policies to mitigate negative aviation environmental impact. Aircraft environmental impact segmentation is a process which clusters aircraft types that have similar environmental impact characteristics based on a set of aircraft features. This practice helps model a large population of aircraft types with insufficient aircraft noise and performance models and contributes to better understanding of aviation environmental impact. Through measuring the similarity between aircraft types, distance metric is the kernel of aircraft segmentation. Traditional ways of aircraft segmentation use plain distance metrics and assign equal weight to all features in an unsupervised clustering process. In this work, we utilize weakly-supervised metric learning and partial information on aircraft fuel burn, emissions, and noise to learn weighted distance metrics for aircraft environmental impact segmentation. We show in a comprehensive case study that the tailored distance metrics can indeed make aircraft segmentation better reflect the actual environmental impact of aircraft. The metric learning approach can help refine a number of similar data-driven analytical studies in aviation."

    "title": "Pricing cyber-insurance for systems via maturity models",
    "published_date": "2023-02-09",
    "abstract": "Pricing insurance for risks associated with information technology systems presents a complex modelling challenge, combining the disciplines of operations management, security, and economics. This work proposes a socioeconomic modelling framework for cyber-insurance decisions compromised of entity relationship diagrams, security maturity models, and economic models, addressing a long-standing research challenge of capturing organizational structure in the design and pricing of cyber-insurance policies. Insurance pricing is usually informed by the long experience insurance companies have of the magnitude and frequency of losses that arise in organizations based on their size, industry sector, and location. Consequently, their calculations of premia will start from a baseline determined by these considerations. A unique challenge of cyber-insurance is that data history is limited and not necessarily informative of future loss risk meaning that established actuarial methodology for other lines of insurance may not be the optimal pricing strategy. The modelling framework proposed in this paper provides a vehicle for agreement between practitioners in the cyber-insurance ecosystem on cyber-security risks and allows for the users to choose their desired level of abstraction in the description of a system.",

    "title": "MARE: Semantic Supply Chain Disruption Management and Resilience Evaluation Framework",
    "published_date": "2022-05-13",
    "abstract": "Supply Chains (SCs) are subject to disruptive events that potentially hinder the operational performance. Disruption Management Process (DMP) relies on the analysis of integrated heterogeneous data sources such as production scheduling, order management and logistics to evaluate the impact of disruptions on the SC. Existing approaches are limited as they address DMP process steps and corresponding data sources in a rather isolated manner which hurdles the systematic handling of a disruption originating anywhere in the SC. Thus, we propose MARE a semantic disruption management and resilience evaluation framework for integration of data sources included in all DMP steps, i.e. Monitor/Model, Assess, Recover and Evaluate. MARE, leverages semantic technologies i.e. ontologies, knowledge graphs and SPARQL queries to model and reproduce SC behavior under disruptive scenarios. Also, MARE includes an evaluation framework to examine the restoration performance of a SC applying various recovery strategies. Semantic SC DMP, put forward by MARE, allows stakeholders to potentially identify the measures to enhance SC integration, increase the resilience of supply networks and ultimately facilitate digitalization.",

    "title": "A novel robustness index for progressive collapse analysis of structures considering the full risk spectrum of damage evolution",
    "abstract": "Abstract The search for a bona fide robustness index to quantify the system performance upon unexpected disturbances has been a continuous research effort. Previous studies have largely neglected to reflect the damage evolution feature of a progressive collapse failure. To bridge this important knowledge gap, this paper presents a novel risk-based robustness index for structures prone to disproportionate progressive collapse. Defined on a new concept, referred to as damage evolution curve, the proposed index considers the full spectrum of risk due to initiating events, and rigorously quantifies the impact of intermediate partial damages on the robustness assessment. Examples using a Daniels system, a truss, and an idealised moment-resistant frame are presented to illustrate how the proposed index is applied for assessing the robustness of structures with increasing complexity. In addition, a comprehensive comparative study against four existing robustness indices is carried out. It is shown that the proposed index provides consistent results for different influencing factors, whereas the other indices either respond counter-intuitively or are insensitive to some of the factors. With consideration of intermediate damage and failure consequences, the development of the proposed robustness index represents an important step towards the performance-based design against progressive collapse.",
