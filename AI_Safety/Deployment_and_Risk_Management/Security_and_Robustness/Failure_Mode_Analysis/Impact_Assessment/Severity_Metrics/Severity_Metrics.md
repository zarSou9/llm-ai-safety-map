### Mini Description

Development of quantitative and qualitative measures to assess the magnitude of harm or disruption caused by different failure modes, including frameworks for comparing impacts across different domains.

### Description

Severity Metrics in AI failure mode analysis focuses on developing systematic frameworks and methodologies for quantifying the magnitude and nature of potential harms from AI system failures. This involves creating standardized ways to measure and compare different types of negative impacts, ranging from direct computational or performance degradation to broader societal harms. A key challenge lies in developing metrics that can meaningfully capture and compare fundamentally different types of impacts, such as economic losses, privacy violations, safety risks, and environmental damage.

The field draws on established approaches from risk assessment and impact evaluation while developing novel metrics specific to AI systems. Current research emphasizes the importance of multi-dimensional measurement frameworks that can capture both the intensity and scope of potential harms. This includes work on developing composite metrics that combine multiple factors, methods for handling uncertainty in impact estimates, and approaches for capturing indirect or harder-to-quantify effects.

A significant open challenge is the development of metrics that can meaningfully compare impacts across different scales and domains while remaining interpretable and practical for decision-making. Researchers are particularly focused on creating metrics that can capture non-linear effects, threshold phenomena, and irreversible impacts. There is also growing emphasis on developing metrics that can account for differential impacts across various populations and potential amplification effects in complex systems.
