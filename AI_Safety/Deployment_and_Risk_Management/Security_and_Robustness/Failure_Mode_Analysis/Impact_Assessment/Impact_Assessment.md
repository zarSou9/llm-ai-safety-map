### Mini Description

Frameworks and methodologies for evaluating the severity, likelihood, and potential consequences of different failure modes, including both immediate and long-term effects.

### Description

Impact Assessment in AI failure mode analysis focuses on developing systematic approaches to evaluate and quantify the potential consequences of different failure modes in AI systems. This involves creating frameworks to assess both the immediate technical impacts and broader societal implications of failures, while considering factors such as failure likelihood, detection difficulty, and cascading effects. The field draws on risk assessment methodologies from other domains while developing novel approaches specific to AI systems.

A key challenge is dealing with uncertainty and incomplete information when evaluating potential impacts. This includes developing methods to reason about unknown unknowns, handling deep uncertainty about complex system behaviors, and accounting for the difficulty in predicting how failures might manifest in real-world contexts. Researchers work to create robust metrics that can meaningfully compare different types of failures while accounting for both quantitative and qualitative factors.

Current research focuses on developing more sophisticated models for impact evaluation that can account for temporal dynamics, indirect effects, and complex interactions between different system components. This includes work on probabilistic risk assessment, causal analysis of failure propagation, and methods for evaluating impacts across different stakeholder groups. There is particular emphasis on developing approaches that can help prioritize mitigation efforts by identifying which failure modes pose the greatest risks.
