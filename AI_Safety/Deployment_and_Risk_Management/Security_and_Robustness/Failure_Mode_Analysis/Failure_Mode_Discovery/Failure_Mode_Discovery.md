### Mini Description

Methods and techniques for identifying potential failure modes, including systematic analysis of system components, automated testing approaches, and empirical observation of system behavior.

### Description

Failure Mode Discovery encompasses the methodologies and approaches used to systematically identify potential ways AI systems can fail, malfunction, or exhibit undesired behaviors. This includes both theoretical analysis techniques that examine system architectures and components, as well as empirical approaches that involve testing and observation. The field draws on traditional software testing methodologies while developing novel approaches specific to the unique challenges of AI systems, such as their often black-box nature and complex emergent behaviors.

A key challenge in failure mode discovery is the development of techniques that can effectively probe the vast space of possible system behaviors and identify meaningful failure modes. This involves balancing between targeted testing of known risk areas and more exploratory approaches that might uncover unexpected failure modes. Researchers employ various methods including formal analysis, automated testing, adversarial probing, and systematic examination of edge cases. Special attention is paid to identifying subtle failure modes that might only manifest under specific conditions or through complex interactions between system components.

Current research focuses on developing more comprehensive and systematic approaches to failure mode discovery, particularly for complex AI systems where traditional testing methods may be insufficient. Open challenges include creating better frameworks for reasoning about potential failure modes during system design, developing more efficient testing strategies that can cover vast input spaces, and building tools that can help identify potential failure modes before they manifest in deployed systems. There is particular emphasis on methods that can discover failure modes related to alignment issues, where systems might be technically functioning as designed but pursuing unintended objectives.
