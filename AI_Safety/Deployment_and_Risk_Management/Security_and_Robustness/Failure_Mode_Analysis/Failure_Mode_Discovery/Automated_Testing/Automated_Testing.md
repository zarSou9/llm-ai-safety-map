### Mini Description

Development and application of automated tools and techniques for systematically exploring system behavior, including fuzzing, property-based testing, and automated scenario generation.

### Description

Automated Testing in AI safety focuses on developing and implementing systematic approaches to automatically explore the behavior space of AI systems to discover potential failure modes, bugs, and unexpected behaviors. This encompasses both traditional software testing techniques adapted for AI systems and novel methods specifically designed to handle the unique challenges of testing neural networks and other machine learning models. Key approaches include systematic input space exploration, property-based testing, metamorphic testing, and automated scenario generation.

A central challenge is the vast input space that needs to be explored and the difficulty in defining precise test oracles for AI systems. Unlike traditional software where correct behavior can often be precisely specified, AI systems often operate in domains where 'correct' behavior is context-dependent or difficult to formally define. This has led to the development of specialized testing approaches that focus on identifying behavioral consistency, detecting anomalous outputs, and verifying that system behaviors remain within acceptable bounds.

Current research focuses on developing more efficient and effective testing strategies that can scale to complex AI systems while providing meaningful coverage guarantees. This includes work on test case generation strategies that can identify edge cases and corner cases more effectively, techniques for automatically generating test scenarios that stress-test specific system capabilities, and methods for evaluating the completeness and effectiveness of testing approaches. There is particular emphasis on developing testing frameworks that can identify subtle failure modes related to AI alignment and safety concerns.
