### Mini Description

Defensive techniques applied to inputs before they reach the model, such as randomization, denoising, and transformation methods that aim to neutralize adversarial perturbations.

### Description

Input preprocessing in adversarial defense focuses on transforming or sanitizing inputs before they reach the main AI model, aiming to neutralize potential adversarial perturbations while preserving the semantic content necessary for the model's task. These methods operate independently of the model architecture, making them versatile and applicable across different systems. However, this independence also means they must maintain a delicate balance between removing adversarial artifacts and preserving legitimate input features.

The field encompasses both deterministic and stochastic approaches. Deterministic methods include various forms of filtering, compression, and reconstruction techniques that attempt to project inputs onto manifolds of natural data. Stochastic approaches introduce randomness into the preprocessing pipeline to make attacks harder to optimize against. Both categories face the challenge of adaptive attacks, where adversaries can attempt to bypass the preprocessing by incorporating it into their attack optimization.

Current research challenges include developing preprocessing methods that scale to high-dimensional inputs, maintaining effectiveness against adaptive attackers, and reducing computational overhead for real-time applications. There is particular interest in techniques that can provide theoretical guarantees about their defensive properties while minimizing the impact on model performance for clean inputs. The field also explores the combination of multiple preprocessing techniques and their interaction with other defensive measures.
