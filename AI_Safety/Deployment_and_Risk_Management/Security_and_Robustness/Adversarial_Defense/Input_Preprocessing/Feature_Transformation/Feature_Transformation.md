### Mini Description

Methods that modify input features through operations like quantization, principal component analysis, or wavelet transforms to remove adversarial perturbations while preserving task-relevant information.

### Description

Feature transformation encompasses methods that modify input data through mathematical operations to remove or neutralize adversarial perturbations while preserving the essential characteristics needed for model inference. These transformations can range from simple linear operations like dimensionality reduction to more complex non-linear transformations that exploit the statistical properties of natural data. The key challenge lies in identifying transformations that effectively distinguish between legitimate features and adversarial modifications while maintaining computational efficiency.

Current research focuses on developing transformations that are differentiable (allowing end-to-end training), reversible (enabling reconstruction of original inputs when needed), and robust to adaptive attacks. There is particular interest in transformations that can provide theoretical guarantees about their defensive properties, such as Lipschitz-bounded operations or transformations that provably preserve certain geometric properties of the input space.

Open challenges include developing transformations that scale effectively to high-dimensional inputs, maintaining robustness against attackers who have knowledge of the transformation, and reducing the computational overhead of complex transformations. Researchers are also exploring ways to automatically learn optimal transformations from data, rather than relying on hand-crafted operations, while ensuring these learned transformations maintain reliable defensive properties.
