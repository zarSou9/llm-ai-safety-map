### Mini Description

Frameworks for characterizing attacker capabilities, constraints, and objectives to ensure comprehensive evaluation across relevant attack scenarios.

### Description

Threat modeling in the context of AI defense evaluation involves systematically analyzing and characterizing potential adversaries, their capabilities, resources, and objectives when attacking AI systems. This includes defining the scope of attacks (from small perturbations to system-level compromises), specifying attacker knowledge (black-box to white-box), and considering various motivations (from testing robustness to causing targeted failures).

A comprehensive threat model must balance theoretical completeness with practical relevance. While it's important to consider a wide range of potential attack vectors, focusing too broadly can lead to overly conservative or impractical defensive measures. Modern approaches emphasize adaptive threat models that can evolve as new attack capabilities are discovered and as AI systems become more complex and widely deployed.

Key research challenges include developing frameworks for quantifying attacker capabilities, establishing standardized threat model taxonomies, and creating methods for evaluating defenses against previously unknown attack types. There is particular interest in understanding how different threat models interact with various defensive strategies and how to prioritize defense development based on risk assessment of different threat scenarios.
