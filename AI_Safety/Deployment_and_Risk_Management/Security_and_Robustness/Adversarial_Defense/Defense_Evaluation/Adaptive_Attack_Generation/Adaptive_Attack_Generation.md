### Mini Description

Methods for automatically generating and optimizing attacks specifically designed to break or circumvent particular defensive mechanisms.

### Description

Adaptive Attack Generation focuses on developing automated methods to create and optimize attacks that specifically target and potentially bypass defensive mechanisms in AI systems. Unlike static attacks that follow predefined patterns, adaptive attacks dynamically adjust their strategies based on the specific properties and potential weaknesses of the defense being evaluated, making them crucial for thorough security assessment.

The field encompasses various technical approaches, from gradient-based optimization methods that exploit the internal structure of neural networks to evolutionary algorithms that can discover novel attack patterns. A key challenge is developing methods that can effectively probe defenses even when they employ gradient masking or other techniques that obscure their vulnerabilities. This often requires combining multiple attack strategies and developing sophisticated optimization techniques that can work with limited or noisy feedback.

Current research challenges include automating the discovery of defense vulnerabilities without requiring extensive domain expertise, developing more efficient search strategies for finding minimal adversarial perturbations, and creating attacks that can generalize across different model architectures and defense mechanisms. There is particular interest in developing principled approaches to adaptive attack generation that can provide theoretical guarantees about the comprehensiveness of the evaluation.
