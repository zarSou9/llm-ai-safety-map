### Mini Description

Development and standardization of quantitative measures for assessing defense effectiveness, including robustness metrics, efficiency considerations, and trade-off analyses.

### Description

Performance Metrics in defense evaluation focuses on developing quantitative measures to assess how well defensive techniques protect AI systems against adversarial attacks. These metrics must capture multiple aspects of defense performance, including robustness against various attack types, computational overhead, impact on clean accuracy, and scalability to real-world deployment scenarios. The challenge lies in creating metrics that are both comprehensive enough to capture meaningful security guarantees while remaining practical to compute and compare across different defensive approaches.

Traditional accuracy-based metrics, while important, have proven insufficient for fully characterizing defense performance. Modern approaches incorporate multiple dimensions of evaluation, such as the size of the provably protected input space, the computational cost of the defense, and the degradation of model performance on non-adversarial inputs. Researchers have developed sophisticated frameworks for measuring robustness under different threat models, including metrics based on geometric properties of the input space, statistical guarantees, and worst-case performance bounds.

Current research challenges include developing metrics that can effectively compare different types of defenses (e.g., detection-based vs. robust training approaches), creating standardized ways to measure defense overhead and deployment costs, and establishing methods to evaluate defense performance against unknown or adaptive attacks. There is particular interest in metrics that can provide meaningful comparisons across different model architectures, dataset domains, and application contexts while accounting for real-world constraints and requirements.
