### Mini Description

Methods that detect adversarial examples by analyzing statistical properties of inputs or model activations, including density estimation, manifold analysis, and distribution testing.

### Description

Statistical Analysis in adversarial detection leverages mathematical and probabilistic tools to identify potential adversarial examples by examining the statistical properties of inputs, model activations, and output distributions. This approach is founded on the observation that adversarial examples often exhibit detectable statistical anomalies compared to natural inputs, whether in their raw form or in their effects on model behavior. These methods range from simple distribution testing to sophisticated density estimation techniques that model the manifold of legitimate data.

A fundamental challenge in statistical detection is establishing reliable baseline distributions that characterize normal inputs while accounting for the natural variability present in real-world data. This becomes particularly complex in high-dimensional spaces where traditional statistical tools may break down or become computationally intractable. Additionally, adaptive adversaries can potentially modify their attacks to match the statistical properties of legitimate inputs, necessitating increasingly sophisticated detection mechanisms.

Current research focuses on developing more robust statistical measures that remain effective under adaptive attacks, exploring ways to leverage multiple statistical signals simultaneously, and creating methods that scale efficiently to high-dimensional data. There is particular interest in techniques that can provide theoretical guarantees about detection rates while maintaining practical computational requirements. Researchers are also investigating the relationship between statistical properties and other aspects of model behavior, such as uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution detection.
