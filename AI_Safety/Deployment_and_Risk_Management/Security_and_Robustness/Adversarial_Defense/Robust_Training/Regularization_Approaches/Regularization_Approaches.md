### Mini Description

Methods that modify the loss function or add constraints to promote robust features and discourage brittle ones, without explicitly generating adversarial examples.

### Description

Regularization approaches in robust training focus on modifying the learning objective or adding constraints to naturally promote robustness, without explicitly generating adversarial examples. These methods typically work by encouraging the model to learn smoother decision boundaries, reduce sensitivity to input perturbations, or maintain consistent predictions across similar inputs. The key advantage of these approaches is their computational efficiency compared to adversarial training, though they often provide weaker robustness guarantees.

Common techniques include adding penalty terms to the loss function that measure input sensitivity, enforcing Lipschitz constraints on network layers, and promoting feature consistency across transformations. Some approaches draw inspiration from theoretical insights about the relationship between robustness and generalization, leading to regularizers that encourage models to learn robust features rather than brittle correlations. Recent work has also explored combining multiple regularization techniques or adaptively adjusting regularization strength based on training dynamics.

Current research challenges include developing regularizers that can provide stronger robustness guarantees, understanding the theoretical foundations of different regularization approaches, and creating methods that scale effectively to larger models and datasets. There is particular interest in regularization techniques that can simultaneously improve robustness against multiple types of perturbations or that can be effectively combined with other defensive strategies.
