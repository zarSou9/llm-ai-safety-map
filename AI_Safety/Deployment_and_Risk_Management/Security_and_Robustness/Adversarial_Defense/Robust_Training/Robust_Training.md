### Mini Description

Methods for training models to be inherently resistant to adversarial examples, including adversarial training, regularization techniques, and architectural modifications.

### Description

Robust training encompasses methods and techniques for training neural networks to maintain reliable performance in the presence of adversarial perturbations. The core approach involves modifying the training process to explicitly account for potential adversarial manipulations, typically by incorporating adversarial examples into the training data or by modifying the optimization objective to promote robustness. This creates models that are inherently more resistant to attacks rather than relying on post-hoc defenses.

A fundamental challenge in robust training is the computational cost, as generating adversarial examples during training can increase computational requirements by an order of magnitude or more. This has led to research into efficient approximations and alternative formulations that can achieve similar robustness guarantees with reduced computational overhead. Additionally, robust training often faces a trade-off between adversarial robustness and standard accuracy, where improving one metric can lead to degradation in the other.

Current research focuses on developing more efficient and effective robust training methods, understanding the theoretical foundations of the robustness-accuracy trade-off, and creating techniques that can provide robustness against multiple types of perturbations simultaneously. There is particular interest in approaches that can scale to large models and datasets, as well as methods that can maintain robustness across different deployment contexts and threat models.
