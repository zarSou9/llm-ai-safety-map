### Mini Description

Statistical approaches to certification, such as randomized smoothing and its variants, that provide probabilistic guarantees about model behavior under perturbations.

### Description

Probabilistic certification represents a statistical approach to providing robustness guarantees for AI systems, offering scalable alternatives to deterministic verification methods. At its core, these techniques use randomization and statistical sampling to establish probabilistic bounds on model behavior under perturbations, trading absolute certainty for computational tractability and applicability to larger networks.

The field is dominated by randomized smoothing techniques, which create smoothed classifiers by adding Gaussian noise to inputs and using statistical tests to certify robustness properties. Recent advances have extended these methods beyond simple L2 norms to handle more complex perturbation types, including geometric transformations, semantic changes, and natural corruption models. Researchers are also developing techniques to optimize the certification process, balancing the trade-off between certification radius, confidence levels, and computational cost.

Current challenges include improving certification bounds without sacrificing efficiency, developing methods for complex architectures like transformers and graph neural networks, and extending certification to new properties beyond classification robustness. There is particular interest in techniques that can handle multiple threat models simultaneously or provide guarantees about more sophisticated behavioral properties, such as semantic consistency or causal relationships.
