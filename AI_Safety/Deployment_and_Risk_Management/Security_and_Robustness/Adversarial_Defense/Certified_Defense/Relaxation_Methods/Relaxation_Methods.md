### Mini Description

Approaches that provide certified bounds by relaxing the verification problem, including interval bound propagation, linear programming relaxations, and semidefinite programming techniques.

### Description

Relaxation methods in certified defense involve approximating complex neural network verification problems with more tractable optimization problems that can provide provable bounds on model behavior. These approaches trade some precision for computational efficiency by 'relaxing' the exact verification problem into a simpler form that can be solved more easily, while still maintaining valid (though potentially conservative) guarantees about model properties.

The key insight behind these methods is that while exact verification is NP-hard, carefully chosen relaxations can yield useful bounds while remaining computationally feasible. Common approaches include converting neural network operations into linear programming constraints, using convex relaxations of activation functions, and employing dual optimization techniques. These methods typically provide outer approximations of the true reachable set of network outputs, ensuring that the derived certificates are sound even if not tight.

Current research focuses on developing tighter relaxations that reduce the gap between certified and empirical robustness, while maintaining computational efficiency. This includes work on adaptive relaxation schemes that adjust based on network architecture and input characteristics, hybrid approaches that combine multiple relaxation techniques, and methods for automatically learning optimal relaxation parameters. A major challenge is scaling these approaches to larger networks while maintaining meaningful guarantees.
