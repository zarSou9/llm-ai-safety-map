### Mini Description

Methods and architectures for protecting AI systems against intentional attacks, including techniques for detecting and mitigating adversarial examples, poisoning attacks, and other malicious manipulations.

### Description

Adversarial defense focuses on protecting AI systems against intentionally crafted inputs designed to manipulate or deceive model behavior. These adversarial attacks can range from subtle perturbations that cause misclassification to more sophisticated techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities. The field encompasses both empirical defense methods, which aim to make models more robust through training techniques, and certified defenses that provide provable guarantees against certain classes of attacks.

A key challenge in adversarial defense is the fundamental tension between model accuracy on clean inputs and robustness against adversarial examples. Many defense mechanisms that improve robustness can lead to decreased performance on normal inputs, necessitating careful consideration of trade-offs. Additionally, the arms race between attack and defense methods has shown that many empirical defenses that appear effective can be broken by more sophisticated attacks, highlighting the importance of rigorous evaluation and theoretical guarantees.

Current research directions include developing scalable certification methods, understanding the theoretical foundations of adversarial robustness, and creating architectures inherently resistant to attacks. There is growing interest in approaches that combine multiple defense strategies, such as detection and robust training, as well as methods that can maintain effectiveness across different types of attacks and threat models. The field also increasingly considers the interaction between adversarial robustness and other desirable properties like interpretability and fairness.
