### Mini Description

Exact verification techniques that provide guaranteed bounds on network behavior, including SMT-based approaches and mixed-integer linear programming methods.

### Description

Complete Methods in neural network verification represent approaches that provide exact, mathematically rigorous guarantees about network behavior without false positives or negatives. These methods typically work by formulating verification problems as constraint satisfaction or optimization problems, often leveraging techniques from formal methods and mathematical programming. The primary approaches include SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving, which encodes network behavior as logical formulas, and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), which represents neural networks as systems of linear constraints with integer variables.

While these methods offer the strongest possible guarantees, they face significant scalability challenges due to their NP-hard computational complexity. Current research focuses on developing more efficient encoding schemes, leveraging problem structure for faster solving, and creating specialized solvers optimized for neural network verification tasks. Particular attention is paid to techniques for handling ReLU activations, which introduce non-linear behavior and significantly complicate the verification process.

Emerging directions include hybrid approaches that combine complete methods with incomplete techniques for initial bounds, methods for incrementally refining verification results, and techniques for parallelizing verification across multiple processors. Researchers are also exploring ways to exploit network architecture and training procedures to make complete verification more tractable, as well as developing specialized complete methods for specific types of properties or network architectures.
