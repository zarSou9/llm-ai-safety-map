### Mini Description

Techniques that approximate neural network behavior using various forms of relaxation, such as interval arithmetic, linear relaxations, and semidefinite programming approaches.

### Description

Relaxation-based methods in neural network verification aim to make the verification problem tractable by approximating the complex, non-linear behavior of neural networks with simpler mathematical forms that are easier to analyze. These approaches construct over-approximations of the network's possible outputs, trading some precision for computational efficiency. The key challenge lies in finding relaxations that are both tight enough to be useful and loose enough to be computationally feasible.

The field has evolved from simple interval arithmetic to more sophisticated convex relaxations, including linear programming (LP) relaxations, semidefinite programming (SDP) approaches, and hybrid methods that combine multiple relaxation techniques. Each approach offers different trade-offs between precision, scalability, and computational cost. Recent advances have focused on developing adaptive relaxation schemes that can automatically adjust their precision based on the verification task at hand.

Current research challenges include developing tighter relaxations for specific network architectures, creating efficient methods for handling activation functions, and scaling relaxation techniques to larger networks. There is particular interest in methods that can provide probabilistic guarantees or bounds on the approximation error, as well as techniques that can efficiently handle different types of specifications and constraints.
