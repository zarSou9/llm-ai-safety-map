### Mini Description

Methods that create abstract representations of neural networks to enable efficient verification, including abstract interpretation and symbolic analysis approaches.

### Description

Abstraction Techniques in neural network verification focus on creating simplified yet sound representations of neural networks that preserve relevant properties while making verification more tractable. These methods transform complex neural network behaviors into abstract domains that are easier to analyze mathematically, trading some precision for computational feasibility. The key challenge lies in finding abstractions that are coarse enough to be computationally efficient while being precise enough to verify properties of interest.

Current approaches span multiple levels of abstraction, from neuron-level techniques that abstract individual activation functions to layer-wise methods that capture relationships between groups of neurons. Research has progressed from simple interval abstractions to more sophisticated techniques using zonotopes, polyhedra, and hybrid domains. These methods often leverage theory from abstract interpretation, allowing formal reasoning about the relationship between abstract and concrete network behaviors.

Emerging research directions include developing adaptive abstraction techniques that automatically adjust precision based on verification requirements, methods for abstracting attention mechanisms and other complex architectural components, and techniques for maintaining sound abstractions through network composition. There is particular interest in creating abstractions that can efficiently handle both the discrete and continuous aspects of neural network behavior, as well as methods for systematically refining abstractions when verification fails.
