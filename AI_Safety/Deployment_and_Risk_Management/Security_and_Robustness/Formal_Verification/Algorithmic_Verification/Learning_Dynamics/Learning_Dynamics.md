### Mini Description

Methods for analyzing and proving properties about how AI systems evolve during training, including interaction dynamics in multi-agent systems and curriculum learning.

### Description

Learning dynamics focuses on understanding and proving properties about how AI systems evolve during the training process, encompassing both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. This includes analyzing trajectory behaviors, stability properties, and emergent phenomena that arise as systems learn and adapt. The field combines techniques from dynamical systems theory, game theory, and statistical physics to develop mathematical frameworks for characterizing learning behavior.

A central challenge is understanding the complex interactions between learning algorithms, architectures, and training environments. Researchers study how different components influence learning trajectories, including the impact of initialization, data distribution, and optimization parameters. This involves developing tools to analyze both local and global properties of learning dynamics, such as attraction basins, phase transitions, and equilibrium behaviors.

Current research directions include understanding scaling laws in large models, characterizing the role of symmetries in learning, and analyzing emergence of capabilities during training. There is particular interest in developing predictive theories that can anticipate learning outcomes, identify potential failure modes, and guide the design of more efficient and reliable training procedures. This includes studying phenomena like loss landscape geometry, representation evolution, and the dynamics of knowledge transfer.
