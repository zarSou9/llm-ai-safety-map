### Mini Description

Techniques for verifying properties of systems with probabilistic transitions or outcomes, including methods for analyzing Markov decision processes and other stochastic models.

### Description

Stochastic model checking focuses on verifying properties of AI systems that exhibit probabilistic behavior, combining techniques from formal verification with probabilistic reasoning. This includes analyzing Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Probabilistic Automata, and other stochastic models to prove properties about expected behaviors, worst-case scenarios, and probabilistic safety guarantees. The field addresses challenges in both discrete and continuous state spaces, temporal properties, and the verification of complex behavioral specifications.

A key challenge lies in managing the state space explosion inherent in probabilistic systems while maintaining precise guarantees. Researchers develop techniques for abstraction, symmetry reduction, and compositional reasoning to make verification tractable for real-world systems. This includes methods for handling both discrete probability distributions and continuous random variables, as well as techniques for verifying properties under partial observability or with missing information.

Current research focuses on developing more efficient algorithms for probabilistic verification, including approximate methods that can provide bounded-error guarantees. There is particular interest in techniques for verifying properties of learning systems that interact with stochastic environments, as well as methods for handling non-stationary processes and adaptive behaviors. Emerging approaches combine traditional model checking with machine learning techniques to scale to larger systems while maintaining rigorous probabilistic guarantees.
