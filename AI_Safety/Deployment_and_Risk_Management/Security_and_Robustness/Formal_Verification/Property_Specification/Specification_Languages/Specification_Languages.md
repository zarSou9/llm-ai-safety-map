### Mini Description

Formal languages and notations for expressing properties and constraints, including temporal logics, modal logics, and domain-specific languages designed for AI systems.

### Description

Specification languages for AI formal verification are formal mathematical notations and frameworks designed to precisely express properties, behaviors, and constraints of AI systems in a way that enables automated reasoning and verification. These languages must balance expressiveness, allowing complex properties to be stated naturally, with tractability, ensuring the resulting specifications can be efficiently verified. They range from general-purpose formal logics to domain-specific languages tailored for particular types of AI systems or properties.

A key challenge in designing specification languages is handling the unique characteristics of AI systems, such as probabilistic behaviors, learning-based adaptation, and complex temporal dynamics. This has led to the development of specialized extensions to traditional formal methods languages, incorporating features like probabilistic operators, learning-aware constructs, and mechanisms for expressing uncertainty. Modern specification languages often need to integrate multiple formal frameworks to capture different aspects of AI behavior, such as combining temporal logic for sequential properties with probabilistic logic for uncertainty.

Current research focuses on developing more expressive and practical specification languages that can handle emerging AI architectures and safety requirements. This includes work on neural-symbolic languages that bridge connectionist and symbolic approaches, specification languages for multi-agent systems, and frameworks for expressing high-level ethical constraints. There is particular interest in creating languages that support modular specification development and automated reasoning while remaining accessible to practitioners who may not be formal methods experts.
