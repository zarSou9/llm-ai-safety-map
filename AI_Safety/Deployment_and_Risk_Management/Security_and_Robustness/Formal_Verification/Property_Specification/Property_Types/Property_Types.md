### Mini Description

Classification and formalization of different kinds of properties that need to be specified, such as safety properties, liveness properties, fairness constraints, and performance requirements.

### Description

Property Types in formal verification encompasses the different categories of specifications that need to be formally defined and verified in AI systems. These properties range from basic functional requirements to complex behavioral constraints, each requiring different mathematical frameworks and verification approaches. Understanding and categorizing these property types is essential for selecting appropriate verification techniques and ensuring comprehensive system validation.

The classification of properties often follows established patterns from traditional software verification, adapted for the unique challenges of AI systems. Safety properties assert that nothing bad happens (invariants that must always hold), while liveness properties specify that something good eventually happens. Beyond these fundamental types, AI systems require specialized properties dealing with probabilistic behaviors, learning dynamics, and value alignment. Each property type may require different formal frameworks - from temporal logic for sequential behaviors to probabilistic logic for uncertainty-based properties.

A key challenge in property type classification is handling the emergence of novel property types specific to AI systems, such as robustness against distribution shift or maintenance of ethical constraints. These often require extending traditional verification frameworks or developing entirely new formalisms. Researchers must also address the interaction between different property types, as real-world AI systems typically need to satisfy multiple properties simultaneously, potentially leading to conflicts or trade-offs that must be formally reasoned about.
