### Mini Description

Measures to protect AI systems against attacks, manipulations, and failures, including cybersecurity considerations and ensuring reliable performance under varying conditions.

### Description

Security and Robustness in AI systems encompasses the technical approaches and methodologies needed to ensure AI systems maintain reliable, predictable, and safe operation across a wide range of conditions and potential threats. This includes defending against both intentional attacks (such as adversarial examples, data poisoning, and model extraction) and unintentional failure modes (such as distribution shift, cascading errors, and hardware failures). The field draws from classical cybersecurity principles while developing novel approaches specific to the unique challenges posed by AI systems.

A key focus is on developing AI systems that demonstrate consistent and reliable behavior even when faced with unexpected inputs or environmental changes. This involves techniques for formal verification of system properties, methods for quantifying uncertainty and confidence in model outputs, and approaches for graceful degradation when operating outside normal parameters. Researchers work to understand failure modes, develop robustness metrics, and create systems that maintain safety guarantees under adversarial conditions.

Current research challenges include developing scalable verification techniques for deep learning systems, creating robust architectures that can detect and resist various forms of attack, and building systems that can maintain performance guarantees under distribution shift. There is particular emphasis on understanding the fundamental trade-offs between model performance and robustness, as well as developing techniques that can provide formal safety guarantees without sacrificing the benefits of modern AI approaches.
