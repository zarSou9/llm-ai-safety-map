### Mini Description

Mathematical frameworks and proofs establishing rigorous bounds on system behavior, including worst-case performance guarantees and formal safety properties.

### Description

Theoretical guarantees in AI safety focus on developing rigorous mathematical frameworks and proofs that establish provable bounds on system behavior. These guarantees aim to provide formal assurances about safety-critical properties, such as constraint satisfaction, convergence properties, and worst-case performance bounds. Unlike empirical testing, theoretical guarantees offer absolute certainty within their specified assumptions and conditions.

A central challenge lies in bridging the gap between abstract mathematical frameworks and practical AI systems. This includes developing theories that can handle the complexity and stochastic nature of modern AI while remaining tractable and meaningful. Researchers must balance the strength of guarantees against the restrictiveness of assumptions, often working to extend existing theoretical frameworks to handle more realistic scenarios.

Current research emphasizes developing guarantees that remain valid under system learning and environmental uncertainty. Key areas include invariant verification, robustness certificates, and convergence proofs for learning algorithms. There is particular interest in compositional guarantees that can scale to complex systems, as well as methods for maintaining theoretical guarantees during system updates or environmental changes.
