### Mini Description

Approaches based on Bayesian inference for representing and computing model uncertainty, including Bayesian neural networks and probabilistic programming frameworks.

### Description

Bayesian methods in AI safety uncertainty quantification focus on representing and computing model uncertainty through principled probabilistic approaches grounded in Bayesian inference. These methods treat model parameters and predictions as probability distributions rather than point estimates, allowing for natural uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions. This provides a theoretically rigorous framework for reasoning about both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in AI systems.

A central challenge lies in scaling Bayesian inference to modern deep learning architectures while maintaining computational tractability. Traditional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, while theoretically well-founded, often become impractical for large-scale models. This has led to the development of various approximation techniques, including variational inference methods and hybrid approaches that combine Bayesian principles with deep learning architectures.

Current research focuses on developing more efficient and accurate methods for approximate Bayesian inference in deep networks, improving the quality of uncertainty estimates, and establishing theoretical guarantees for Bayesian approaches. Key open questions include how to design appropriate prior distributions, how to handle model misspecification, and how to validate the quality of Bayesian uncertainty estimates in high-stakes applications. There is particular interest in methods that can maintain calibrated uncertainty estimates under distribution shift while remaining computationally viable for deployment.
