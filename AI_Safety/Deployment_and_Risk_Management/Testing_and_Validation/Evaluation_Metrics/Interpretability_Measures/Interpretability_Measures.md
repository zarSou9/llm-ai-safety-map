### Mini Description

Metrics for assessing the transparency and explainability of system decisions, including measures of decision attribution and behavioral predictability.

### Description

Interpretability measures in AI safety focus on quantifying and evaluating how well we can understand, analyze, and predict the decision-making processes of AI systems. These metrics assess both the transparency of individual decisions and the broader intelligibility of system behavior patterns, aiming to ensure that safety-critical aspects of AI systems remain comprehensible and verifiable by human overseers.

A key challenge in developing interpretability measures is balancing the trade-off between fidelity and simplicity. High-fidelity explanations capture more nuanced aspects of system behavior but may become too complex for practical use, while simpler metrics risk oversimplifying important details. Researchers work to develop metrics that can meaningfully capture both local interpretability (understanding specific decisions) and global interpretability (understanding overall system behavior), while accounting for different stakeholder needs and varying levels of technical expertise.

Current research emphasizes the development of quantitative measures for assessing the quality and reliability of explanations, including metrics for completeness, consistency, and human-interpretable complexity. There is particular focus on developing measures that can scale to more complex models and architectures, while maintaining their validity across different domains and tasks. Open challenges include creating metrics that can effectively evaluate counterfactual explanations, assess the faithfulness of interpretability methods to the original model, and quantify the practical utility of explanations for different use cases.
