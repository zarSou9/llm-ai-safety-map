### Mini Description

Measures of how well system decisions align with human judgments and preferences, including metrics for value learning and preference inference.

### Description

Human Agreement metrics focus on quantifying how well AI system decisions and behaviors align with human judgments, preferences, and values. This involves developing systematic ways to measure the correspondence between AI outputs and human assessments across various tasks and contexts, while accounting for the complexity and diversity of human preferences. Key challenges include handling preference inconsistencies across different individuals or groups, addressing temporal evolution of preferences, and developing scalable methods for preference elicitation.

Current research approaches span from direct comparison methods, such as measuring agreement rates between AI decisions and human expert judgments, to more sophisticated techniques that attempt to learn and model human preference structures. This includes work on inverse reinforcement learning from human demonstrations, active learning approaches for preference elicitation, and methods for aggregating preferences across multiple humans. Researchers are particularly focused on developing metrics that can capture nuanced aspects of human judgment, including context-dependency, uncertainty, and moral considerations.

A significant open challenge lies in developing agreement metrics that remain meaningful as AI systems tackle increasingly complex tasks where human preferences may be unclear or difficult to specify. This includes questions about how to handle cases where AI systems might identify solutions that humans hadn't considered, or where different groups of humans have conflicting preferences. Current research emphasizes the need for metrics that can capture both explicit stated preferences and implicit values, while remaining robust to potential biases in human judgment.
