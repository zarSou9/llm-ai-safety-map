### Mini Description

Metrics that evaluate how well system behavior matches intended objectives and constraints, including measures of value alignment and goal preservation under distribution shift.

### Description

Alignment Indicators focus on developing quantitative measures to evaluate how well an AI system's behavior aligns with its intended objectives and constraints. These metrics aim to capture both explicit alignment properties, such as adherence to specified rules or optimization targets, and implicit alignment aspects like preservation of human values and avoidance of unintended consequences. A key challenge lies in creating indicators that can meaningfully assess alignment even as systems become more complex and operate in increasingly diverse contexts.

Current research approaches range from direct behavioral measures, such as comparing system outputs against human-labeled examples, to more sophisticated techniques that attempt to probe the system's internal decision-making processes and value representations. Researchers are particularly focused on developing indicators that can detect subtle forms of misalignment, including reward hacking, specification gaming, and goal drift under distribution shift. This includes methods for evaluating both task-specific alignment (how well the system performs its intended function) and broader value alignment (how well it respects human values and preferences).

A significant open challenge is the development of alignment indicators that remain valid and meaningful as AI systems approach or potentially exceed human-level capabilities in various domains. This includes questions about how to verify alignment in systems that may develop novel strategies or operate in ways that are difficult for humans to directly evaluate. Researchers are exploring approaches that combine multiple complementary indicators, including both empirical measurements and formal guarantees, to build more comprehensive alignment assessment frameworks.
