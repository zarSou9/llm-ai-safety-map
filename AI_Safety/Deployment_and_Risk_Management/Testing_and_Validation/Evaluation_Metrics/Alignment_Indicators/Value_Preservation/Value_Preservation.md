### Mini Description

Indicators that assess whether a system maintains intended values and priorities across different contexts and under distribution shift.

### Description

Value Preservation focuses on ensuring that AI systems maintain their intended values, priorities, and objectives across different contexts and environments, even as conditions diverge from training scenarios. This includes developing metrics and methods to detect and measure potential value drift, where a system's effective values may gradually shift away from its original specifications due to distribution changes, novel situations, or emergent behaviors.

A central challenge is defining and measuring value stability in a way that captures both explicit programmed values and implicit learned values. Researchers investigate how to verify that systems maintain appropriate priorities when faced with edge cases, novel scenarios, or potential conflicts between different objectives. This includes developing frameworks for testing value preservation under distribution shift and methods for detecting subtle forms of value drift that might occur during deployment.

Current research explores various approaches to measuring and ensuring value preservation, from formal methods that attempt to prove invariance properties, to empirical approaches that test system behavior across diverse scenarios. Key open questions include how to define robust metrics for value stability, how to detect early warning signs of value drift, and how to design systems that can adapt to new situations while maintaining core values. There is particular emphasis on developing methods that can scale to more capable systems where direct behavioral comparison may become increasingly difficult.
