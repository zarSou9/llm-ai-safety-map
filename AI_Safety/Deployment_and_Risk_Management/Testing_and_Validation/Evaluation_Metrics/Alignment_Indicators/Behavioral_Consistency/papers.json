    "title": "Measuring Error Alignment for Decision-Making Systems",
    "published_date": "2024-09-20",
    "abstract": "Given that AI systems are set to play a pivotal role in future decision-making processes, their trustworthiness and reliability are of critical concern. Due to their scale and complexity, modern AI systems resist direct interpretation, and alternative ways are needed to establish trust in those systems, and determine how well they align with human values. We argue that good measures of the information processing similarities between AI and humans, may be able to achieve these same ends. While Representational alignment (RA) approaches measure similarity between the internal states of two systems, the associated data can be expensive and difficult to collect for human systems. In contrast, Behavioural alignment (BA) comparisons are cheaper and easier, but questions remain as to their sensitivity and reliability. We propose two new behavioural alignment metrics misclassification agreement which measures the similarity between the errors of two systems on the same instances, and class-level error similarity which measures the similarity between the error distributions of two systems. We show that our metrics correlate well with RA metrics, and provide complementary information to another BA metric, within a range of domains, and set the scene for a new approach to value alignment."

    "title": "Sample-Efficient Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Dynamics Aware Rewards",
    "published_date": "2024-02-28",
    "abstract": "Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) aligns a robot behavior with human preferences via a reward function learned from binary feedback over agent behaviors. We show that dynamics-aware reward functions improve the sample efficiency of PbRL by an order of magnitude. In our experiments we iterate between: (1) learning a dynamics-aware state-action representation (z^{sa}) via a self-supervised temporal consistency task, and (2) bootstrapping the preference-based reward function from (z^{sa}), which results in faster policy learning and better final policy performance. For example, on quadruped-walk, walker-walk, and cheetah-run, with 50 preference labels we achieve the same performance as existing approaches with 500 preference labels, and we recover 83\\% and 66\\% of ground truth reward policy performance versus only 38\\% and 21\\%. The performance gains demonstrate the benefits of explicitly learning a dynamics-aware reward model. Repo: \\texttt{https://github.com/apple/ml-reed}.",

    "title": "Value Alignment and Trust in Human-Robot Interaction: Insights from Simulation and User Study",
    "published_date": "2024-05-28",
    "abstract": "With the advent of AI technologies, humans and robots are increasingly teaming up to perform collaborative tasks. To enable smooth and effective collaboration, the topic of value alignment (operationalized herein as the degree of dynamic goal alignment within a task) between the robot and the human is gaining increasing research attention. Prior literature on value alignment makes an inherent assumption that aligning the values of the robot with that of the human benefits the team. This assumption, however, has not been empirically verified. Moreover, prior literature does not account for human's trust in the robot when analyzing human-robot value alignment. Thus, a research gap needs to be bridged by answering two questions: How does alignment of values affect trust? Is it always beneficial to align the robot's values with that of the human? We present a simulation study and a human-subject study to answer these questions. Results from the simulation study show that alignment of values is important for trust when the overall risk level of the task is high. We also present an adaptive strategy for the robot that uses Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to match the values of the robot with those of the human during interaction. Our simulations suggest that such an adaptive strategy is able to maintain trust across the full spectrum of human values. We also present results from an empirical study that validate these findings from simulation. Results indicate that real-time personalized value alignment is beneficial to trust and perceived performance by the human when the robot does not have a good prior on the human's values."

    "title": "Imitating Cost-Constrained Behaviors in Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2024-03-26",
    "abstract": "Complex planning and scheduling problems have long been solved using various optimization or heuristic approaches. In recent years, imitation learning that aims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable alternative to solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning is designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the behavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation primarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the vehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is governed not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints. For instance, decisions on self-driving delivery vehicles are dependent not only on the route preferences/rewards (depending on past demand data) but also on the fuel in the vehicle and the time available. In such problems, imitation learning is challenging as decisions are not only dictated by the reward model but are also dependent on a cost-constrained model. In this paper, we provide multiple methods that match expert distributions in the presence of trajectory cost constraints through (a) Lagrangian-based method; (b) Meta-gradients to find a good trade-off between expected return and minimizing constraint violation; and (c) Cost-violation-based alternating gradient. We empirically show that leading imitation learning approaches imitate cost-constrained behaviors poorly and our meta-gradient-based approach achieves the best performance.",

    "title": "Behavior Alignment via Reward Function Optimization",
    "published_date": "2023-10-29",
    "abstract": "Designing reward functions for efficiently guiding reinforcement learning (RL) agents toward specific behaviors is a complex task. This is challenging since it requires the identification of reward structures that are not sparse and that avoid inadvertently inducing undesirable behaviors. Naively modifying the reward structure to offer denser and more frequent feedback can lead to unintended outcomes and promote behaviors that are not aligned with the designer's intended goal. Although potential-based reward shaping is often suggested as a remedy, we systematically investigate settings where deploying it often significantly impairs performance. To address these issues, we introduce a new framework that uses a bi-level objective to learn \\emph{behavior alignment reward functions}. These functions integrate auxiliary rewards reflecting a designer's heuristics and domain knowledge with the environment's primary rewards. Our approach automatically determines the most effective way to blend these types of feedback, thereby enhancing robustness against heuristic reward misspecification. Remarkably, it can also adapt an agent's policy optimization process to mitigate suboptimalities resulting from limitations and biases inherent in the underlying RL algorithms. We evaluate our method's efficacy on a diverse set of tasks, from small-scale experiments to high-dimensional control challenges. We investigate heuristic auxiliary rewards of varying quality -- some of which are beneficial and others detrimental to the learning process. Our results show that our framework offers a robust and principled way to integrate designer-specified heuristics. It not only addresses key shortcomings of existing approaches but also consistently leads to high-performing solutions, even when given misaligned or poorly-specified auxiliary reward functions.",

    "title": "Active Reward Learning from Multiple Teachers",
    "published_date": "2023-03-02",
    "abstract": "Reward learning algorithms utilize human feedback to infer a reward function, which is then used to train an AI system. This human feedback is often a preference comparison, in which the human teacher compares several samples of AI behavior and chooses which they believe best accomplishes the objective. While reward learning typically assumes that all feedback comes from a single teacher, in practice these systems often query multiple teachers to gather sufficient training data. In this paper, we investigate this disparity, and find that algorithmic evaluation of these different sources of feedback facilitates more accurate and efficient reward learning. We formally analyze the value of information (VOI) when reward learning from teachers with varying levels of rationality, and define and evaluate an algorithm that utilizes this VOI to actively select teachers to query for feedback. Surprisingly, we find that it is often more informative to query comparatively irrational teachers. By formalizing this problem and deriving an analytical solution, we hope to facilitate improvement in reward learning approaches to aligning AI behavior with human values.",
