### Mini Description

Measures that quantify system stability under perturbations, including resistance to adversarial attacks and performance degradation under distribution shift.

### Description

Robustness metrics in AI safety focus on quantifying an AI system's ability to maintain reliable and safe performance across varying conditions, perturbations, and adversarial scenarios. These metrics aim to measure how well systems handle distribution shifts, maintain performance bounds under stress, and resist both intentional and unintentional corrupting influences. The development of such metrics requires careful consideration of different types of robustness, from local stability around training points to global behavioral consistency across deployment contexts.

A key challenge in developing robustness metrics lies in balancing different forms of robustness and understanding their trade-offs. For instance, resistance to adversarial attacks might come at the cost of reduced performance on natural inputs, or robustness to distribution shift might trade off against sample efficiency. Researchers work to develop metrics that can capture these nuanced relationships while remaining computationally tractable and practically meaningful for real-world applications.

Current research emphasizes the need for robustness metrics that scale to large models and complex domains while providing actionable insights for improvement. This includes developing methods to estimate worst-case performance bounds, quantify the size of safe operational envelopes, and measure the degradation of system capabilities under various forms of stress. There is particular interest in metrics that can predict robustness failures before they occur in deployment, as well as measures that can verify robustness properties across different levels of system capability.
