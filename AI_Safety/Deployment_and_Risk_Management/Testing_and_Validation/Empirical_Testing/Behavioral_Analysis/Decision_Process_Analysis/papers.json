    "title": "From DDMs to DNNs: Using process data and models of decision-making to improve human-AI interactions",
    "published_date": "2023-08-29",
    "abstract": "Over the past decades, cognitive neuroscientists and behavioral economists have recognized the value of describing the process of decision making in detail and modeling the emergence of decisions over time. For example, the time it takes to decide can reveal more about an agent's true hidden preferences than only the decision itself. Similarly, data that track the ongoing decision process such as eye movements or neural recordings contain critical information that can be exploited, even if no decision is made. Here, we argue that artificial intelligence (AI) research would benefit from a stronger focus on insights about how decisions emerge over time and incorporate related process data to improve AI predictions in general and human-AI interactions in particular. First, we introduce a highly established computational framework that assumes decisions to emerge from the noisy accumulation of evidence, and we present related empirical work in psychology, neuroscience, and economics. Next, we discuss to what extent current approaches in multi-agent AI do or do not incorporate process data and models of decision making. Finally, we outline how a more principled inclusion of the evidence-accumulation framework into the training and use of AI can help to improve human-AI interactions in the future."

    "published_date": "2021-01-05",
    "abstract": "Monitoring of students behavior in school needs further consideration in order to lessen the number of casualties in every term. The study designs a data driven decision support on students behavior utilizing Fuzzy Based Approach. The study successfully produces common behavioral problems of the student and able to give interventions for the improvement of students behavior. Student behavioral problems identified were absenteeism, tardiness and poor academic performance."

    "title": "Behavioural Analytics: Exploring judgments and choices in large data sets",
    "abstract": "Abstract The ever-increasing availability of large data-sets that store users' judgements (such as forecasts and preferences) and choices (such as acquisitions of goods and services) provides a fertile ground for Behavioural Operational Research (BOR). In this paper, we review the streams of Behavioural Decision Research that might be useful for BOR researchers and practitioners to analyse such behavioural data-sets. We then suggest ways that concepts from these streams can be employed in exploring behavioural data-sets for (i) detecting behavioural patterns, (ii) exploiting behavioural findings and (iii) improving judgements and decisions of consumers and citizens. We also illustrate how this taxonomy for behavioural analytics might be utilised in practice, in three real-world studies with behavioural data-sets generated by websites and online user activity.",

    "title": "The Ladder Theory of Behavioral Decision Making",
    "published_date": "2018-09-07",
    "abstract": "We study individual decision-making behavioral on generic view. Using a formal mathematical model, we investigate the action mechanism of decision behavioral under subjective perception changing of task attributes. Our model is built on work in two kinds classical behavioral decision making theory: \"prospect theory (PT)\" and \"image theory (IT)\". We consider subjective attributes preference of decision maker under the whole decision process. Strategies collection and selection mechanism are induced according the description of multi-attributes decision making. A novel behavioral decision-making framework named \"ladder theory (LT)\" is proposed. By real four cases comparing, the results shows that the LT have better explanation and prediction ability then PT and IT under some decision situations. Furthermore, we use our model to shed light on that the LT theory can cover PT and IT ideally. It is the enrichment and development for classical behavioral decision theory and, it has positive theoretical value and instructive significance for explaining plenty of real decision-making phenomena. It may facilitate our understanding of how individual decision-making performed actually."

    "title": "Behavioural decision theory and it's implication for knowledge engineering",
    "abstract": "Abstract This paper explores the implications of research results in behavioural decision theory on knowledge engineering. Behavioural decision theory, with its performance (versus process) orientation, can tell us a great deal about the validity of human expert knowledge, and when it should be modelled. A brief history of behavioural decision theory is provided. Implications for knowledge elicitation and representation are discussed. An approach to knowledge engineering is proposed that takes into account these implications.",
