    "title": "Scalable and Decentralized Algorithms for Anomaly Detection via Learning-Based Controlled Sensing",
    "published_date": "2021-12-08",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of sequentially selecting and observing processes from a given set to find the anomalies among them. The decision-maker observes a subset of the processes at any given time instant and obtains a noisy binary indicator of whether or not the corresponding process is anomalous. We develop an anomaly detection algorithm that chooses the processes to be observed at a given time instant, decides when to stop taking observations, and declares the decision on anomalous processes. The objective of the detection algorithm is to identify the anomalies with an accuracy exceeding the desired value while minimizing the delay in decision making. We devise a centralized algorithm where the processes are jointly selected by a common agent as well as a decentralized algorithm where the decision of whether to select a process is made independently for each process. Our algorithms rely on a Markov decision process defined using the marginal probability of each process being normal or anomalous, conditioned on the observations. We implement the detection algorithms using the deep actor-critic reinforcement learning framework. Unlike prior work on this topic that has exponential complexity in the number of processes, our algorithms have computational and memory requirements that are both polynomial in the number of processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of these algorithms using numerical experiments by comparing them with state-of-the-art methods.",

    "title": "Anomaly Rule Detection in Sequence Data",
    "published_date": "2021-11-29",
    "abstract": "Analyzing sequence data usually leads to the discovery of interesting patterns and then anomaly detection. In recent years, numerous frameworks and methods have been proposed to discover interesting patterns in sequence data as well as detect anomalous behavior. However, existing algorithms mainly focus on frequency-driven analytics, and they are challenging to be applied in real-world settings. In this work, we present a new anomaly detection framework called DUOS that enables Discovery of Utility-aware Outlier Sequential rules from a set of sequences. In this pattern-based anomaly detection algorithm, we incorporate both the anomalousness and utility of a group, and then introduce the concept of utility-aware outlier sequential rule (UOSR). We show that this is a more meaningful way for detecting anomalies. Besides, we propose some efficient pruning strategies w.r.t. upper bounds for mining UOSR, as well as the outlier detection. An extensive experimental study conducted on several real-world datasets shows that the proposed DUOS algorithm has a better effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, DUOS outperforms the baseline algorithm and has a suitable scalability.",

    "title": "An Auto Encoder Network Based Method for Abnormal behavior detection",
    "abstract": "With the continuous development of wireless communication technology and positioning technology, the acquisition of spatiotemporal trajectory data has become easier. Through data mining, discovering valuable knowledge hidden in trajectory data can be widely used in activities recommendation, urban planning, military and other fields, which has important research value. So this paper studies the behavior mining technology for trajectory data, the main contents is abnormal behavior detection based on deep learning. A trajectory anomaly detection algorithm based on variational self-encoding network is proposed. This method uses GRU as the basic unit of encoding and decoding, the reconstruction probability as the anomaly score. The proportion of suspected anomalies is introduced to adaptively adjust the abnormality judgment threshold. From the experiment, the accuracy and recall rate of the anomaly detection algorithm are both higher than 90%, and the real-time detection efficiency is high, which can meet the needs in actual scenarios.",

    "title": "Anomaly Detection Methods for Categorical Data",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection has numerous applications in diverse fields. For example, it has been widely used for discovering network intrusions and malicious events. It has also been used in numerous other applications such as identifying medical malpractice or credit fraud. Detection of anomalies in quantitative data has received a considerable attention in the literature and has a venerable history. By contrast, and despite the widespread availability use of categorical data in practice, anomaly detection in categorical data has received relatively little attention as compared to quantitative data. This is because detection of anomalies in categorical data is a challenging problem. Some anomaly detection techniques depend on identifying a representative pattern then measuring distances between objects and this pattern. Objects that are far from this pattern are declared as anomalies. However, identifying patterns and measuring distances are not easy in categorical data compared with quantitative data. Fortunately, several papers focussing on the detection of anomalies in categorical data have been published in the recent literature. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the research on the anomaly detection problem in categorical data. Previous review articles focus on either the statistics literature or the machine learning and computer science literature. This review article combines both literatures. We review 36 methods for the detection of anomalies in categorical data in both literatures and classify them into 12 different categories based on the conceptual definition of anomalies they use. For each approach, we survey anomaly detection methods, and then show the similarities and differences among them. We emphasize two important issues, the number of parameters each method requires and its time complexity. The first issue is critical, because the performance of these methods are sensitive to the choice of these parameters. The time complexity is also very important in real applications especially in big data applications. We report the time complexity if it is reported by the authors of the methods. If it is not, then we derive it ourselves and report it in this article. In addition, we discuss the common problems and the future directions of the anomaly detection in categorical data.",

    "title": "Bayesian Anomaly Detection Using Extreme Value Theory",
    "published_date": "2019-05-29",
    "abstract": "Data-driven anomaly detection methods typically build a model for the normal behavior of the target system, and score each data instance with respect to this model. A threshold is invariably needed to identify data instances with high (or low) scores as anomalies. This presents a practical limitation on the applicability of such methods, since most methods are sensitive to the choice of the threshold, and it is challenging to set optimal thresholds. We present a probabilistic framework to explicitly model the normal and anomalous behaviors and probabilistically reason about the data. An extreme value theory based formulation is proposed to model the anomalous behavior as the extremes of the normal behavior. As a specific instantiation, a joint non-parametric clustering and anomaly detection algorithm is proposed that models the normal behavior as a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model.",
