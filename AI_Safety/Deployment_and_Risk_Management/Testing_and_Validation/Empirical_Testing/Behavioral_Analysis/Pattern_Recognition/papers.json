    "abstract": "Abstract The paper presents the formalism of an intelligent decision-making system based on multi-agent neurocognitive architectures, which has an architectural similarity to the human brain. An invariant of the organizational and functional structure of the intellectual decision-making process based on the multi-agent neurocognitive architecture is developed. An algorithm for teaching intelligent decision-making systems based on the self-organization of the invariant of multi-agent neurocognitive architectures is presented. Using this algorithm, an intelligent agent was trained and the architecture of the learning process was built on the basis of an invariant of neurocognitive architecture. Further research is related to training an intelligent agent in more complex behavior and expanding the capabilities of an intelligent decision-making system based on multi-agent neurocognitive architectures.",

    "title": "Analysis patterns for learning agents",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on requirements analysis of agent based software development and introduce a set of patterns for analysis of (requirements for) learning agents. This paper also proposes a process for producing, evaluating and improving patterns that combines theoretical and practical approaches. Following this process, we first present the first version of our analysis pattern for learning agents. Then applicability of the pattern is investigated through the development of three case studies. The results of evaluating this pattern (via comparing it with a conventional approach) are presented and they are used to improve the pattern and introduce a new version. In order to decrease the complexity of the pattern and increasing its reusability, we also decompose the second version of the pattern into a set of patterns which introduces the third version.",
