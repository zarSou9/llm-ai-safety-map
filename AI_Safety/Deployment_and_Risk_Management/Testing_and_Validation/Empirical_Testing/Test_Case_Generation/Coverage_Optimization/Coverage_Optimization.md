### Mini Description

Strategies for maximizing test coverage across input spaces and behavior modes while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Description

Coverage Optimization in AI safety testing focuses on developing strategies to efficiently explore and validate system behavior across the vast space of possible inputs and scenarios. The fundamental challenge lies in achieving meaningful coverage of system behaviors while managing computational resources, as exhaustive testing is typically intractable for complex AI systems. This requires careful consideration of what constitutes adequate coverage and how to measure progress toward coverage goals.

Researchers employ various metrics and techniques to quantify and optimize coverage, from traditional code coverage measures adapted for neural networks to novel approaches based on behavioral clustering and semantic similarity. Key strategies include identifying representative subsets of input spaces, prioritizing high-risk or safety-critical regions, and developing adaptive sampling methods that dynamically adjust based on discovered behaviors or failure modes.

Current research challenges include developing coverage metrics that meaningfully correlate with safety properties, balancing exploration of known risk areas with discovery of novel failure modes, and scaling coverage optimization techniques to increasingly complex AI systems. There is particular interest in methods that can provide statistical guarantees about coverage completeness and techniques for combining multiple coverage criteria to achieve more comprehensive testing.
