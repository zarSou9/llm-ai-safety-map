    "title": "A Semantic-based Multi-agent Dynamic Interaction Model",
    "abstract": "Due to the autonomy of agents and their ability to perceive the environment, multi-agent systems have been widely used in many fields. The design of multi-agent systems requires the support of interactive models. The traditional multi-agent interaction model has certain feasibility in solving specific tasks. However, in a distributed environment, a relatively static multi-agent interaction model is not sufficient to support a dynamically changing interaction process. Frequent data interactions will also consume resources of multi-agent systems, thereby reducing agent performance. In this study, we propose a semantic-based multiagent dynamic interaction model (MADIM). MADIM uses semantic ontology to map the objects in the interaction model, and defines the interaction protocol through the rule description language. This model is attached with dynamically configurable semantic templates and interaction rule base. We added a reusable dynamic resolution engine component to MADIM to provide dynamic resolution services for the semantic information in the model. MADIM supports dynamic interactive behavior and has good interoperability and interpretability. Our model provides a flexible solution to the multi-agent interaction process. Finally, we verified the feasibility of the model design scheme through a simple example.",

    "title": "Efficient Direct Agent Interaction in Optimistic Distributed Multi-Agent-System Simulations",
    "abstract": "Agent-to-agent communications is an important operation in multi-agent systems and their simulation. Given the data-centric nature of agent-simulations, direct agent-to-agent communication is generally an orthogonal operation to accessing shared data in the simulation. In distributed multi-agent-system simulations in particular, implementing direct agent-to-agent communication may impose serious performance degradation due to potentially large communication and synchronization overheads. In this paper, we propose an efficient agent-to-agent communication method in the context of optimistic distributed simulation of multi-agent systems. An implementation of the proposed method is demonstrated and quantitatively evaluated through its integration into the PDES-MAS simulation kernel.",

    "title": "Deep Integration of Physical Humanoid Control and Crowd Navigation",
    "abstract": "Many multi-agent navigation approaches make use of simplified representations such as a disk. These simplifications allow for fast simulation of thousands of agents but limit the simulation accuracy and fidelity. In this paper, we propose a fully integrated physical character control and multi-agent navigation method. In place of sample complex online planning methods, we extend the use of recent deep reinforcement learning techniques. This extension improves on multi-agent navigation models and simulated humanoids by combining Multi-Agent and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. We train a single short term goal-conditioned low-level policy to provide directed walking behaviour. This task-agnostic controller can be shared by higher-level policies that perform longer-term planning. The proposed approach produces reciprocal collision avoidance, robust navigation, and emergent crowd behaviours. Furthermore, it offers several key affordances not previously possible in multi-agent navigation including tunable character morphology and physically accurate interactions with agents and the environment. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms prior methods across environments and tasks, as well as, performing well in terms of zero-shot generalization over different numbers of agents and computation time.",

    "title": "A generative simulation platform for multi-agent systems with incentives",
    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems have attracted much attention in the recent years due to their capabilities to handle complex and computation-heavy tasks and compatibility with incentive schemes. Considering the difficulty of creating an actual prototype and environment for evaluation, a simulation platform is a cheap and efficient way in analyzing and testing, prior to real environmental implementations. Existing simulators for multi-agent systems are inadequate to analyze the effects of different customized incentive schemes on agents' behavior patterns due to two reasons: 1) They lack the functionality to support various types of complex incentives, e.g., mixture of monetary incentives and non-monetary incentives, which influences agents' behaviors explicitly and implicitly; 2) They are not able to emulate heterogeneous agents' realtime behaviors that are influenced by complex incentives and deviate from their original behavior patterns shown in historical traces. In this paper, we focus on mobile agents that can move in a patio-temporal space, and we present a physical knowledge aided multi-agent simulation platform considering the influence of both direct and indirect incentives unified through a general utility-driven agent reaction function. The behaviors of agents are then emulated in three behavioral models: myopic, semi-myopic, and farsighted, by varying the assumption of agents in maximizing their utilities and integrating the physical knowledge and historical mobility patterns. We finally examine the effectiveness of the platform in incentivizing vehicle agents to optimize the final distribution of the agents through a ride-sharing vehicle experimental scenario. The emulated agents' behaviors can also be collected into data traces for analyzing other patterns of the agents.",
