    "title": "Consumer Transactions Simulation through Generative Adversarial Networks",
    "published_date": "2024-08-07",
    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving domain of large-scale retail data systems, envisioning and simulating future consumer transactions has become a crucial area of interest. It offers significant potential to fortify demand forecasting and fine-tune inventory management. This paper presents an innovative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic retail transaction data, specifically focusing on a novel system architecture that combines consumer behavior modeling with stock-keeping unit (SKU) availability constraints to address real-world assortment optimization challenges. We diverge from conventional methodologies by integrating SKU data into our GAN architecture and using more sophisticated embedding methods (e.g., hyper-graphs). This design choice enables our system to generate not only simulated consumer purchase behaviors but also reflects the dynamic interplay between consumer behavior and SKU availability -- an aspect often overlooked, among others, because of data scarcity in legacy retail simulation models. Our GAN model generates transactions under stock constraints, pioneering a resourceful experimental system with practical implications for real-world retail operation and strategy. Preliminary results demonstrate enhanced realism in simulated transactions measured by comparing generated items with real ones using methods employed earlier in related studies. This underscores the potential for more accurate predictive modeling."

    "title": "KIPPS: Knowledge infusion in Privacy Preserving Synthetic Data Generation",
    "published_date": "2024-09-25",
    "abstract": "The integration of privacy measures, including differential privacy techniques, ensures a provable privacy guarantee for the synthetic data. However, challenges arise for Generative Deep Learning models when tasked with generating realistic data, especially in critical domains such as Cybersecurity and Healthcare. Generative Models optimized for continuous data struggle to model discrete and non-Gaussian features that have domain constraints. Challenges increase when the training datasets are limited and not diverse. In such cases, generative models create synthetic data that repeats sensitive features, which is a privacy risk. Moreover, generative models face difficulties comprehending attribute constraints in specialized domains. This leads to the generation of unrealistic data that impacts downstream accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel model, KIPPS, that infuses Domain and Regulatory Knowledge from Knowledge Graphs into Generative Deep Learning models for enhanced Privacy Preserving Synthetic data generation. The novel framework augments the training of generative models with supplementary context about attribute values and enforces domain constraints during training. This added guidance enhances the model's capacity to generate realistic and domain-compliant synthetic data. The proposed model is evaluated on real-world datasets, specifically in the domains of Cybersecurity and Healthcare, where domain constraints and rules add to the complexity of the data. Our experiments evaluate the privacy resilience and downstream accuracy of the model against benchmark methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the balance between privacy preservation and data accuracy in complex domains.",

    "title": "RealGen: Retrieval Augmented Generation for Controllable Traffic Scenarios",
    "published_date": "2023-12-19",
    "abstract": "Simulation plays a crucial role in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to the potential risks associated with real-world testing. Although significant progress has been made in the visual aspects of simulators, generating complex behavior among agents remains a formidable challenge. It is not only imperative to ensure realism in the scenarios generated but also essential to incorporate preferences and conditions to facilitate controllable generation for AV training and evaluation. Traditional methods, mainly relying on memorizing the distribution of training datasets, often fall short in generating unseen scenarios. Inspired by the success of retrieval augmented generation in large language models, we present RealGen, a novel retrieval-based in-context learning framework for traffic scenario generation. RealGen synthesizes new scenarios by combining behaviors from multiple retrieved examples in a gradient-free way, which may originate from templates or tagged scenarios. This in-context learning framework endows versatile generative capabilities, including the ability to edit scenarios, compose various behaviors, and produce critical scenarios. Evaluations show that RealGen offers considerable flexibility and controllability, marking a new direction in the field of controllable traffic scenario generation.

    "title": "Automated Software Test Data Generation With Generative Adversarial Networks",
    "abstract": "With the rapid increase of software scale and complexity, the cost of traditional software testing methods will increase faster than the scale of software. In order to improve test efficiency, it is particularly important to automatically generate high-quality test cases. This paper introduces a framework for automatic test data generation based on the generative adversarial network (GAN). GAN is employed to train a generative model over execution path information to learn the behavior of the software. Then we can use the trained generative model to produce new test data, and select the test data that can improve the branch coverage according to our proposed selection strategy. Compared to prior work, our proposed method is able to handle programs under test with large-scale branches without analyzing branch expressions. In the experiment, we exhibit the performance of our method by using two modules in GNU Scientific Library. In particular, we consider the application of our method in two testing scenarios; unit testing and integration testing, and conduct a series of experiments to compare the performance of three types of GAN models. Results indicate that the WGAN-GP shows the best performance in our framework. Compared with the random testing method, the WGAN-GP based framework improves the test coverage of five functions out of the seven in the unit testing.",

    "title": "CTAB-GAN: Effective Table Data Synthesizing",
    "published_date": "2021-02-16",
    "abstract": "While data sharing is crucial for knowledge development, privacy concerns and strict regulation (e.g., European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) unfortunately limit its full effectiveness. Synthetic tabular data emerges as an alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory and privacy constraints. The state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies from generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and address two main data types in the industry, i.e., continuous and categorical. In this paper, we develop CTAB-GAN, a novel conditional table GAN architecture that can effectively model diverse data types, including a mix of continuous and categorical variables. Moreover, we address data imbalance and long-tail issues, i.e., certain variables have drastic frequency differences across large values. To achieve those aims, we first introduce the information loss and classification loss to the conditional GAN. Secondly, we design a novel conditional vector, which efficiently encodes the mixed data type and skewed distribution of data variable. We extensively evaluate CTAB-GAN with the state of the art GANs that generate synthetic tables, in terms of data similarity and analysis utility. The results on five datasets show that the synthetic data of CTAB-GAN remarkably resembles the real data for all three types of variables and results into higher accuracy for five machine learning algorithms, by up to 17%.",

    "abstract": "With the demand of integrated energy metering business and the rise of artificial intelligence technology, the data generation model of digital equipment has become the focus of attention. As the most widely used method in the field of image generation, the implicit method based on GAN has great development potential and strong domain expansion ability. The addition of reinforcement learning method makes the GAN correlation algorithm suitable for data generation of discrete data. This paper proposes an improved SeqGAN model, reconstructs the original SeqGAN model, improves the roll-out module of the original model, uses model parameters lagging behind the generator, and increases the stability of long sequence reinforcement learning. Compared with some existing popular algorithms, the performance of the proposed model algorithm is significantly better than that of the comparison algorithm when the training times are enough (more than 150 times), which lays a foundation for its application in data generation of digital equipment.",
