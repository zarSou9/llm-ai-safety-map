### Mini Description

Techniques that learn to generate scenarios from real-world data or existing test cases, including generative models and methods for synthesizing variations of observed scenarios.

### Description

Data-driven Generation focuses on leveraging existing datasets and real-world examples to create realistic and meaningful test scenarios for AI systems. This approach combines machine learning techniques with domain expertise to learn the underlying patterns and structures of valid scenarios, enabling the generation of new test cases that maintain important properties and constraints of the problem domain. The field encompasses both supervised approaches that directly learn from labeled examples and unsupervised methods that discover latent patterns in unlabeled data.

A central challenge is ensuring that generated scenarios maintain semantic validity while introducing meaningful variations. This requires sophisticated modeling approaches that can capture both the explicit rules and implicit constraints of the domain. Researchers employ various techniques including deep generative models, constraint satisfaction methods, and hybrid approaches that combine learned patterns with explicit domain knowledge. Special attention is paid to maintaining diversity in generated scenarios while avoiding unrealistic or physically impossible situations.

Current research focuses on improving the controllability and interpretability of generation processes, developing methods for conditional generation based on specific test objectives, and creating techniques for validating the quality of generated scenarios. Key areas of investigation include methods for handling multiple modalities of data, approaches for generating edge cases while maintaining realism, and techniques for incorporating human feedback into the generation process. There is particular interest in developing methods that can efficiently generate scenarios that probe specific aspects of system behavior or target known weaknesses.
