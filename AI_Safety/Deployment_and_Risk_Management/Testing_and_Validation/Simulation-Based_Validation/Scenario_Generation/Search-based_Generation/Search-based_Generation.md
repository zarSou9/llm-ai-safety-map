### Mini Description

Methods that use optimization and search algorithms to systematically explore the scenario space and identify relevant test cases, including genetic algorithms and gradient-based approaches.

### Description

Search-based Generation in AI safety testing employs algorithmic approaches to systematically explore and optimize the space of possible test scenarios. These methods typically define an objective function that captures desired scenario properties (such as difficulty, novelty, or likelihood of exposing failures) and use various search algorithms to find scenarios that maximize this objective. The approach enables both broad exploration of the scenario space and focused investigation of specific regions of interest.

A key challenge in search-based generation is designing effective objective functions and search spaces. The objective function must balance multiple competing goals, such as scenario realism, diversity, and relevance to safety testing. The search space must be structured to allow efficient exploration while maintaining scenario validity. This has led to the development of specialized representations and constraints that encode domain knowledge about valid scenarios.

Current research focuses on improving the scalability and efficiency of search algorithms, developing more sophisticated objective functions that better capture safety-relevant properties, and creating hybrid approaches that combine search with other generation techniques. There is particular interest in methods that can adaptively guide the search based on previous testing results and system behavior, as well as approaches that can handle high-dimensional and structured scenario spaces.
