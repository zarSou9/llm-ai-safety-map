### Mini Description

Methods for creating simplified representations of complex systems that preserve essential safety properties while reducing verification complexity.

### Description

Abstraction Techniques in scalable verification focus on creating simplified representations of complex AI systems while preserving essential safety-relevant properties. These techniques aim to reduce the computational complexity of verification tasks by identifying and isolating the core aspects of system behavior that are relevant to specific safety properties, while safely abstracting away less critical details. This allows for more tractable verification processes while maintaining meaningful safety guarantees.

Key approaches include methods for abstracting continuous state spaces into discrete representations, techniques for summarizing network behavior through interval analysis or symbolic representations, and approaches for identifying and leveraging symmetries or invariants in system behavior. Recent advances have focused on developing adaptive abstraction methods that can automatically adjust the level of detail based on verification requirements, as well as techniques for maintaining sound abstractions in the presence of learning or adaptation.

Current research challenges include developing abstraction techniques that can handle the complex architectures of modern AI systems, methods for automatically discovering useful abstractions, and approaches for quantifying the trade-offs between abstraction fidelity and verification tractability. There is particular interest in techniques that can provide formal guarantees about the relationship between system properties in the abstract and concrete domains, ensuring that verification results on simplified models transfer meaningfully to the full system.
