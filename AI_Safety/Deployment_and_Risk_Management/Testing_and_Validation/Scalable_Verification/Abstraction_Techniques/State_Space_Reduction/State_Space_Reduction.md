### Mini Description

Methods for simplifying the representation of system states while preserving safety-relevant properties, including discretization techniques and dimensional reduction approaches.

### Description

State Space Reduction focuses on techniques for simplifying the representation of AI system states while maintaining the ability to verify critical safety properties. The fundamental challenge lies in identifying which aspects of the state space are essential for safety verification and which can be safely abstracted away, allowing for more tractable analysis without compromising the validity of verification results.

Key approaches include partitioning techniques that group similar states based on equivalence relations, projection methods that eliminate irrelevant dimensions while preserving safety-critical features, and quantization strategies that discretize continuous state spaces with formal guarantees. Recent advances have focused on adaptive techniques that can automatically adjust the granularity of state space representation based on the specific verification properties being checked and the local complexity of system behavior.

Current research challenges include developing methods for handling high-dimensional state spaces in deep neural networks, techniques for maintaining sound reductions when system behavior exhibits complex temporal dependencies, and approaches for automatically discovering efficient state space representations that preserve verification properties. There is particular interest in methods that can provide formal guarantees about the relationship between properties in the reduced and original state spaces while scaling to practical applications.
