    "title": "Art: Abstraction Refinement-Guided Training for Provably Correct Neural Networks",
    "published_date": "2019-07-17",
    "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility in various challenging machine learning applications. While formally verified properties of their behaviors are highly desired, they have proven notoriously difficult to derive and enforce. Existing approaches typically formulate this problem as a post facto analysis process. In this paper, we present a novel learning framework that ensures such formal guarantees are enforced by construction. Our technique enables training provably correct networks with respect to a broad class of safety properties, a capability that goes well-beyond existing approaches, without compromising much accuracy. Our key insight is that we can integrate an optimization-based abstraction refinement loop into the learning process and operate over dynamically constructed partitions of the input space that considers accuracy and safety objectives synergistically. The refinement procedure iteratively splits the input space from which training data is drawn, guided by the efficacy with which such partitions enable safety verification. We have implemented our approach in a tool (ART) and applied it to enforce general safety properties on unmanned aviator collision avoidance system ACAS Xu dataset and the Collision Detection dataset. Importantly, we empirically demonstrate that realizing safety does not come at the price of much accuracy. Our methodology demonstrates that an abstraction refinement methodology provides a meaningful pathway for building both accurate and correct machine learning networks.",

    "title": "Safe Reach Set Computation via Neural Barrier Certificates",
    "published_date": "2024-04-29",
    "abstract": "We present a novel technique for online safety verification of autonomous systems, which performs reachability analysis efficiently for both bounded and unbounded horizons by employing neural barrier certificates. Our approach uses barrier certificates given by parameterized neural networks that depend on a given initial set, unsafe sets, and time horizon. Such networks are trained efficiently offline using system simulations sampled from regions of the state space. We then employ a meta-neural network to generalize the barrier certificates to state space regions that are outside the training set. These certificates are generated and validated online as sound over-approximations of the reachable states, thus either ensuring system safety or activating appropriate alternative actions in unsafe scenarios. We demonstrate our technique on case studies from linear models to nonlinear control-dependent models for online autonomous driving scenarios.",

    "title": "VeriCompress: A Tool to Streamline the Synthesis of Verified Robust Compressed Neural Networks from Scratch",
    "published_date": "2022-11-17",
    "abstract": "AI's widespread integration has led to neural networks (NN) deployment on edge and similar limited-resource platforms for safety-critical scenarios. Yet, NN's fragility raises concerns about reliable inference. Moreover, constrained platforms demand compact networks. This study introduces VeriCompress, a tool that automates the search and training of compressed models with robustness guarantees. These models are well-suited for safety-critical applications and adhere to predefined architecture and size limitations, making them deployable on resource-restricted platforms. The method trains models 2-3 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches, surpassing them by average accuracy and robustness gains of 15.1 and 9.8 percentage points, respectively. When deployed on a resource-restricted generic platform, these models require 5-8 times less memory and 2-4 times less inference time than models used in verified robustness literature. Our comprehensive evaluation across various model architectures and datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR, SVHN, and a relevant pedestrian detection dataset, showcases VeriCompress's capacity to identify compressed verified robust models with reduced computation overhead compared to current standards. This underscores its potential as a valuable tool for end users, such as developers of safety-critical applications on edge or Internet of Things platforms, empowering them to create suitable models for safety-critical, resource-constrained platforms in their respective domains."

    "title": "Assured Neural Network Architectures for Control and Identification of Nonlinear Systems",
    "published_date": "2021-09-21",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of automatically designing a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Neural Network (NN) architecture (number of layers and number of neurons per layer) with the assurance that it is sufficiently parametrized to control a nonlinear system; i.e. control the system to satisfy a given formal specification. This is unlike current techniques, which provide no assurances on the resultant architecture. Moreover, our approach requires only limited knowledge of the underlying nonlinear system and specification. We assume only that the specification can be satisfied by a Lipschitz-continuous controller with a known bound on its Lipschitz constant; the specific controller need not be known. From this assumption, we bound the number of affine functions needed to construct a Continuous Piecewise Affine (CPWA) function that can approximate any Lipschitz-continuous controller that satisfies the specification. Then we connect this CPWA to a NN architecture using the authors' recent results on the Two-Level Lattice (TLL) NN architecture; the TLL architecture was shown to be parameterized by the number of affine functions present in the CPWA function it realizes."

    "title": "Infinite Time Horizon Safety of Bayesian Neural Networks",
    "published_date": "2021-11-04",
    "abstract": "Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) place distributions over the weights of a neural network to model uncertainty in the data and the network's prediction. We consider the problem of verifying safety when running a Bayesian neural network policy in a feedback loop with infinite time horizon systems. Compared to the existing sampling-based approaches, which are inapplicable to the infinite time horizon setting, we train a separate deterministic neural network that serves as an infinite time horizon safety certificate. In particular, we show that the certificate network guarantees the safety of the system over a subset of the BNN weight posterior's support. Our method first computes a safe weight set and then alters the BNN's weight posterior to reject samples outside this set. Moreover, we show how to extend our approach to a safe-exploration reinforcement learning setting, in order to avoid unsafe trajectories during the training of the policy. We evaluate our approach on a series of reinforcement learning benchmarks, including non-Lyapunovian safety specifications.",

    "title": "Safety-Assured Design and Adaptation of Learning-Enabled Autonomous Systems",
    "abstract": "Future autonomous systems will employ sophisticated machine learning techniques for the sensing and perception of the surroundings and the making corresponding decisions for planning, control, and other actions. They often operate in highly dynamic, uncertain and challenging environment, and need to meet stringent timing, resource, and mission requirements. In particular, it is critical and yet very challenging to ensure the safety of these autonomous systems, given the uncertainties of the system inputs, the constant disturbances on the system operations, and the lack of analyzability for many machine learning methods (particularly those based on neural networks). In this paper, we will discuss some of these challenges, and present our work in developing automated, quantitative, and formalized methods and tools for ensuring the safety of autonomous systems in their design and during their runtime adaptation. We argue that it is essential to take a holistic approach in addressing system safety and other safety-related properties, vertically across the functional, software, and hardware layers, and horizontally across the autonomy pipeline of sensing, perception, planning, and control modules. This approach could be further extended from a single autonomous system to a multi-agent system where multiple autonomous agents perform tasks in a collaborative manner. We will use connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as the main application domain to illustrate the importance of such holistic approach and show our initial efforts in this direction.",
