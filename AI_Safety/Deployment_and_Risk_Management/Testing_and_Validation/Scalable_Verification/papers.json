    "title": "Scalable Surrogate Verification of Image-based Neural Network Control Systems using Composition and Unrolling",
    "published_date": "2024-05-28",
    "abstract": "Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.",

    "title": "Meta-Sealing: A Revolutionizing Integrity Assurance Protocol for Transparent, Tamper-Proof, and Trustworthy AI System",
    "published_date": "2024-10-31",
    "abstract": "The Artificial intelligence in critical sectors-healthcare, finance, and public safety-has made system integrity paramount for maintaining societal trust. Current verification methods for AI systems lack comprehensive lifecycle assurance, creating significant vulnerabilities in deployment of both powerful and trustworthy AI. This research introduces Meta-Sealing, a cryptographic framework that fundamentally changes integrity verification in AI systems throughout their operational lifetime. Meta-Sealing surpasses traditional integrity protocols through its implementation of cryptographic seal chains, establishing verifiable, immutable records for all system decisions and transformations. The framework combines advanced cryptography with distributed verification, delivering tamper-evident guarantees that achieve both mathematical rigor and computational efficiency. Our implementation addresses urgent regulatory requirements for AI system transparency and auditability. The framework integrates with current AI governance standards, specifically the EU's AI Act and FDA's healthcare AI guidelines, enabling organizations to maintain operational efficiency while meeting compliance requirements. Testing on financial institution data demonstrated Meta-Sealing's capability to reduce audit timeframes by 62% while enhancing stakeholder confidence by 47%. Results can establish a new benchmark for integrity assurance in enterprise AI deployments. This research presents Meta-Sealing not merely as a technical solution, but as a foundational framework ensuring AI system integrity aligns with human values and regulatory requirements. As AI continues to influence critical decisions, provides the necessary bridge between technological advancement and verifiable trust. Meta-Sealing serves as a guardian of trust, ensuring that the AI systems we depend on are as reliable and transparent as they are powerful.",
    "summary": "Meta-Sealing is a novel cryptographic framework providing comprehensive, tamper-proof integrity assurance for AI systems throughout their lifecycle, using cryptographic seal chains to create verifiable records of all system actions and significantly improving audit efficiency and stakeholder trust. Its design aligns with existing AI governance regulations, enhancing transparency and compliance."

    "title": "Finding Safety Violations of AI-Enabled Control Systems through the Lens of Synthesized Proxy Programs",
    "published_date": "2024-10-07",
    "abstract": "Given the increasing adoption of modern AI-enabled control systems, ensuring their safety and reliability has become a critical task in software testing. One prevalent approach to testing control systems is falsification, which aims to find an input signal that causes the control system to violate a formal safety specification using optimization algorithms. However, applying falsification to AI-enabled control systems poses two significant challenges: (1)~it requires the system to execute numerous candidate test inputs, which can be time-consuming, particularly for systems with AI models that have many parameters, and (2)~multiple safety requirements are typically defined as a conjunctive specification, which is difficult for existing falsification approaches to comprehensively cover. This paper introduces Synthify, a falsification framework tailored for AI-enabled control systems. Our approach performs falsification in a two-phase process. At the start, Synthify synthesizes a program that implements one or a few linear controllers to serve as a proxy for the AI controller. This proxy program mimics the AI controller's functionality but is computationally more efficient. Then, Synthify employs the $\\epsilon$-greedy strategy to sample a promising sub-specification from the conjunctive safety specification. It then uses a Simulated Annealing-based falsification algorithm to find violations of the sampled sub-specification for the control system. To evaluate Synthify, we compare it to PSY-TaLiRo, a state-of-the-art and industrial-strength falsification tool, on 8 publicly available control systems. On average, Synthify achieves a 83.5% higher success rate in falsification compared to PSY-TaLiRo with the same budget of falsification trials. The safety violations found by Synthify are also more diverse than those found by PSY-TaLiRo, covering 137.7% more sub-specifications.",
    "summary": "Synthify is a novel falsification framework for AI-enabled control systems that uses synthesized proxy programs to efficiently find safety violations, outperforming state-of-the-art tools by achieving a significantly higher success rate and discovering more diverse violations. This is accomplished through a two-phase process involving proxy program synthesis and a targeted falsification algorithm."

    "title": "Hierarchical Distribution-aware Testing of Deep Learning",
    "published_date": "2022-05-17",
    "abstract": "With its growing use in safety/security-critical applications, Deep Learning (DL) has raised increasing concerns regarding its dependability. In particular, DL has a notorious problem of lacking robustness. Input added with adversarial perturbations, i.e., Adversarial Examples (AEs), are easily mispredicted by the DL model. Despite recent efforts made in detecting AEs via state-of-the-art attack and testing methods, they are normally input distribution–agnostic and/or disregard the perceptual quality of adversarial perturbations. Consequently, the detected AEs are irrelevant inputs in the application context or noticeably unrealistic to humans. This may lead to a limited effect on improving the DL model's dependability, as the testing budget is likely to be wasted on detecting AEs that are encountered very rarely in its real-life operations. In this article, we propose a new robustness testing approach for detecting AEs that considers both the feature-level distribution and the pixel-level distribution, capturing the perceptual quality of adversarial perturbations. The two considerations are encoded by a novel hierarchical mechanism. First, we select test seeds based on the density of feature-level distribution and the vulnerability of adversarial robustness. The vulnerability of test seeds is indicated by the auxiliary information, which are highly correlated with local robustness. Given a test seed, we then develop a novel genetic algorithm–based local test case generation method, in which two fitness functions work alternatively to control the perceptual quality of detected AEs. Finally, extensive experiments confirm that our holistic approach considering hierarchical distributions is superior to the state-of-the-arts that either disregard any input distribution or only consider a single (non-hierarchical) distribution, in terms of not only detecting imperceptible AEs but also improving the overall robustness of the DL model under testing.",

    "title": "Synthesizing Reactive Test Environments for Autonomous Systems: Testing Reach-Avoid Specifications with Multi-Commodity Flows",
    "published_date": "2022-10-19",
    "abstract": "We study automated test generation for testing discrete decision-making modules in autonomous systems. Linear temporal logic is used to encode the system specification - requirements of the system under test - and the test specification, which is unknown to the system and describes the desired test behavior. The reactive test synthesis problem is to find constraints on system actions such that in a test execution, both the system and test specifications are satisfied. To do this, we use the specifications and their corresponding Büchi automata to construct the specification product automaton. Then, a virtual product graph representing all possible test executions of the system is constructed from the transition system and the specification product automaton. The main result of this paper is framing the test synthesis problem as a multi-commodity network flow optimization. This optimization is used to derive reactive constraints on system actions, which constitute the test environment. The resulting test environment ensures that the system meets the test specification while also satisfying the system specification. We illustrate this framework in simulation using grid world examples and demonstrate it on hardware with the Unitree A1 quadruped, where we test dynamic locomotion behaviors reactively.",

    "title": "Abstraction and Refinement: Towards Scalable and Exact Verification of Neural Networks",
    "published_date": "2022-07-02",
    "abstract": "As a new programming paradigm, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly deployed in practice, but the lack of robustness hinders their applications in safety-critical domains. While there are techniques for verifying DNNs with formal guarantees, they are limited in scalability and accuracy. In this article, we present a novel counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) approach for scalable and exact verification of DNNs. Specifically, we propose a novel abstraction to break down the size of DNNs by over-approximation. The result of verifying the abstract DNN is conclusive if no spurious counterexample is reported. To eliminate each spurious counterexample introduced by abstraction, we propose a novel counterexample-guided refinement that refines the abstract DNN to exclude the spurious counterexample while still over-approximating the original one, leading to a sound, complete yet efficient CEGAR approach. Our approach is orthogonal to and can be integrated with many existing verification techniques. For demonstration, we implement our approach using two promising tools, Marabou and Planet, as the underlying verification engines, and evaluate on widely used benchmarks for three datasets ACAS, Xu, MNIST, and CIFAR-10. The results show that our approach can boost their performance by solving more problems in the same time limit, reducing on average 13.4%–86.3% verification time of Marabou on almost all the verification tasks, and reducing on average 8.3%–78.0% verification time of Planet on all the verification tasks. Compared to the most relevant CEGAR-based approach, our approach is 11.6–26.6 times faster.",
