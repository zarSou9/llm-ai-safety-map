### Mini Description

Methods for testing and validating increasingly complex AI systems, including compositional testing approaches and techniques for handling systems with emergent behaviors.

### Description

Scalable Verification addresses the fundamental challenge of validating increasingly complex AI systems as they grow in size, capability, and sophistication. Traditional verification methods often face computational barriers or become intractable when applied to large-scale neural networks, complex multi-agent systems, or systems exhibiting emergent behaviors. This has driven research into novel approaches that can maintain rigorous safety guarantees while scaling to meet the demands of modern AI architectures.

Key research directions include decomposition-based approaches that break down verification tasks into manageable components, abstraction techniques that preserve essential safety properties while reducing computational complexity, and methods for verifying systems during training rather than post-hoc. There is particular emphasis on developing verification techniques that can handle neural networks with millions or billions of parameters, as well as approaches for verifying properties of systems that may be too complex for humans to fully understand.

Current challenges include developing verification methods that can scale with model size while maintaining meaningful guarantees, handling the verification of systems with learned components or those that continue to learn during deployment, and creating approaches that can verify safety properties in the presence of uncertainty or distributional shift. The field increasingly recognizes the need to balance theoretical guarantees with practical computational constraints, leading to hybrid approaches that combine formal methods with statistical guarantees.
