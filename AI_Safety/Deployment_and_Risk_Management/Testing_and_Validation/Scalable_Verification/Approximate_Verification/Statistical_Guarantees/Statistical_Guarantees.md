### Mini Description

Methods using statistical sampling and hypothesis testing to provide probabilistic assurances about system behavior, including confidence intervals and probability bounds on safety properties.

### Description

Statistical Guarantees in AI safety verification focuses on developing rigorous probabilistic frameworks to establish confidence in system behavior when deterministic guarantees are infeasible. These methods leverage statistical theory to quantify uncertainty and provide probabilistic bounds on safety properties, enabling meaningful assurances even for complex systems where traditional formal verification becomes intractable.

Central to this field is the development of hypothesis testing frameworks adapted for AI systems, including sequential testing methods that can efficiently validate safety properties while minimizing computational overhead. Researchers work to establish theoretical foundations for determining appropriate sample sizes, confidence levels, and error bounds that maintain statistical validity while accounting for the unique challenges of AI systems, such as non-stationarity and distribution shift.

Key research challenges include developing methods to handle rare events and tail behaviors, establishing appropriate test statistics for complex safety properties, and creating frameworks that can provide meaningful guarantees with limited samples. There is particular focus on techniques that can adapt to different safety requirements and computational budgets while maintaining statistical rigor, as well as methods for combining multiple statistical tests while controlling for multiple hypothesis testing.
