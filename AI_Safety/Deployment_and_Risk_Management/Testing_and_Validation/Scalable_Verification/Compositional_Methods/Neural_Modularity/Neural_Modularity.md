### Mini Description

Techniques that leverage or impose modular structure in neural networks to enable compositional verification of learned components.

### Description

Neural Modularity focuses on leveraging and imposing modular structures within neural networks to enable more tractable verification of their properties and behaviors. This approach recognizes that while modern neural networks are typically treated as monolithic systems, introducing architectural constraints and training methods that encourage modularity can make verification more manageable through compositional reasoning. The field draws inspiration from both software engineering principles of modularity and neuroscientific evidence of functional specialization in biological neural systems.

A key research direction involves developing architecture patterns and training objectives that naturally decompose neural computation into distinct, verifiable modules while maintaining model performance. This includes techniques such as routing networks, mixture-of-experts architectures, and neural module networks where different components specialize in specific subtasks. Researchers explore methods for ensuring clean separation between modules, establishing clear interfaces, and maintaining verifiable properties during both training and inference.

Current challenges include balancing the trade-off between modularity and model performance, ensuring that modular boundaries remain meaningful under optimization, and developing verification techniques specifically suited for modular neural architectures. There is particular interest in approaches that can handle dynamic routing between modules, methods for verifying module composition under uncertainty, and techniques for ensuring that modular structures align with semantically meaningful decompositions of the target task.
