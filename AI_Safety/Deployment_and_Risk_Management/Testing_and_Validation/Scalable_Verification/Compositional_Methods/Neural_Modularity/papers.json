    "abstract": "Modular neural networks outperform nonmodular neural networks on tasks ranging from visual question answering to robotics. These performance improvements are thought to be due to modular networks' superior ability to model the compositional and combinatorial structure of real-world problems. However, a theoretical explanation of how modularity improves generalizability, and how to leverage task modularity while training networks remains elusive. Using recent theoretical progress in explaining neural network generalization, we investigate how the amount of training data required to generalize on a task varies with the intrinsic dimensionality of a task's input. We show theoretically that when applied to modularly structured tasks, while nonmodular networks require an exponential number of samples with task dimensionality, modular networks' sample complexity is independent of task dimensionality: modular networks can generalize in high dimensions. We then develop a novel learning rule for modular networks to exploit this advantage and empirically show the improved generalization of the rule, both in- and out-of-distribution, on high-dimensional, modular tasks.",

    "title": "Independent Modular Networks",
    "published_date": "2023-06-02",
    "abstract": "Monolithic neural networks that make use of a single set of weights to learn useful representations for downstream tasks explicitly dismiss the compositional nature of data generation processes. This characteristic exists in data where every instance can be regarded as the combination of an identity concept, such as the shape of an object, combined with modifying concepts, such as orientation, color, and size. The dismissal of compositionality is especially detrimental in robotics, where state estimation relies heavily on the compositional nature of physical mechanisms (e.g., rotations and transformations) to model interactions. To accommodate this data characteristic, modular networks have been proposed. However, a lack of structure in each module's role, and modular network-specific issues such as module collapse have restricted their usability. We propose a modular network architecture that accommodates the mentioned decompositional concept by proposing a unique structure that splits the modules into predetermined roles. Additionally, we provide regularizations that improve the resiliency of the modular network to the problem of module collapse while improving the decomposition accuracy of the model."

    "title": "Verifiable and Compositional Reinforcement Learning Systems",
    "published_date": "2021-06-07",
    "abstract": "We propose a framework for verifiable and compositional reinforcement learning (RL) in which a collection of RL subsystems, each of which learns to accomplish a separate subtask, are composed to achieve an overall task. The framework consists of a high-level model, represented as a parametric Markov decision process (pMDP) which is used to plan and to analyze compositions of subsystems, and of the collection of low-level subsystems themselves. By defining interfaces between the subsystems, the framework enables automatic decompositions of task specifications, e.g., reach a target set of states with a probability of at least 0.95, into individual subtask specifications, i.e. achieve the subsystem's exit conditions with at least some minimum probability, given that its entry conditions are met. This in turn allows for the independent training and testing of the subsystems; if they each learn a policy satisfying the appropriate subtask specification, then their composition is guaranteed to satisfy the overall task specification. Conversely, if the subtask specifications cannot all be satisfied by the learned policies, we present a method, formulated as the problem of finding an optimal set of parameters in the pMDP, to automatically update the subtask specifications to account for the observed shortcomings. The result is an iterative procedure for defining subtask specifications, and for training the subsystems to meet them. As an additional benefit, this procedure allows for particularly challenging or important components of an overall task to be identified automatically, and focused on, during training. Experimental results demonstrate the presented framework's novel capabilities in both discrete and continuous RL settings. A collection of RL subsystems are trained, using proximal policy optimization algorithms, to navigate different portions of a labyrinth environment. A cross-labyrinth task specification is then decomposed into subtask specifications. Challenging portions of the labyrinth are automatically avoided if their corresponding subsystems cannot learn satisfactory policies within allowed training budgets. Unnecessary subsystems are not trained at all. The result is a compositional RL system that efficiently learns to satisfy task specifications.",

    "title": "Coordination Among Neural Modules Through a Shared Global Workspace",
    "published_date": "2021-03-01",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has seen a movement away from representing examples with a monolithic hidden state towards a richly structured state. For example, Transformers segment by position, and object-centric architectures decompose images into entities. In all these architectures, interactions between different elements are modeled via pairwise interactions: Transformers make use of self-attention to incorporate information from other positions; object-centric architectures make use of graph neural networks to model interactions among entities. However, pairwise interactions may not achieve global coordination or a coherent, integrated representation that can be used for downstream tasks. In cognitive science, a global workspace architecture has been proposed in which functionally specialized components share information through a common, bandwidth-limited communication channel. We explore the use of such a communication channel in the context of deep learning for modeling the structure of complex environments. The proposed method includes a shared workspace through which communication among different specialist modules takes place but due to limits on the communication bandwidth, specialist modules must compete for access. We show that capacity limitations have a rational basis in that (1) they encourage specialization and compositionality and (2) they facilitate the synchronization of otherwise independent specialists.",

    "title": "Provable repair of deep neural networks",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have grown in popularity over the past decade and are now being used in safety-critical domains such as aircraft collision avoidance. This has motivated a large number of techniques for finding unsafe behavior in DNNs. In contrast, this paper tackles the problem of correcting a DNN once unsafe behavior is found. We introduce the provable repair problem, which is the problem of repairing a network N to construct a new network Nâ€² that satisfies a given specification. If the safety specification is over a finite set of points, our Provable Point Repair algorithm can find a provably minimal repair satisfying the specification, regardless of the activation functions used. For safety specifications addressing convex polytopes containing infinitely many points, our Provable Polytope Repair algorithm can find a provably minimal repair satisfying the specification for DNNs using piecewise-linear activation functions. The key insight behind both of these algorithms is the introduction of a Decoupled DNN architecture, which allows us to reduce provable repair to a linear programming problem. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our Provable Repair algorithms on a variety of challenging tasks.",

    "title": "Are Neural Nets Modular? Inspecting Functional Modularity Through Differentiable Weight Masks",
    "published_date": "2020-10-05",
    "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) whose subnetworks implement reusable functions are expected to offer numerous advantages, including compositionality through efficient recombination of functional building blocks, interpretability, preventing catastrophic interference, etc. Understanding if and how NNs are modular could provide insights into how to improve them. Current inspection methods, however, fail to link modules to their functionality. In this paper, we present a novel method based on learning binary weight masks to identify individual weights and subnets responsible for specific functions. Using this powerful tool, we contribute an extensive study of emerging modularity in NNs that covers several standard architectures and datasets. We demonstrate how common NNs fail to reuse submodules and offer new insights into the related issue of systematic generalization on language tasks.",
