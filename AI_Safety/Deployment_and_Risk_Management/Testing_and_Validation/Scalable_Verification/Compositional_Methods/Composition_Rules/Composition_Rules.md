### Mini Description

Formal principles and mathematical frameworks for combining verified components while preserving their safety properties and handling emergent behaviors.

### Description

Composition Rules in AI safety verification establish the formal mathematical principles and frameworks that govern how properties of individual components can be combined to reason about system-wide behaviors. These rules define the conditions under which local guarantees can be elevated to global guarantees, addressing challenges such as non-linear interactions, emergent behaviors, and the preservation of safety properties across different types of composition (sequential, parallel, hierarchical).

A key focus is developing rigorous mathematical frameworks that can handle both deterministic and probabilistic composition, including methods for combining components with different types of guarantees or operating under different assumptions. This includes techniques for managing compositional uncertainty, dealing with approximate guarantees, and establishing bounds on error propagation when components are combined. Researchers are particularly interested in rules that can handle learned components, where traditional compositional reasoning may break down due to statistical nature of guarantees.

Current research challenges include developing composition rules that remain valid under distribution shift, managing computational complexity when reasoning about large numbers of interacting components, and establishing frameworks that can handle adaptive or evolving components. There is growing emphasis on rules that can support robust composition under uncertainty, methods for reasoning about emergent properties that arise from component interactions, and approaches for maintaining safety guarantees when components are updated or modified.
