### Mini Description

Structured approaches to human-led adversarial testing, including methodology for assembling teams, conducting exercises, and systematically documenting and analyzing findings.

### Description

Red teaming in AI safety involves organized efforts where dedicated teams systematically probe AI systems for potential vulnerabilities, failure modes, and alignment issues. These teams combine diverse expertise—including AI technical knowledge, domain expertise, and creative problem-solving—to simulate sophisticated adversaries or stress-test systems under realistic scenarios. The approach draws from military and cybersecurity traditions while adapting methodologies for the unique challenges of AI systems.

Effective red teaming requires careful consideration of team composition, testing protocols, and success metrics. Teams must balance between structured testing of known failure modes and creative exploration of novel attack vectors. A key challenge lies in developing reproducible methodologies that can be standardized across different contexts while remaining flexible enough to adapt to rapidly evolving AI capabilities. This includes establishing clear protocols for documenting findings, sharing insights across teams, and translating discoveries into actionable safety improvements.

Current research focuses on developing more sophisticated red teaming approaches for advanced AI systems, particularly those exhibiting emergent capabilities or potential for deceptive behavior. Open challenges include scaling red teaming efforts effectively, maintaining testing efficacy as AI systems become more capable, and developing methods to test for subtle failure modes that might only manifest under specific conditions. There is growing emphasis on combining human-led red teaming with automated testing approaches and developing frameworks for prioritizing which aspects of system behavior to probe.
