### Mini Description

Methods for developing realistic and informative test scenarios, including both systematic coverage of known risk categories and creative exploration of novel failure modes.

### Description

Scenario Generation in AI safety red teaming focuses on developing comprehensive and meaningful test cases that can effectively probe AI systems for potential failures, vulnerabilities, and alignment issues. This involves both systematic approaches to cover known risk categories and creative methods for discovering novel failure modes. The challenge lies in balancing between scenarios that are realistic enough to provide actionable insights while being sufficiently diverse to uncover unexpected behaviors.

A key consideration is the development of scenarios that can effectively test different aspects of system behavior, from basic functionality to complex decision-making and value alignment. This includes generating scenarios that test for specific failure modes (like reward hacking or deceptive behavior), scenarios that probe system responses to edge cases or distribution shifts, and scenarios that evaluate higher-level properties like goal structure preservation. Researchers must also consider how to generate scenarios that remain relevant and effective as AI systems become more capable.

Current research challenges include developing methods for automatically generating diverse and meaningful test scenarios, creating frameworks for evaluating scenario quality and coverage, and ensuring that generated scenarios can effectively probe for subtle failure modes that might only manifest under specific conditions. There is particular interest in approaches that can combine domain expertise with automated generation techniques to create scenarios that test both known and potential unknown failure modes.
