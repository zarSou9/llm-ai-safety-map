    "title": "Advancing Generalized Transfer Attack with Initialization Derived Bilevel Optimization and Dynamic Sequence Truncation",
    "published_date": "2024-06-04",
    "abstract": "Transfer attacks generate significant interest for real-world black-box applications by crafting transferable adversarial examples through surrogate models. Whereas, existing works essentially directly optimize the single-level objective w.r.t. the surrogate model, which always leads to poor interpretability of attack mechanism and limited generalization performance over unknown victim models. In this work, we propose the BilEvel Transfer AttacK (BETAK) framework by establishing an initialization derived bilevel optimization paradigm, which explicitly reformulates the nested constraint relationship between the Upper-Level (UL) pseudo-victim attacker and the Lower-Level (LL) surrogate attacker. Algorithmically, we introduce the Hyper Gradient Response (HGR) estimation as an effective feedback for the transferability over pseudo-victim attackers, and propose the Dynamic Sequence Truncation (DST) technique to dynamically adjust the back-propagation path for HGR and reduce computational overhead simultaneously. Meanwhile, we conduct detailed algorithmic analysis and provide convergence guarantee to support non-convexity of the LL surrogate attacker. Extensive evaluations demonstrate substantial improvement of BETAK (e.g., 53.41% increase of attack success rates against IncRes-v2_ens victim) against different victims and defense methods in targeted and untargeted attack scenarios."

    "title": "Message from the Program Committee Co-Chairs",
    "abstract": "Welcome to MASCOTS 2002 at Fort Worth in Texas. We have an exciting program presenting high quality research on computer and telecommunication systems. The focus of MASCOTS is modeling and simulation of computer and telecommunication systems. As these systems are becoming more complex and inter-related, a venue for discussing state of the art research on these domains is becoming more important. We hope that the program of MASCOTS 2002 will foster the exchange of new ideas and provide an opportunity for lively discussions among the researchers. This year experienced one of the highest number of MASCOTS submissions. We have received 180 high quality submissions from all over the world. The increased number of submissions confirms the growing importance of modeling, analysis and simulation in the performance evaluation of computer and telecommunication systems. The submitted papers were reviewed by program committee members and external referees. Each paper received at least three reviews of which at least two were from program committee members. The review process was followed by a discussion among the program committee members that led to the final selection of the papers for the conference. 57 papers were accepted for presentation at MASCOTS 2002, resulting in an acceptance rate of 31.6%. 51 papers were selected for inclusion in the proceedings as regular papers and 6 as short papers. We thank the members of the program committee who have worked really hard for putting together an excellent program. The contributions of the external referees are much appreciated. In addition to the refereed papers the technical program of the conference includes two keynote addresses from well-known experts in the field. We would like to thank Prof. Erol Gelenbe (University of Central Florida) and Dr. Connie Smith (L&S Computer Technology, Inc) for agreeing to deliver these addresses. MASCOTS 2002 also has several workshops and tutorials. They promise to be very interesting, so please don't miss them. Thanks are extended to Prof. Krishna Sivalingam and Prof. Carl Tropper who organized the tutorials, to Prof. Gabriele Kotsis and Prof. Steve Turner who organized the workshops, to Prof. Teresa Dahlberg and Prof. Peter Wilke who organized the tools sessions, as well as to Prof. Mirela S. M.A. Notare and Prof. Albert Zomaya for doing a superb job in advertising the symposium. Thanks are due to Prof. David Nicol for providing us with an improved version of WIMPE, a WWW-based tool that greatly aided the paper submission, reviewing and notification process. Last but not the least, thanks to all the authors and attendees for making this symposium a great success. We believe that MASCOTS 2002 will be an interesting and useful conference for all of you. On behalf of MASCOTS, we wish to thank Dr. W. Burggren, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, UNT, for his support and generous help. We hope that you will find this year's venue to your liking and find time to visit this pleasant city. Fort Worth is a lively city with a laid-back atmosphere exemplified by the 20-block downtown entertainment district and the historic Fort Worth Stockyards. In addition, the Fort Worth Cultural District has outstanding museums, including the famous Kimbell Art Museum. Lively entertainment is available all over the city, especially at downtown's Bass Performance Center and Sundance Square as well as at Billy Bob's in the Stockyards.",

    "title": "Controllable Fake Document Infilling for Cyber Deception",
    "published_date": "2022-10-18",
    "abstract": "Recent works in cyber deception study how to deter malicious intrusion by generating multiple fake versions of a critical document to impose costs on adversaries who need to identify the correct information. However, existing approaches are context-agnostic, resulting in sub-optimal and unvaried outputs. We propose a novel context-aware model, Fake Document Infilling (FDI), by converting the problem to a controllable mask-then-infill procedure. FDI masks important concepts of varied lengths in the document, then infills a realistic but fake alternative considering both the previous and future contexts. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on technical documents and news stories. Results show that FDI outperforms the baselines in generating highly believable fakes with moderate modification to protect critical information and deceive adversaries.",

    "title": "Data-driven Cyberattack Synthesis against Network Control Systems",
    "published_date": "2022-11-09",
    "abstract": "Network Control Systems (NCSs) pose unique vulnerabilities to cyberattacks due to a heavy reliance on communication channels. These channels can be susceptible to eavesdropping, false data injection (FDI), and denial of service (DoS). As a result, smarter cyberattacks can employ a combination of techniques to cause degradation of the considered NCS performance. We consider a white-box cyberattack synthesis technique in which the attacker initially eavesdrops to gather system data, and constructs equivalent system model. We utilize the equivalent model to synthesize hybrid cyberattacks -- a combination of FDI and DoS attacks against the NCS. Reachable sets for the equivalent NCS model provide rapid, real-time directives towards selecting NCS agents to be attacked. The devised method provides a significantly more realistic approach toward cyberattack synthesis against NCSs with unknown parameters. We demonstrate the proposed method using a multi-aerial vehicle formation control scenario.",

    "title": "A Unified Framework for Adversarial Attack and Defense in Constrained Feature Space",
    "published_date": "2021-12-02",
    "abstract": "The generation of feasible adversarial examples is necessary for properly assessing models that work in constrained feature space. However, it remains a challenging task to enforce constraints into attacks that were designed for computer vision. We propose a unified framework to generate feasible adversarial examples that satisfy given domain constraints. Our framework can handle both linear and non-linear constraints. We instantiate our framework into two algorithms: a gradient-based attack that introduces constraints in the loss function to maximize, and a multi-objective search algorithm that aims for misclassification, perturbation minimization, and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach is effective in four different domains, with a success rate of up to 100%, where state-of-the-art attacks fail to generate a single feasible example. In addition to adversarial retraining, we propose to introduce engineered non-convex constraints to improve model adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that this new defense is as effective as adversarial retraining. Our framework forms the starting point for research on constrained adversarial attacks and provides relevant baselines and datasets that future research can exploit.",

    "title": "The Hammer and the Nut: Is Bilevel Optimization Really Needed to Poison Linear Classifiers?",
    "published_date": "2021-03-23",
    "abstract": "One of the most concerning threats for modern AI systems is data poisoning, where the attacker injects maliciously crafted training data to corrupt the system's behavior at test time. Availability poisoning is a particularly worrisome subset of poisoning attacks where the attacker aims to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. However, the state-of-the-art algorithms are computationally expensive because they try to solve a complex bi-level optimization problem (the “hammer”). We observed that in particular conditions, namely, where the target model is linear (the “nut”), the usage of computationally costly procedures can be avoided. We propose a counter-intuitive but efficient heuristic that allows contaminating the training set such that the target system's performance is highly compromised. We further suggest a re-parameterization trick to decrease the number of variables to be optimized. Finally, we demonstrate that, under the considered settings, our framework achieves comparable, or even better, performances in terms of the attacker's objective while being significantly more computationally efficient.",
