### Mini Description

Techniques for constructing specific inputs or stimuli designed to trigger particular behaviors or expose vulnerabilities, including both white-box and black-box approaches.

### Description

Input Crafting focuses on the systematic construction of test inputs designed to probe specific behaviors, vulnerabilities, or failure modes in AI systems. This encompasses both the methodological frameworks for determining what kinds of inputs to create and the technical approaches for actually generating those inputs. The field draws on techniques from adversarial machine learning, program analysis, and automated testing while addressing unique challenges posed by the complexity and opacity of modern AI systems.

A central challenge is developing methods that can craft inputs targeting specific behaviors or properties while maintaining semantic validity and relevance. This includes techniques for generating perturbations that preserve key features or constraints, approaches for creating naturalistic inputs that test real-world scenarios, and methods for crafting inputs that can expose higher-level behavioral patterns or decision-making processes. Researchers must balance the trade-off between input sophistication and computational feasibility, often developing specialized techniques for different types of AI systems or testing objectives.

Current research emphasizes the development of more principled and systematic approaches to input generation, moving beyond simple perturbation-based methods toward techniques that can craft inputs testing complex behavioral properties. This includes work on semantic adversarial examples, natural language attacks, and methods for generating test cases that can probe abstract reasoning capabilities or alignment properties. Key open challenges include developing better methods for crafting inputs that test for emergent behaviors, creating approaches that can scale to more complex input spaces, and designing techniques that remain effective as AI systems become more robust to simple attacks.
