### Mini Description

Development of specific methods and techniques for constructing adversarial inputs or scenarios designed to trigger system failures or expose vulnerabilities.

### Description

Attack Vector Design in AI safety focuses on developing systematic approaches for constructing inputs, scenarios, and environmental conditions that can effectively probe AI systems for vulnerabilities and failure modes. This involves both theoretical analysis to identify potential weak points in system architectures and practical techniques for crafting specific test cases that can trigger or expose these vulnerabilities. The field draws on insights from adversarial machine learning, software testing, and security research while addressing unique challenges posed by complex AI systems.

A key challenge is developing attack vectors that can meaningfully test for higher-level safety properties beyond simple robustness failures. This includes designing scenarios to test for goal misspecification, reward hacking, deceptive behavior, and other alignment-related concerns. Researchers must also consider how to construct attack vectors that remain relevant as AI systems become more capable, potentially developing adaptive or scalable approaches that can evolve alongside advancing AI capabilities.

Current research emphasizes the development of principled approaches to attack vector design, moving beyond ad-hoc testing toward more systematic methodologies. This includes formal frameworks for characterizing different classes of attacks, techniques for generating targeted test cases based on theoretical safety concerns, and methods for evaluating the coverage and effectiveness of different attack strategies. Open challenges include developing attack vectors for testing emergent behaviors, creating approaches that can effectively probe decision-making processes in complex systems, and designing test cases that can reveal subtle failure modes in advanced AI systems.
