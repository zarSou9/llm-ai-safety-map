### Mini Description

Development and application of automated and interactive theorem proving techniques to verify properties of AI systems, including both classical logical approaches and specialized methods for ML systems.

### Description

Theorem proving in AI safety focuses on using formal logical systems and automated reasoning tools to rigorously verify properties of AI systems. This approach involves expressing both the system behavior and desired safety properties as mathematical statements, then constructing formal proofs that demonstrate these properties hold. Unlike testing-based approaches, theorem proving can provide absolute guarantees about system behavior, though these guarantees are only as strong as the underlying assumptions and specifications.

The field encompasses both interactive theorem proving, where human experts guide the proof process, and automated theorem proving, where computers search for proofs independently. Key challenges include developing tractable proof strategies for complex AI systems, handling the probabilistic nature of machine learning, and creating formal specifications that accurately capture safety requirements. Researchers work on extending traditional theorem proving techniques to handle neural networks, reinforcement learning systems, and other modern AI architectures.

Current research priorities include developing more efficient proof automation, creating specialized proof techniques for machine learning systems, and building frameworks that can handle uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning. There is particular emphasis on methods for verifying properties of deep learning systems, including techniques for proving bounds on network outputs, verifying robustness properties, and ensuring behavioral constraints. The field also explores ways to make theorem proving more accessible to AI researchers through improved tools and interfaces.
