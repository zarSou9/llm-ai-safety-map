### Description

Interactive Proof Systems in AI safety combine human insight with machine assistance to construct formal proofs about AI system properties. These systems provide structured environments where human experts can guide the high-level proof strategy while automated tools handle routine logical steps and verify each proof step's correctness. This approach leverages human intuition and creative problem-solving while maintaining mathematical rigor through machine verification.

A key challenge in interactive proof systems is managing the complexity of proofs about AI systems while keeping the interaction burden on human experts manageable. This has led to the development of sophisticated tactical languages for expressing proof strategies, interfaces that provide meaningful feedback about proof states, and libraries of reusable proof components. Researchers work to balance automation with human control, aiming to maximize the power of automated reasoning while maintaining transparency and intuition in the proof process.

Current research focuses on making interactive proof systems more accessible to AI researchers who may not be formal methods experts, developing specialized proof tactics for common patterns in AI systems, and improving the efficiency of proof construction through better automation and proof reuse. There is particular emphasis on techniques for handling the scale and complexity of modern AI systems, including methods for decomposing large proofs into manageable pieces and tools for visualizing proof progress and structure.
