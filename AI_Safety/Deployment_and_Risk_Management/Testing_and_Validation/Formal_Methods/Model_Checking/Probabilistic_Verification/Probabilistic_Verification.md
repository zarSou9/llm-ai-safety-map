### Mini Description

Approaches for verifying properties of systems with probabilistic behaviors, including methods for handling uncertainty and verifying statistical guarantees.

### Description

Probabilistic verification in AI safety focuses on developing methods to formally verify properties of systems that exhibit stochastic behavior or operate under uncertainty. This encompasses both inherent randomness in system behavior (such as in reinforcement learning policies) and uncertainty in the environment or system parameters. The field combines techniques from probability theory, statistical inference, and formal verification to provide rigorous guarantees about system behavior in probabilistic terms.

A central challenge is developing efficient methods to compute or bound probabilities of safety-critical events or behaviors. This includes techniques for verifying probabilistic reachability properties, ensuring stability in expectation, and providing probabilistic guarantees on system performance. Researchers employ various mathematical tools, including martingale theory, concentration inequalities, and probabilistic model checking algorithms, to establish these guarantees while managing computational complexity.

Current research emphasizes developing scalable verification methods for deep learning systems, particularly those operating in partially observable or uncertain environments. Key areas include techniques for verifying probabilistic neural networks, methods for handling epistemic uncertainty in learned models, and approaches for providing probabilistic certificates of safety or performance. Open challenges include developing tighter probability bounds, handling non-stationary environments, and creating compositional methods for verifying large-scale probabilistic systems.
