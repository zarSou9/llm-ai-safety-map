### Mini Description

Approximate verification techniques that use mathematical relaxations to obtain bounds on network behavior, trading some precision for computational efficiency.

### Description

Relaxation Methods in neural network verification involve techniques that approximate the exact verification problem with more tractable mathematical formulations. These approaches trade complete verification guarantees for computational efficiency by 'relaxing' the precise neural network behavior into more manageable mathematical objects, such as convex sets or intervals. This allows for faster verification of safety properties while still maintaining meaningful, though potentially conservative, bounds on network behavior.

The field encompasses various mathematical frameworks, from simple interval arithmetic to sophisticated convex relaxations and semidefinite programming approaches. Key techniques include linear programming relaxations, which approximate activation functions with linear constraints; bound propagation methods, which track the ranges of neuron activations through the network; and SDP relaxations, which reformulate verification as optimization problems over matrix variables. These methods often provide upper and lower bounds on network outputs or verification objectives, allowing for sound (though potentially incomplete) verification results.

Current research challenges include developing tighter relaxations that reduce the gap between approximate and exact verification, creating adaptive methods that can automatically choose appropriate relaxation strategies, and scaling these approaches to larger networks while maintaining meaningful bounds. There is particular interest in techniques that can provide probabilistic guarantees or confidence measures on their approximations, as well as methods that can effectively handle different types of neural network architectures and activation functions.
