### Mini Description

Methods specifically focused on handling larger networks, including decomposition approaches, parallel verification, and techniques for reducing verification complexity.

### Description

Scalability Techniques in neural network verification focus on methods and approaches for making formal verification feasible for larger, more complex neural networks. As networks grow in size and complexity, traditional verification methods often become computationally intractable due to the exponential growth in the state space that needs to be analyzed. This has driven research into specialized techniques that can maintain meaningful verification guarantees while dramatically reducing computational requirements.

Key approaches include methods for decomposing verification problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems that can be solved independently or in parallel. This includes techniques for splitting networks both vertically (layer-wise) and horizontally (neuron-wise), as well as methods for identifying and leveraging redundancy in network structures. Researchers also explore approximation techniques that can provide useful bounds with controlled trade-offs between precision and computational cost.

Current research challenges include developing more efficient pruning strategies to reduce verification complexity, creating better heuristics for problem decomposition, and designing verification algorithms that can effectively utilize modern hardware architectures. There is particular interest in techniques that can automatically adapt their verification strategy based on network structure and desired properties, as well as methods that can provide meaningful partial results when complete verification is infeasible.
