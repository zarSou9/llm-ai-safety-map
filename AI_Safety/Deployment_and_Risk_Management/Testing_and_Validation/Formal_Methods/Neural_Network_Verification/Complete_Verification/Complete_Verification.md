### Mini Description

Exact methods that provide provable guarantees about network properties, including SMT-based approaches and mixed-integer programming techniques.

### Description

Complete Verification encompasses methods that provide mathematically rigorous, exact guarantees about neural network properties through exhaustive analysis of the network's behavior space. Unlike approximate approaches, these methods can definitively prove or disprove properties of interest, such as input-output relationships, robustness bounds, or behavioral constraints. The core challenge lies in handling the non-linear nature of neural networks while maintaining computational tractability.

The field primarily employs two main technical approaches: SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). SMT-based methods translate verification problems into logical formulas and leverage sophisticated solvers to prove properties. MILP approaches reformulate neural network verification as optimization problems with integer constraints. Both approaches have seen significant advances in handling ReLU networks, though verification of other activation functions often requires specialized techniques.

Current research focuses on improving scalability through techniques like branch-and-bound algorithms, clever problem encodings, and exploitation of network structure. Key challenges include handling larger networks, developing more efficient solving strategies, and extending methods to verify more complex properties. There is particular interest in methods that can provide complete verification for specific network architectures or properties while maintaining practical computational requirements.
