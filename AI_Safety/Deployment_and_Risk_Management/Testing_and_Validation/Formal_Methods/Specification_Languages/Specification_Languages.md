### Mini Description

Development of formal languages and frameworks for precisely describing desired system properties and safety requirements in mathematically rigorous ways.

### Description

Specification Languages in AI safety focus on developing formal notations and frameworks for precisely expressing desired properties, constraints, and behaviors of AI systems. These languages bridge the gap between informal safety requirements and mathematical verification by providing rigorous ways to describe both what an AI system should do and what it should not do. This includes specifying behavioral constraints, safety properties, fairness criteria, and alignment objectives in ways that are both mathematically precise and amenable to automated verification.

A key challenge in specification language development is balancing expressiveness with tractability. Languages must be powerful enough to capture complex safety requirements, including temporal properties, probabilistic behaviors, and nested logical relationships, while remaining computationally feasible for verification tools to analyze. Researchers work to develop abstract frameworks that can handle both discrete and continuous behaviors, capture uncertainty and probability, and express both local and global properties of AI systems.

Current research focuses on developing specification languages that can handle emerging challenges in AI safety, such as expressing alignment properties, defining reward constraints, and specifying complex behavioral objectives. This includes work on probabilistic specification languages, temporal logics for deep learning systems, and frameworks for specifying human values and preferences. Open challenges include developing languages that can express emergent properties, handle distribution shift, and specify complex ethical constraints in mathematically rigorous ways.
