    "title": "Knowledge-based Reasoning and Learning under Partial Observability in Ad Hoc Teamwork",
    "published_date": "2023-06-01",
    "abstract": "\n Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) refers to the problem of enabling an agent to collaborate with teammates without prior coordination. State of the art methods in AHT are data-driven, using a large labeled dataset of prior observations to model the behavior of other agent types and to determine the ad hoc agent's behavior. These methods are computationally expensive, lack transparency, and make it difficult to adapt to previously unseen changes. Our recent work introduced an architecture that determined an ad hoc agent's behavior based on non-monotonic logical reasoning with prior commonsense domain knowledge and models learned from limited examples to predict the behavior of other agents. This paper describes KAT, a knowledge-driven architecture for AHT that substantially expands our prior architecture's capabilities to support: (a) online selection, adaptation, and learning of the behavior prediction models; and (b) collaboration with teammates in the presence of partial observability and limited communication. We illustrate and experimentally evaluate KAT's capabilities in two simulated benchmark domains for multiagent collaboration: Fort Attack and Half Field Offense. We show that KAT's performance is better than a purely knowledge-driven baseline, and comparable with or better than a state of the art data-driven baseline, particularly in the presence of limited training data, partial observability, and changes in team composition.",

    "title": "Strong-AI Autoepistemic Robots Build on Intensional First Order Logic",
    "published_date": "2022-12-14",
    "abstract": "Neuro-symbolic AI attempts to integrate neural and symbolic architectures in a manner that addresses strengths and weaknesses of each, in a complementary fashion, in order to support robust strong AI capable of reasoning, learning, and cognitive modeling. In this paper we consider the intensional First Order Logic (IFOL) as a symbolic architecture of modern robots, able to use natural languages to communicate with humans and to reason about their own knowledge with self-reference and abstraction language property. We intend to obtain the grounding of robot's language by experience of how it uses its neuronal architectures and hence by associating this experience with the mining (sense) of non-defined language concepts (particulars/individuals and universals) in PRP (Properties/Relations/Propositions) theory of IFOL.\\\\ We consider the robot's four-levels knowledge structure: The syntax level of particular natural language (Italian, French, etc..), two universal language levels: its semantic logic structure (based on virtual predicates of FOL and logic connectives), and its corresponding conceptual PRP structure level which universally represents the composite mining of FOL formulae grounded on the last robot's neuro-system level. Finally, we provide the general method how to implement in IFOL (by using the abstracted terms) different kinds of modal logic operators and their deductive axioms: we present a particular example of robots autoepistemic deduction capabilities by introduction of the special temporal $Konow$ predicate and deductive axioms for it: reflexive, positive introspection and distributive axiom.",

    "title": "Non-Axiomatic Term Logic: A Computational Theory of Cognitive Symbolic Reasoning",
    "published_date": "2022-10-12",
    "abstract": "This paper 1 presents Non-Axiomatic Term Logic (NATL) as a theoretical computational framework of humanlike symbolic reasoning in artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence. NATL unites a discrete syntactic system inspired from Aristotle's term logic and a continuous semantic system based on the modern idea of distributed representations, or embeddings. This paper positions the proposed approach in the phylogeny and the literature of logic, and explains the framework. As it is yet no more than a theory and it requires much further elaboration to implement it, no quantitative evaluation is presented. Instead, qualitative analyses of arguments using NATL, some applications to possible cognitive science/robotics-related research, and remaining issues towards a machinery implementation are discussed.",

    "title": "A General Framework for the Representation of Function and Affordance: A Cognitive, Causal, and Grounded Approach, and a Step Toward AGI",
    "published_date": "2022-06-02",
    "abstract": "The function and affordance of natural or artificial objects and various physical constructs feature prominently in the functioning of an intelligent system or an intelligent autonomous system (IAS). In navigating an environment, an IAS needs to understand the function and affordance of roads, stairs, bridges, and various physical constructs that may assist with or obstruct its movement to achieve its goal(s). When encountering objects, understanding their function and affordance so that they may be manipulated or made use of to support the IAS in performing certain required tasks is a key aspect of the intelligent functioning of the IAS. In AI research, so far, the attention paid to the characterization and representation of function and affordance has been sporadic and sparse, and it has not received the same attention as, say, object categorization or natural language processing, even though this aspect features prominently in an intelligent system's functioning, and is more fundamental and important in many ways. In the sporadic and sparse, though commendable efforts so far devoted to the characterization and understanding of function and affordance, there has also been no general framework that could unify all the different use domains and situations related to functionality, and that could provide an intelligent system or an IAS the necessary computational, representational, processing, and reasoning constructs to effect recognition, generation, and application of functional concepts. This paper develops just such a general framework, with an approach that emphasizes the fact that the representations involved must be explicitly cognitive and conceptual, and they must also contain the causal characterizations of the events and processes involved, as well as employ conceptual constructs that are grounded in the referents to which they refer, in order to achieve maximal generality for the framework to be applicable to a wide range of domains and situations. The basic general framework is described, along with a set of basic guiding principles with regards to representation of functionality. To properly and adequately characterize and represent functionality, a descriptive representation language is needed. This language is defined and developed, and many examples of its use are described. The general framework is developed based on an extension of the general language meaning representational framework called conceptual dependency. To support the general characterization and representation of functionality, the basic conceptual dependency framework is enhanced with representational devices called structure anchor and conceptual dependency elaboration, together with the definition of a set of ground level concepts. These novel representational constructs are defined, developed, and described. A general framework dealing with functionality would represent a major step toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence.",

    "published_date": "2022-05-04",
    "abstract": "We study the evaluation of ontology-mediated queries (OMQs) on\ndatabases of bounded cliquewidth from the viewpoint of parameterized\ncomplexity theory. As the ontology language, we consider the description \nlogics ALC and ALCI as well as the guarded two-variable fragment GF2\nof first-order logic. Queries are atomic queries (AQs), conjunctive\nqueries (CQs), and unions of CQs. All studied OMQ problems are\nfixed-parameter linear (FPL) when the parameter is the size of the\nOMQ plus the cliquewidth. Our main contribution is a detailed analysis of\nthe dependence of the running time on the parameter, exhibiting\nseveral interesting effects."
