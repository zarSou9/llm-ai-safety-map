### Mini Description

Design of interfaces and dashboards that enable effective human oversight, including information visualization, control mechanisms, and attention management systems.

### Description

Human-AI Interfaces focuses on designing effective interaction systems between human operators and AI systems, with particular emphasis on enabling meaningful oversight and control while managing cognitive load. This includes the development of dashboards, visualization tools, and control mechanisms that present complex AI behavior and system states in ways that humans can readily understand and act upon. The field draws on principles from human-computer interaction, cognitive psychology, and information visualization to create interfaces that support situational awareness and informed decision-making.

A key challenge is balancing information completeness with cognitive manageability. Interfaces must provide sufficient detail for operators to understand system behavior and make informed decisions, while avoiding information overload that could lead to oversight failures or delayed responses. This involves careful consideration of information hierarchies, alert systems, and interaction patterns that align with human cognitive capabilities and attention spans.

Current research focuses on developing adaptive interfaces that can adjust their presentation and control mechanisms based on context, operator expertise, and the criticality of decisions. This includes work on progressive disclosure of information, attention-directing mechanisms, and multi-modal interaction patterns. Particular emphasis is placed on ensuring interfaces remain effective as AI systems become more complex, while maintaining operator trust and preventing automation bias.
