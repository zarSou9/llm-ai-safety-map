### Mini Description

Design of information hierarchies and organization schemes that enable efficient access to relevant system information while managing complexity and cognitive load.

### Description

Information Architecture in AI safety interfaces focuses on structuring and organizing complex system information to support effective human oversight while managing cognitive constraints. This involves designing hierarchical information models that enable operators to quickly access critical data, understand system states, and maintain situational awareness across multiple operational contexts. The challenge lies in balancing completeness of information with cognitive accessibility, ensuring operators can efficiently navigate from high-level system status to detailed behavioral analysis when needed.

A key consideration is the development of adaptive information hierarchies that can adjust based on context, operator expertise, and current system state. This includes designing progressive disclosure mechanisms that reveal additional detail as needed, creating clear mental models of system behavior, and establishing consistent information patterns that align with operator expectations and decision-making processes. Research explores how to effectively layer information, from immediate operational concerns to deeper analytical insights, while maintaining clear relationships between different levels of detail.

Current research challenges include developing scalable architectures that remain effective as AI systems grow in complexity, creating dynamic information models that can adapt to emerging situations, and establishing standardized patterns for representing different types of AI behavior and state information. There is particular focus on how to structure information to support both routine monitoring and emergency response, ensuring operators can quickly access relevant information when time-critical decisions are required.
