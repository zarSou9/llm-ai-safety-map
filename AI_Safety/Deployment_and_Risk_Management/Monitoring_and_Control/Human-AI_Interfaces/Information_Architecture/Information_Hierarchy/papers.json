    "abstract": "The recent development of artificial intelligence enables a machine to achieve a human level of intelligence. Problem-solving and decision-making are two mental abilities to measure human intelligence. Many scholars have proposed different models. However, there is a gap in establishing an AI-oriented hierarchical model with a multilevel abstraction. This study proposes a novel model known as the emerged AI protocol that consists of seven distinct layers capable of providing an optimal and explainable solution for a given problem."

    "title": "A Decade of Information Architecture in HCI: A Systematic Literature Review",
    "published_date": "2022-02-27",
    "abstract": "Information Architecture (IA) is a blueprint for the information system in websites or other information-rich environments. It corresponds to how we organize, label and structure information. The importance of Information Architecture and its influence on a system's usability is vastly discussed in literature. Because of the inherent connection between Information Architecture concepts and the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) field, we decided to investigate how previous research has used Information Architecture in the context of Human Computer Interaction (IAinHCI). In order to do that, we followed a two phase process. First, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). We queried both the ACM and IEEE databases. We filtered and assessed 311 papers that spanned a decade of research on Information Architecture. We found 25 papers that utilized Information Architecture in the context of Human Computer Interaction. Then, we followed a Background Reference Search process using the SLR resulting papers as a starting set. We assessed the eligibility of the reference list of all 25 papers and found eight additional papers that were relevant to our research question. Results of our review show that, IAinHCI papers fall under seven main categories, from IoT to the semantic web and ubiquitous technology. The website category, however, was both the most consistent over the years and the most prevalent category accounting for 67% of the papers. Our findings suggest that IA has not yet uncovered its full potential and there is still room for research to leverage and expend the IA knowledge base promising a prosperous future for Information Architecture.",

    "title": "An Information-oriented Model of Multi-Scale (Feedback) Systems",
    "published_date": "2021-06-03",
    "abstract": "Multi-scale structures are prevalent in both natural and artificial systems, as they can handle increasing complexity. Several terms are employed almost interchangeably across various application domains to refer to the multi-scale concept - e.g., hierarchy, holarchy, multi-level, multi-layer, nested, embedded, micro-macro or coarse graining. While the concrete meanings behind these terms may differ slightly, several core commonalities persist across all cases. In this position paper we aim to highlight these common features of the multi-scale concept, as a preliminary basis for a generic theory of multi-scale systems. We discuss the concepts of scale and multi-scale systems in general, and then of multi-scale feedback systems in particular, focusing on the role played by information in such systems. Our long-term objective is to develop a general theory of multi-scale feedback systems, applicable across all domains dealing with complex systems."

    "title": "Label Hierarchy Transition: Delving into Class Hierarchies to Enhance Deep Classifiers",
    "published_date": "2021-12-04",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical classification aims to sort the object into a hierarchical structure of categories. For example, a bird can be categorized according to a three-level hierarchy of order, family, and species. Existing methods commonly address hierarchical classification by decoupling it into a series of multi-class classification tasks. However, such a multi-task learning strategy fails to fully exploit the correlation among various categories across different levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we propose Label Hierarchy Transition (LHT), a unified probabilistic framework based on deep learning, to address the challenges of hierarchical classification. The LHT framework consists of a transition network and a confusion loss. The transition network focuses on explicitly learning the label hierarchy transition matrices, which has the potential to effectively encode the underlying correlations embedded within class hierarchies. The confusion loss encourages the classification network to learn correlations across different label hierarchies during training. The proposed framework can be readily adapted to any existing deep network with only minor modifications. We experiment with a series of public benchmark datasets for hierarchical classification problems, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach beyond current state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we extend our proposed LHT framework to the skin lesion diagnosis task and validate its great potential in computer-aided diagnosis. The code of our method is available at \\href{https://github.com/renzhenwang/label-hierarchy-transition}{https://github.com/renzhenwang/label-hierarchy-transition}.",

    "title": "New Approaches for NLU based on Information Architecture",
    "published_date": "2020-10-24",
    "abstract": "First of all, please forget all you knew about the lexical classification, then let's jump to the conclusion. This paper reclassified lexical chunks into data chunks, structure chunks, and pointer chunks. Almost all data chunks are information sets. According to the difference of the set structures, data chunks can be further divided into attribute chunks and entity chunks. According to the different abstraction level and method, attribute chunks can be further divided into basic attribute chunks, extended attribute chunks, and advanced attribute chunks. All of the above classification principles are structural and functionalbased discrimination, instead of artificially divide lexical chunks into a noun, adjective, pronouns, and so on. Now, let's back to the normal study process. The author believes natural language is one of the ways information is encoded and it has highly abstracted and conceptualized the information. Therefore the study begins with disassembling the information represented by natural language and then discovered the classification coding system of attribute information, and the abstraction relations between attribute information and entities in the real world. To have a clear and better discussion, the author constructed corresponding data storage models, and extract three kinds of data reading modes on those data storage models, they are the defining reading mode which is driven by the structural word: be, the set reading mode which is driven by the structural word: have, and the process reading mode which is driven by verbs. Sentences output by the above data reading modes can be further divided into the data description task, the data verification task, and the data search task, according to task types represented by these sentences ..."

    "title": "Web Application for Collaborative Semantic Web Information Architecture",
    "published_date": "2018-10-18",
    "abstract": "In this paper is analyzed the prototyping of the information visualization on a Web Application for community purposes in a collaborative environment representing an evolution of the actual social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin, VirgilioPeople,... The intent of this work is to identify the most common features of Web App for the information visualization based on the Semantic Web and discuss how they support the user's requirements in a \"collaborative\" environment. A solution for the context-aware development of UI is based on \"joint meaning\" understood as a joint construal of the creator of the community contents and the user of the community contents thanks to the context and interface adaptation using the faced taxonomy with the Semantic Web. A proof-of concept prototype allows showing that the proposed methodological approach can also easily be applied to existing presentation components, built with different languages and/or component technologies.",
