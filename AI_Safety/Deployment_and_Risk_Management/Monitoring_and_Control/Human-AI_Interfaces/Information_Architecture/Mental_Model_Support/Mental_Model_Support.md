### Mini Description

Structures and patterns that help operators build and maintain accurate mental models of AI system behavior and state, including consistent information organization and relationship mapping.

### Description

Mental Model Support focuses on designing information structures and representations that help operators develop and maintain accurate cognitive frameworks for understanding AI system behavior, capabilities, and limitations. This involves creating consistent patterns and relationships in how information is presented, enabling operators to build robust mental models that support both routine operations and novel situation handling. The challenge lies in bridging the gap between complex AI systems' actual operation and human operators' ability to conceptualize and reason about these systems.

A key consideration is how to support different levels of mental model development, from novice operators building initial understanding to experts requiring deeper insights into system behavior. This includes providing clear cause-and-effect relationships, making system uncertainties explicit, and helping operators understand the boundaries of AI capabilities. Research explores how to represent abstract concepts like confidence levels, decision boundaries, and potential failure modes in ways that align with human intuitive reasoning.

Current research challenges include developing representations that scale with increasing AI complexity, supporting accurate calibration of operator trust through transparent capability communication, and maintaining consistent mental models across different operational contexts. Particular attention is given to helping operators understand emergent behaviors, recognize potential failure modes, and maintain appropriate situation awareness without requiring deep technical knowledge of the underlying AI systems.
