### Mini Description

Methods and interfaces for effectively conveying system confidence levels and limitations to operators, including visualization of uncertainty and risk factors.

### Description

Uncertainty Communication focuses on developing effective methods for conveying the confidence levels, limitations, and potential risks associated with AI system outputs to human operators. This encompasses both the technical challenges of quantifying different types of uncertainty (such as model uncertainty, data uncertainty, and distributional uncertainty) and the interface design challenges of presenting this information in ways that support rapid comprehension and decision-making.

A key consideration is balancing the granularity of uncertainty information against cognitive processing constraints. While detailed uncertainty metrics may be available, presenting too much detail can overwhelm operators and impede effective decision-making. Research explores various visualization techniques, including probability distributions, confidence intervals, and qualitative indicators, as well as methods for progressive disclosure of uncertainty information based on context and criticality.

Current research challenges include developing standardized approaches for communicating different types of uncertainty, understanding how various visualization methods affect operator decision-making, and creating adaptive systems that can adjust uncertainty communication based on operator expertise and task requirements. Particular attention is being given to handling compound uncertainties, communicating uncertainty in time-critical situations, and developing intuitive representations for complex uncertainty scenarios.
