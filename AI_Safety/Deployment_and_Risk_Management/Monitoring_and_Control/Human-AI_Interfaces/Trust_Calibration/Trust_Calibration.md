### Mini Description

Interface design approaches that help operators maintain appropriate levels of trust in AI systems, avoiding both over-reliance and excessive skepticism.

### Description

Trust Calibration in human-AI interfaces focuses on designing interaction patterns and feedback mechanisms that help operators develop and maintain appropriate levels of trust in AI systems. This involves addressing both overtrust, where operators may rely too heavily on AI systems and fail to maintain adequate oversight, and undertrust, where excessive skepticism prevents effective human-AI collaboration. The challenge lies in creating interfaces that accurately convey system capabilities, limitations, and confidence levels while accounting for human cognitive biases and the dynamic nature of trust formation.

A key consideration is the development of transparency mechanisms that provide operators with meaningful insight into system decision-making processes and reliability. This includes methods for communicating uncertainty, explaining system rationale, and providing performance history in ways that support accurate trust assessment. Research shows that trust calibration is heavily influenced by early interactions and critical incidents, making it essential to design interfaces that promote appropriate trust formation from the outset.

Current research challenges include developing adaptive trust calibration mechanisms that account for varying operator expertise and system capabilities, measuring and modeling trust dynamics over time, and creating interfaces that maintain appropriate trust levels as AI systems evolve. Particular attention is being given to understanding how different forms of explanation and performance feedback influence trust formation, and how to design interfaces that promote resilient trust that can withstand occasional system failures while remaining appropriately calibrated.
