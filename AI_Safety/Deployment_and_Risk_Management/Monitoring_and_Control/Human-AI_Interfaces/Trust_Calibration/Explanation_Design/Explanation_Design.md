### Mini Description

Approaches for providing appropriate levels of system explanation and rationale that support trust formation without overwhelming operators.

### Description

Explanation Design focuses on developing methods and principles for AI systems to communicate their reasoning, decisions, and internal states to human operators in ways that support appropriate trust formation and effective oversight. This involves determining what information should be explained, how to structure and present explanations, and how to adapt explanations based on operator needs, expertise, and context. The field draws on research in cognitive psychology, education, and human-computer interaction to create explanation systems that balance comprehensiveness with cognitive accessibility.

A central challenge is managing the inherent tension between completeness and comprehensibility. While detailed technical explanations might provide the most accurate picture of system behavior, they often prove overwhelming or incomprehensible to operators. Conversely, oversimplified explanations risk missing crucial details or creating misleading mental models. Research explores various approaches to this trade-off, including progressive disclosure mechanisms, multi-level explanations, and adaptive systems that adjust explanation complexity based on operator expertise and needs.

Current research emphasizes developing explanation frameworks that remain effective as AI systems become more complex and less inherently interpretable. This includes work on counterfactual explanations, feature attribution methods, and approaches for explaining decision boundaries and uncertainty. Particular attention is being given to understanding how different types of explanations influence operator mental models and decision-making, as well as developing methods to validate the accuracy and usefulness of generated explanations.
