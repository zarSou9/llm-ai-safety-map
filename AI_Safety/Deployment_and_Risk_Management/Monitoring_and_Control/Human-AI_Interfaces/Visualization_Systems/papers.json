    "title": "Visualization for Human-Centered AI Tools",
    "published_date": "2024-04-02",
    "abstract": "Human-centered AI (HCAI) puts the user in the driver's seat of so-called human-centered AI-infused tools (HCAI tools): interactive software tools that amplify, augment, empower, and enhance human performance using AI models. We discuss how interactive visualization can be a key enabling technology for creating such human-centered AI tools. To validate our approach, we first interviewed HCI, AI, and Visualization experts to define the characteristics of HCAI tools. We then present several examples of HCAI tools using visualization and use the examples to extract guidelines on how interactive visualization can support future HCAI tools.",

    "title": "DVRP-MHSI: Dynamic Visualization Research Platform for Multimodal Human-Swarm Interaction",
    "published_date": "2024-08-20",
    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a significant amount of research on algorithms and control methods for distributed collaborative robots. However, the emergence of collective behavior in a swarm is still difficult to predict and control. Nevertheless, human interaction with the swarm helps render the swarm more predictable and controllable, as human operators can utilize intuition or knowledge that is not always available to the swarm. Therefore, this paper designs the Dynamic Visualization Research Platform for Multimodal Human-Swarm Interaction (DVRP-MHSI), which is an innovative open system that can perform real-time dynamic visualization and is specifically designed to accommodate a multitude of interaction modalities (such as brain-computer, eye-tracking, electromyographic, and touch-based interfaces), thereby expediting progress in human-swarm interaction research. Specifically, the platform consists of custom-made low-cost omnidirectional wheeled mobile robots, multitouch screens and two workstations. In particular, the mutitouch screens can recognize human gestures and the shapes of objects placed on them, and they can also dynamically render diverse scenes. One of the workstations processes communication information within robots and the other one implements human-robot interaction methods. The development of DVRP-MHSI frees researchers from hardware or software details and allows them to focus on versatile swarm algorithms and human-swarm interaction methods without being limited to fixed scenarios, tasks, and interfaces. The effectiveness and potential of the platform for human-swarm interaction studies are validated by several demonstrative experiments.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "DVRP-MHSI is an open, real-time dynamic visualization platform designed for researching multimodal human-swarm interaction, enabling researchers to easily test various swarm algorithms and human interaction methods using diverse interfaces (brain-computer, eye-tracking, EMG, touch). Its modular design and low-cost hardware facilitate experimentation and accelerates progress in the field."

    "title": "Dynamic User Interface Generation for Enhanced Human-Computer Interaction Using Variational Autoencoders",
    "published_date": "2024-12-19",
    "abstract": "This study presents a novel approach for intelligent user interaction interface generation and optimization, grounded in the variational autoencoder (VAE) model. With the rapid advancement of intelligent technologies, traditional interface design methods struggle to meet the evolving demands for diversity and personalization, often lacking flexibility in real-time adjustments to enhance the user experience. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) plays a critical role in addressing these challenges by focusing on creating interfaces that are functional, intuitive, and responsive to user needs. This research leverages the RICO dataset to train the VAE model, enabling the simulation and creation of user interfaces that align with user aesthetics and interaction habits. By integrating real-time user behavior data, the system dynamically refines and optimizes the interface, improving usability and underscoring the importance of HCI in achieving a seamless user experience. Experimental findings indicate that the VAE-based approach significantly enhances the quality and precision of interface generation compared to other methods, including autoencoders (AE), generative adversarial networks (GAN), conditional GANs (cGAN), deep belief networks (DBN), and VAE-GAN. This work contributes valuable insights into HCI, providing robust technical solutions for automated interface generation and enhanced user experience optimization.",
    "summary": "This research uses variational autoencoders (VAEs) to dynamically generate and optimize user interfaces based on user behavior data from the RICO dataset, outperforming other generative models in creating personalized and responsive interfaces. The system enhances human-computer interaction by adapting the interface in real-time to improve usability and user experience."

    "title": "ScriptViz: A Visualization Tool to Aid Scriptwriting based on a Large Movie Database",
    "published_date": "2024-10-04",
    "abstract": "Scriptwriters usually rely on their mental visualization to create a vivid story by using their imagination to see, feel, and experience the scenes they are writing. Besides mental visualization, they often refer to existing images or scenes in movies and analyze the visual elements to create a certain mood or atmosphere. In this paper, we develop ScriptViz to provide external visualization based on a large movie database for the screenwriting process. It retrieves reference visuals on the fly based on scripts' text and dialogue from a large movie database. The tool provides two types of control on visual elements that enable writers to 1) see exactly what they want with fixed visual elements and 2) see variances in uncertain elements. User evaluation among 15 scriptwriters shows that ScriptViz is able to present scriptwriters with consistent yet diverse visual possibilities, aligning closely with their scripts and helping their creation.",
    "summary": "ScriptViz is a visualization tool that assists scriptwriters by retrieving relevant visual references from a large movie database based on script text and dialogue, offering both fixed and variable visual options to aid creative visualization. User studies indicate its effectiveness in providing consistent yet diverse visual possibilities to support the screenwriting process."

    "published_date": "2023-06-27",
    "abstract": "This study provides a comprehensive review of the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) for visualizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, drawing on 18 selected studies. The results illuminate a complex interplay of tools, methods, and approaches, notably the prominence of VR engines like Unreal Engine and Unity. However, despite these tools, a universal solution for effective AI visualization remains elusive, reflecting the unique strengths and limitations of each technique. We observed the application of VR for AI visualization across multiple domains, despite challenges such as high data complexity and cognitive load. Moreover, it briefly discusses the emerging ethical considerations pertaining to the broad integration of these technologies. Despite these challenges, the field shows significant potential, emphasizing the need for dedicated research efforts to unlock the full potential of these immersive technologies. This review, therefore, outlines a roadmap for future research, encouraging innovation in visualization techniques, addressing identified challenges, and considering the ethical implications of VR and AI convergence.",
