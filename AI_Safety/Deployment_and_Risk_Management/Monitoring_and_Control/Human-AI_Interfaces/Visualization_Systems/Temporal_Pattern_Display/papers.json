    "title": "Feature-Action Design Patterns for Storytelling Visualizations with Time Series Data",
    "published_date": "2024-02-05",
    "abstract": "We present a method to create storytelling visualization with time series data. Many personal decisions nowadays rely on access to dynamic data regularly, as we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is thus desirable to construct storytelling visualization for dynamic data that is selected by an individual for a specific context. Because of the need to tell data-dependent stories, predefined storyboards based on known data cannot accommodate dynamic data easily nor scale up to many different individuals and contexts. Motivated initially by the need to communicate time series data during the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a novel computer-assisted method for meta-authoring of stories, which enables the design of storyboards that include feature-action patterns in anticipation of potential features that may appear in dynamically arrived or selected data. In addition to meta-storyboards involving COVID-19 data, we also present storyboards for telling stories about progress in a machine learning workflow. Our approach is complementary to traditional methods for authoring storytelling visualization, and provides an efficient means to construct data-dependent storyboards for different data-streams of similar contexts."

    "title": "RTVis: Research Trend Visualization Toolkit",
    "published_date": "2023-07-19",
    "abstract": "When researchers are about to start a new project or have just entered a new research field, choosing a proper research topic is always challenging. To help them have an overall understanding of the research trend in real-time and find out the research topic they are interested in, we developed the Research Trend Visualization toolkit (RTVis) to analyze and visualize the research paper information. RTVis consists of a field theme river, a co-occurrence network, a specialized citation bar chart, and a word frequency race diagram, showing the field change through time, cooperating relationship among authors, paper citation numbers in different venues, and the most common words in the abstract part respectively. Moreover, RTVis is open source and easy to deploy. The demo of our toolkit and code with detailed documentation are both available online."

    "title": "Reclaiming the Horizon: Novel Visualization Designs for Time-Series Data with Large Value Ranges",
    "published_date": "2023-07-18",
    "abstract": "We introduce two novel visualization designs to support practitioners in performing identification and discrimination tasks on large value ranges (i.e., several orders of magnitude) in time-series data: (1) The <italic>order of magnitude horizon</italic> graph, which extends the classic horizon graph; and (2) the <italic>order of magnitude line</italic> chart, which adapts the log-line chart. These new visualization designs visualize large value ranges by explicitly splitting the mantissa <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"tvcg-braun-3326576-eqinline-1-small.tif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and exponent <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$e$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"tvcg-braun-3326576-eqinline-2-small.tif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> of a value <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$v=m\\cdot 10^{e}$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"tvcg-braun-3326576-eqinline-3-small.tif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. We evaluate our novel designs against the most relevant state-of-the-art visualizations in an empirical user study. It focuses on four main tasks commonly employed in the analysis of time-series and large value ranges visualization: identification, discrimination, estimation, and trend detection. For each task we analyze error, confidence, and response time. The new <italic>order of magnitude horizon</italic> graph performs better or equal to all other designs in identification, discrimination, and estimation tasks. Only for trend detection tasks, the more traditional horizon graphs reported better performance. Our results are domain-independent, only requiring time-series data with large value ranges.",

    "title": "ZigzagNetVis: Suggesting temporal resolutions for graph visualization using zigzag persistence",
    "published_date": "2023-04-07",
    "abstract": "Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent complex systems and track the evolution of their constituents over time. Visualizing these graphs is crucial as it allows one to quickly identify anomalies, trends, patterns, and other properties that facilitate better decision-making. In this context, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is essential for constructing and visually analyzing the layout. The choice of resolution is particularly important, especially when dealing with temporally sparse graphs. In such cases, changing the temporal resolution by grouping events (i.e., edges) from consecutive timestamps -- a technique known as timeslicing -- can aid in the analysis and reveal patterns that might not be discernible otherwise. However, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose ZigzagNetVis, a methodology that suggests temporal resolutions potentially relevant for analyzing a given graph, i.e., resolutions that lead to substantial topological changes in the graph structure. ZigzagNetVis achieves this by leveraging zigzag persistent homology, a well-established technique from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). To improve visual graph analysis, ZigzagNetVis incorporates the colored barcode, a novel timeline-based visualization inspired by persistence barcodes commonly used in TDA. We also contribute with a web-based system prototype that implements suggestion methodology and visualization tools. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of ZigzagNetVis through a usage scenario, a user study with 27 participants, and a detailed quantitative evaluation."

    "title": "Electrical Appliance Usage Timeline Data Visualization: Machinima and Dynamic Circle",
    "abstract": "In a storytelling context, the visualization of the timelines for appliance usage could convey a great amount of information to audiences about the patterns or habits of households when using appliances in smart home. However, today's research on smart home visualization is more focused on time series data, while research on timeline does not focus much on expressiveness in a storytelling context. If we simply visualize the time series or use traditional visualization methods to visualize the timeline, the intention and effectiveness of storytelling may be reduced. In this paper, we analyze the above issues in detail and propose a new visualization design based on machinima and a dynamic circle.",

    "title": "ExpanDrogram: Dynamic Visualization of Big Data Segmentation over Time",
    "abstract": "In dynamic and big data environments the visualization of a segmentation process over time often does not enable the user to simultaneously track entire pieces. The key points are sometimes incomparable, and the user is limited to a static visual presentation of a certain point. The proposed visualization concept, called ExpanDrogram, is designed to support dynamic classifiers that run in a big data environment subject to changes in data characteristics. It offers a wide range of features that seek to maximize the customization of a segmentation problem. The main goal of the ExpanDrogram visualization is to improve comprehensiveness by combining both the individual and segment levels, illustrating the dynamics of the segmentation process over time, providing “version control” that enables the user to observe the history of changes, and more. The method is illustrated using different datasets, with which we demonstrate multiple segmentation parameters, as well as multiple display layers, to highlight points such as new trend detection, outlier detection, tracking changes in original segments, and zoom in/out for more/less detail. The datasets vary in size from a small one to one of more than 12 million records.",
