    "title": "Towards Meaningfully Integrating Human-Autonomy Teaming in Applied Settings",
    "abstract": "Technological advancement goes hand in hand with economic advancement, meaning applied industries like manufacturing, medicine, and retail are set to leverage new practices like human-autonomy teams. These human-autonomy teams call for deep integration between artificial intelligence and the human workers that make up a majority of the workforce. This paper identifies the core principles of the human-autonomy teaming literature relevant to the integration of human-autonomy teams in applied contexts and research due to this large scale implementation of human-autonomy teams. A framework is built and defined from these fundamental concepts, with specific examples of its use in applied contexts and the interactions between various components of the framework. This framework can be utilized by practitioners of human-autonomy teams, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding the integration and training of human-autonomy teams.",
