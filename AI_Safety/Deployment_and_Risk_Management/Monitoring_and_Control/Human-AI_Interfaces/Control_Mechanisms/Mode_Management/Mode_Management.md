### Mini Description

Systems for controlling and transitioning between different operational modes or levels of automation, including mechanisms for smooth handoffs between human and AI control.

### Description

Mode Management in AI control systems focuses on the design and implementation of mechanisms for handling transitions between different operational states and levels of automation. This includes managing shifts between fully autonomous operation, various forms of human-AI collaboration, and direct human control. The core challenge lies in ensuring these transitions are smooth, predictable, and maintain system safety while avoiding confusion or loss of situation awareness.

A critical aspect is the clear definition and communication of available modes, their capabilities, and limitations. Research explores how to design mode hierarchies that are intuitive yet comprehensive, covering both planned transitions (like shift changes or routine maintenance) and unplanned ones (such as emergency takeovers or system degradation). This includes developing protocols for mode activation, validation of mode changes, and confirmation of successful transitions.

Current research challenges include preventing mode confusion through clear status indication, managing partial mode transitions, and handling edge cases where multiple modes might conflict. Particular attention is given to developing frameworks that can gracefully handle mode transitions in time-critical situations, ensuring that neither human operators nor AI systems lose track of their current responsibilities and authorities. This includes work on predictive mode suggestion, where systems anticipate and prepare for likely mode transitions before they become necessary.
