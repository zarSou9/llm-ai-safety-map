### Mini Description

Systems and protocols for ongoing surveillance of AI behavior, including performance metrics, anomaly detection, and mechanisms for human oversight and intervention.

### Description

Monitoring and Control focuses on maintaining ongoing awareness and influence over AI system behavior during deployment. This encompasses the development of metrics and measurement systems to track performance, detect anomalies or drift, and ensure continued alignment with intended objectives. Key challenges include designing monitoring systems that can effectively track complex AI behaviors, developing meaningful metrics that correlate with system safety and performance, and creating interfaces that enable appropriate human oversight without overwhelming operators.

A central consideration is the balance between automation and human control. Research explores various control architectures, from fully autonomous operation with human monitoring to hybrid approaches where human operators maintain different levels of control over system decisions. This includes developing clear indicators of system state, mechanisms for graceful transfer of control between AI and human operators, and interfaces that support informed decision-making while preventing information overload.

Current research emphasizes the development of interpretable monitoring systems that can handle the complexity of modern AI while remaining actionable for human operators. This includes work on real-time visualization of system behavior, predictive analytics to anticipate potential issues before they occur, and the development of monitoring systems that remain effective as AI capabilities scale. Particular attention is given to detecting subtle forms of misalignment or performance degradation that might otherwise go unnoticed until they become serious problems.
