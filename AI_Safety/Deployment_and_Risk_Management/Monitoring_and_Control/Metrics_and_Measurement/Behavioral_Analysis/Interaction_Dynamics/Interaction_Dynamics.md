### Mini Description

Examination of how systems behave in interactive scenarios, including human-AI interaction patterns and multi-agent dynamics.

### Description

Interaction Dynamics focuses on understanding and analyzing the complex patterns of behavior that emerge when AI systems engage with other agents, whether human or artificial. This includes studying how AI systems adapt their behavior based on interaction partners, how they interpret and respond to feedback, and how their decision-making processes are influenced by the dynamic nature of interactive scenarios. Key challenges include modeling the reciprocal nature of interactions, accounting for strategic adaptation, and ensuring stable and beneficial interaction patterns.

A central consideration is the development of frameworks to analyze different types of interactions, from simple request-response patterns to complex multi-turn dialogues and strategic games. This includes studying how AI systems develop and maintain models of their interaction partners, how they handle uncertainty and ambiguity in communication, and how they balance multiple competing objectives during interaction. Researchers particularly focus on identifying and preventing problematic interaction patterns such as manipulation, deception, or unproductive cycling behaviors.

Current research emphasizes understanding how interaction patterns scale with system capabilities and complexity. This includes developing methods to analyze emergent social behaviors, studying the formation and evolution of interaction protocols, and investigating how different architectural choices affect interaction dynamics. Particular attention is given to ensuring that interactions remain safe, productive, and aligned with human values as systems become more sophisticated in their ability to model and respond to other agents.
