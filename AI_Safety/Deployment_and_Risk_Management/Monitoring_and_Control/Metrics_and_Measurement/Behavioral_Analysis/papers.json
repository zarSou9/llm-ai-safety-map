    "title": "Retail store customer behavior analysis system: Design and Implementation",
    "published_date": "2023-09-05",
    "abstract": "Understanding customer behavior in retail stores plays a crucial role in improving customer satisfaction by adding personalized value to services. Behavior analysis reveals both general and detailed patterns in the interaction of customers with a store items and other people, providing store managers with insight into customer preferences. Several solutions aim to utilize this data by recognizing specific behaviors through statistical visualization. However, current approaches are limited to the analysis of small customer behavior sets, utilizing conventional methods to detect behaviors. They do not use deep learning techniques such as deep neural networks, which are powerful methods in the field of computer vision. Furthermore, these methods provide limited figures when visualizing the behavioral data acquired by the system. In this study, we propose a framework that includes three primary parts: mathematical modeling of customer behaviors, behavior analysis using an efficient deep learning based system, and individual and group behavior visualization. Each module and the entire system were validated using data from actual situations in a retail store.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a retail customer behavior analysis system using deep learning to analyze large datasets of customer interactions, offering improved visualization compared to conventional methods. The system's framework includes mathematical modeling, deep learning-based behavior analysis, and detailed visualization of individual and group behaviors, all validated with real-world retail data."

    "title": "Adaptive Performance Anomaly Detection for Online Service Systems via Pattern Sketching",
    "published_date": "2022-01-09",
    "abstract": "To ensure the performance of online service systems, their status is closely monitored with various software and system metrics. Performance anomalies represent the performance degradation issues (e.g., slow response) of the service systems. When performing anomaly detection over the metrics, existing methods often lack the merit of interpretability, which is vital for engineers and analysts to take remediation actions. Moreover, they are unable to effectively accommodate the ever-changing services in an online fashion. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose ADSketch, an interpretable and adaptive performance anomaly detection approach based on pattern sketching. ADSketch achieves interpretability by identifying groups of anomalous metric patterns, which represent particular types of performance issues. The underlying issues can then be immediately recognized if similar patterns emerge again. In addition, an adaptive learning algorithm is designed to embrace unprecedented patterns induced by service updates or user behavior changes. The proposed approach is evaluated with public data as well as industrial data collected from a representative online service system in Huawei Cloud. The experimental results show that ADSketch outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the online algorithm in new pattern discovery. Furthermore, our approach has been successfully deployed in industrial practice.",

    "published_date": "2022-02-14",
    "summary": "The article highlights common statistical errors, particularly the flawed assumption of Gaussian distributions in many fields and misinterpretations of p-values. These errors, along with neglecting statistical power and the base rate fallacy, contribute to unreliable conclusions in scientific studies and data-driven decision-making."

    "title": "An Information-oriented Model of Multi-Scale (Feedback) Systems",
    "published_date": "2021-06-03",
    "abstract": "Multi-scale structures are prevalent in both natural and artificial systems, as they can handle increasing complexity. Several terms are employed almost interchangeably across various application domains to refer to the multi-scale concept - e.g., hierarchy, holarchy, multi-level, multi-layer, nested, embedded, micro-macro or coarse graining. While the concrete meanings behind these terms may differ slightly, several core commonalities persist across all cases. In this position paper we aim to highlight these common features of the multi-scale concept, as a preliminary basis for a generic theory of multi-scale systems. We discuss the concepts of scale and multi-scale systems in general, and then of multi-scale feedback systems in particular, focusing on the role played by information in such systems. Our long-term objective is to develop a general theory of multi-scale feedback systems, applicable across all domains dealing with complex systems.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes an information-centric framework for understanding multi-scale (feedback) systems, aiming to unify diverse terminologies and develop a general theory applicable across various complex systems. The authors focus on identifying common features of multi-scale concepts to build this foundational theory."

    "title": "Adding semantics to measurements: Ontology-guided, systematic performance analysis",
    "published_date": "2021-12-21",
    "abstract": "The design and operation of modern software systems exhibit a shift towards virtualization, containerization and service-based orchestration. Performance capacity engineering and resource utilization tuning become priority requirements in such environments. Measurement-based performance evaluation is the cornerstone of capacity engineering and designing for performance. Moreover, the increasing complexity of systems necessitates rigorous performance analysis approaches. However, empirical performance analysis lacks sophisticated model-based support similar to the functional design of the system. The paper proposes an ontology-based approach for facilitating and guiding the empirical evaluation throughout its various steps. Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), an open-source blockchain platform by the Linux Foundation, is modelled and evaluated as a pilot example of the approach, using the standard TPC-C performance benchmark workload.",

    "title": "Measuring and improving information systems agility through the balanced scorecard approach",
    "published_date": "2021-09-13",
    "abstract": "Facing an environment increasingly complex, uncertain and changing, even in crisis, organizations are driven to be agile in order to survive. Agility, at the core heart of business strategy, represents the ability to grow in a competitive environment of continuous and unpredictable changes with information systems perceived as one of its main enablers. In other words, to be agile, organizations must be able to rely on agile enterprise information systems/information technology (IT/IS). Since, the agility needs are not the same among stakeholders, the objective of this research is to develop a conceptual model for the achievement and assessment of IT/IS agility from balanced perspectives to support agile organizations. Several researches have indicated that the IT balanced scorecard (BSC) approach is an appropriate technique for evaluating IT performance. This paper provides a balanced-scorecard based framework to evaluate the IS agility through four perspectives: business contribution, user orientation, operation excellence and innovation and competitiveness. The proposed framework, called IS Agility BSC, propose a three layer structure for each of the four perspectives: mission, key success factors, and agility evaluation criteria. According to this conceptual model, enterprise information systems agility is measured according to 14 agility key success factors, over the four BSC perspectives, using 42 agility evaluation criteria that are identified based on literature survey methodology. This paper explores agility in the broader context of the enterprise information systems. The findings will provide, for both researchers and practitioners, a practical approach for achieving and measuring IS agility performance to support organizations in attempt to become agile as a new condition of surviving in the new business world.",
