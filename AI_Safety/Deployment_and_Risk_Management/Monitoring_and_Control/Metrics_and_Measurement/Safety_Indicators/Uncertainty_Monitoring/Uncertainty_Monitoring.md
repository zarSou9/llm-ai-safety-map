### Mini Description

Methods and metrics for tracking system uncertainty and confidence levels, including epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation, calibration monitoring, and confidence thresholding.

### Description

Uncertainty Monitoring in AI safety focuses on developing and implementing methods to quantify, track, and respond to various forms of uncertainty in AI system outputs and behaviors. This encompasses both epistemic uncertainty (arising from limited knowledge or data) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness in the system), as well as techniques for combining and interpreting different uncertainty signals. The field emphasizes the importance of reliable uncertainty estimation as a crucial safety mechanism, enabling systems to recognize when they might be operating outside their zone of competence.

A central challenge is developing uncertainty estimation methods that remain calibrated and reliable across different operational contexts and types of inputs. This includes work on Bayesian neural networks, ensemble methods, and direct uncertainty modeling approaches. Researchers also focus on creating computationally efficient methods that can provide real-time uncertainty estimates without significantly impacting system performance, while ensuring these estimates remain meaningful and actionable for human operators.

Current research explores methods for detecting and handling unknown unknowns, developing uncertainty awareness in deep learning systems, and creating robust calibration techniques that remain reliable under distribution shift. Particular attention is given to the challenge of uncertainty estimation in large language models and other complex AI systems where traditional statistical approaches may be insufficient. This includes work on interactive uncertainty elicitation, meta-uncertainty estimation, and methods for combining multiple uncertainty signals into coherent risk assessments.
