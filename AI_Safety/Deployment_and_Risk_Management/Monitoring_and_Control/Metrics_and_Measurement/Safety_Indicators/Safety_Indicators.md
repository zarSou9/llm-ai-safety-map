### Mini Description

Measurements designed to detect potential safety violations or risks, including uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution detection, and constraint violation monitoring.

### Description

Safety Indicators encompass the systematic measurement and monitoring approaches designed to detect potential risks, failures, or unsafe behaviors in deployed AI systems. These indicators serve as early warning systems, helping operators identify issues before they manifest as serious problems. Key challenges include developing indicators that can effectively capture subtle signs of misalignment, potential failure modes, or emerging unsafe behaviors while minimizing false positives and maintaining computational efficiency.

The field draws from multiple disciplines, including statistical analysis, anomaly detection, and systems safety engineering, to create comprehensive monitoring frameworks. Current research focuses on developing robust uncertainty estimation techniques, methods for detecting distribution shift and out-of-distribution inputs, and approaches for monitoring adherence to safety constraints. Particular emphasis is placed on creating indicators that remain reliable as systems become more complex and operate in increasingly diverse environments.

Emerging areas of investigation include the development of indicators for detecting deceptive or manipulative behaviors, methods for monitoring higher-order effects and unintended consequences, and techniques for validating the reliability of safety indicators themselves. Researchers are also exploring ways to combine multiple indicators into more holistic safety assessments, including approaches for weighing and aggregating different signals while accounting for their interdependencies and potential failure modes.
