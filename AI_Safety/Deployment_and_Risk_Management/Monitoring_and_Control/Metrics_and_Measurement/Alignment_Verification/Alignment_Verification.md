### Mini Description

Metrics for assessing how well system behavior aligns with intended objectives and values, including both direct behavioral measures and indirect proxies.

### Description

Alignment Verification encompasses methods and frameworks for assessing whether an AI system's behavior truly aligns with its intended objectives and values. This involves developing rigorous approaches to measure and validate that systems not only achieve their stated goals, but do so in ways that respect specified constraints, maintain intended behavioral characteristics, and avoid undesirable shortcuts or deceptive strategies. A key challenge lies in bridging the gap between abstract alignment properties and concrete, measurable indicators.

Current research focuses on developing both formal and empirical approaches to verification. Formal methods attempt to provide mathematical guarantees about system behavior, including proof techniques for bounded optimization and constraint satisfaction. Empirical approaches focus on developing test suites, behavioral analyses, and monitoring frameworks that can detect subtle forms of misalignment through observation and interaction. These approaches often complement each other, with formal methods providing theoretical foundations and empirical methods offering practical validation.

A significant open challenge is the development of verification methods that remain reliable as AI systems become more capable and complex. This includes creating scalable approaches to verification that can handle increasingly sophisticated behaviors, developing methods to detect emergent misalignment in systems with advanced capabilities, and ensuring verification techniques remain robust against potential deception or gaming of the verification process itself. Researchers are particularly focused on methods that can verify alignment across different contexts and under distribution shift.
