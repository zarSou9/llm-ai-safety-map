### Mini Description

Approaches for managing high-dimensional data in detection, including dimension reduction techniques, feature selection, and methods for handling curse of dimensionality.

### Description

Dimensionality Handling addresses the fundamental challenge of detecting anomalies in high-dimensional AI systems where traditional statistical methods often break down. As the number of dimensions increases, data becomes increasingly sparse (the 'curse of dimensionality'), distance metrics become less meaningful, and the computational complexity of detection algorithms grows exponentially. These challenges are particularly acute in modern AI systems, where the dimension of internal representations can reach millions or billions.

Researchers approach this challenge through various strategies, including dimension reduction techniques that preserve relevant structure while eliminating redundant or irrelevant dimensions, manifold learning methods that identify lower-dimensional representations of the data, and feature selection approaches that identify the most informative dimensions for anomaly detection. A key consideration is maintaining detection sensitivity while reducing dimensionality - techniques must preserve the signal that distinguishes anomalous behavior while eliminating noise that could mask such signals.

Current research focuses on developing methods that can automatically adapt to the intrinsic dimension of the data, handle non-linear relationships between dimensions, and maintain interpretability of results after dimension reduction. Particular attention is given to online dimensionality reduction techniques that can operate in real-time on streaming data, and methods that can handle varying degrees of relevance across different dimensions depending on the context or type of anomaly being detected.
