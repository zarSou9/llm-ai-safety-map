### Mini Description

Techniques for detecting changes in time series data, including change point detection, sequential probability ratio tests, and methods for handling temporal dependencies.

### Description

Sequential Analysis in AI safety focuses on methods for detecting changes and anomalies in temporally ordered data streams from AI systems. This includes techniques for identifying both sudden shifts and gradual drifts in system behavior, while accounting for temporal dependencies and autocorrelations that make traditional independent sampling assumptions invalid. The field draws from classical sequential analysis theory while adapting and extending it to handle the unique challenges posed by complex AI systems.

A central challenge is balancing detection speed against accuracy, particularly in online settings where decisions must be made quickly with incomplete information. This involves developing optimal stopping rules, managing false alarm rates over time, and handling multiple simultaneous monitoring tasks. Researchers must also address the challenge of concept drift, where the underlying distribution of normal behavior evolves naturally over time, requiring methods that can distinguish between acceptable evolution and problematic changes.

Current research emphasizes developing methods that can handle non-stationary processes, incorporate multiple scales of temporal dependency, and provide theoretical guarantees on detection performance. Key areas include online learning approaches that can adapt to changing conditions, methods for handling long-range dependencies in sequential data, and techniques for detecting subtle changes that manifest only in higher-order temporal statistics. There is particular interest in approaches that can maintain interpretability while scaling to high-dimensional state spaces.
