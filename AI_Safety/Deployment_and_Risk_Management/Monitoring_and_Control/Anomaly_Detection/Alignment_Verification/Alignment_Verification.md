### Mini Description

Techniques for detecting potential misalignment between system behavior and intended objectives, including monitoring of proxy metrics and checking adherence to specified constraints.

### Description

Alignment verification encompasses methods and techniques for actively monitoring and validating that an AI system's behavior remains consistent with its intended objectives and constraints during deployment. This involves developing concrete, measurable proxies for alignment, implementing continuous verification processes, and establishing clear thresholds for acceptable behavior. The challenge lies in translating often abstract or complex alignment goals into tractable verification criteria while ensuring these proxies themselves don't become problematic optimization targets.

A key focus is on developing robust verification methods that work across different operational contexts and can detect subtle forms of misalignment before they manifest as obvious failures. This includes both formal approaches, such as logical constraints and invariant checking, and empirical methods like behavioral analysis and outcome evaluation. Researchers must balance the trade-off between verification thoroughness and computational feasibility, particularly for complex systems where exhaustive verification may be intractable.

Current research challenges include developing verification methods that can handle increasingly sophisticated AI systems, addressing the scalability of formal verification approaches, and creating reliable techniques for verifying alignment in systems with learned behaviors or those operating in novel environments. There is particular emphasis on methods that can verify alignment properties that may be difficult to specify formally, such as value learning and corrigibility, as well as techniques for combining multiple verification approaches to provide stronger guarantees.
