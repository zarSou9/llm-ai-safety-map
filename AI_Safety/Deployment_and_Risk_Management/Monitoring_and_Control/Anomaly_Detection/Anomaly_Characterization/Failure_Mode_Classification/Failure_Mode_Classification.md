### Mini Description

Systems for categorizing anomalies based on their characteristics, patterns, and underlying mechanisms, including development of taxonomies and classification frameworks.

### Description

Failure Mode Classification in AI safety focuses on developing systematic approaches to categorize and organize the various ways AI systems can deviate from intended behavior or fail. This involves creating comprehensive taxonomies that capture both known failure patterns and novel types of failures as they emerge. The challenge lies in developing classification schemes that are both precise enough to be technically useful and general enough to accommodate new failure modes as AI systems become more complex.

A key consideration is the multi-dimensional nature of AI failures, which can manifest across different levels of abstraction - from low-level technical malfunctions to high-level alignment failures. Classification systems must account for both the mechanism of failure (how it occurs) and the nature of the failure (what goes wrong), while also considering factors such as detectability, frequency, and potential for mitigation. This requires balancing between different classification approaches, from bottom-up empirical categorization to top-down theoretical frameworks.

Current research emphasizes the development of unified classification frameworks that can support both immediate operational needs and longer-term safety research. This includes work on hierarchical classification systems that can link specific failure instances to broader categories of risk, methods for identifying and classifying novel failure modes, and approaches for maintaining and updating classification schemes as our understanding of AI safety evolves. Particular attention is given to ensuring classifications remain useful across different AI architectures and deployment contexts.
