    "title": "FractalAD: A simple industrial anomaly detection method using fractal anomaly generation and backbone knowledge distillation",
    "published_date": "2023-01-30",
    "abstract": "While industrial anomaly detection (AD) technology has experienced notable advancements in recent years, the challenges of generating realistic anomalies and acquiring a deep understanding of normal patterns persist. In this research, we introduce FractalAD, an end-to-end industrial anomaly detection method. The training dataset is curated by synthesizing fractal images and patches derived from normal samples. This unique fractal anomaly generation method is meticulously crafted to capture the intricate morphology of anomalies comprehensively. Furthermore, we have devised a knowledge distillation structure, aimed at extracting inherent knowledge present in normal samples. To bridge the gap between a teacher and a student model, discrepancies are translated into anomaly attention through a cosine similarity attention module. Notably, our proposed method facilitates the utilization of an end-to-end semantic segmentation network for anomaly detection, seamlessly integrating into the existing framework without introducing additional trainable parameters to the backbone and segmentation head. It exhibits clear advantages over alternative methods in terms of both training efficiency and inference speed. The outcomes of ablation studies underscore the efficacy of both fractal anomaly generation and backbone knowledge distillation. Performance experiments substantiate the competitive standing of FractalAD, showcasing commendable results on the MVTec AD dataset and MVTec 3D-AD dataset when compared to other state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods."

    "title": "Hierarchical Federated Learning based Anomaly Detection using Digital Twins for Smart Healthcare",
    "published_date": "2021-11-24",
    "abstract": "Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge cloudlets.",

    "title": "An Improved KNN-Based Efficient Log Anomaly Detection Method with Automatically Labeled Samples",
    "abstract": "Logs that record system abnormal states (anomaly logs) can be regarded as outliers, and the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm has relatively high accuracy in outlier detection methods. Therefore, we use the kNN algorithm to detect anomalies in the log data. However, there are some problems when using the kNN algorithm to detect anomalies, three of which are: excessive vector dimension leads to inefficient kNN algorithm, unlabeled log data cannot support the kNN algorithm, and the imbalance of the number of log data distorts the classification decision of kNN algorithm. In order to solve these three problems, we propose an efficient log anomaly detection method based on an improved kNN algorithm with an automatically labeled sample set. This method first proposes a log parsing method based on N-gram and frequent pattern mining (FPM) method, which reduces the dimension of the log vector converted with Term frequency.Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technology. Then we use clustering and self-training method to get labeled log data sample set from historical logs automatically. Finally, we improve the kNN algorithm using average weighting technology, which improves the accuracy of the kNN algorithm on unbalanced samples. The method in this article is validated on six log datasets with different types.",

    "title": "An Efficient One-Class SVM for Anomaly Detection in the Internet of Things",
    "published_date": "2021-04-22",
    "abstract": "Insecure Internet of things (IoT) devices pose significant threats to critical infrastructure and the Internet at large; detecting anomalous behavior from these devices remains of critical importance, but fast, efficient, accurate anomaly detection (also called\"novelty detection\") for these classes of devices remains elusive. One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) are one of the state-of-the-art approaches for novelty detection (or anomaly detection) in machine learning, due to their flexibility in fitting complex nonlinear boundaries between {normal} and {novel} data. IoT devices in smart homes and cities and connected building infrastructure present a compelling use case for novelty detection with OCSVM due to the variety of devices, traffic patterns, and types of anomalies that can manifest in such environments. Much previous research has thus applied OCSVM to novelty detection for IoT. Unfortunately, conventional OCSVMs introduce significant memory requirements and are computationally expensive at prediction time as the size of the train set grows, requiring space and time that scales with the number of training points. These memory and computational constraints can be prohibitive in practical, real-world deployments, where large training sets are typically needed to develop accurate models when fitting complex decision boundaries. In this work, we extend so-called Nystr\\\"om and (Gaussian) Sketching approaches to OCSVM, by combining these methods with clustering and Gaussian mixture models to achieve significant speedups in prediction time and space in various IoT settings, without sacrificing detection accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Safety and resilience are critical for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We introduce MAVFI, the micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) resilience analysis methodology to assess the effect of silent data corruption (SDC) on UAVs' mission metrics, such as flight time and success rate, for accurately measuring system resilience. To enhance the safety and resilience of robot systems bound by size, weight, and power (SWaP), we offer two low-overhead anomaly-based SDC detection and recovery algorithms based on Gaussian statistical models and autoencoder neural networks. Our anomaly error protection techniques are validated in numerous simulated environments. We demonstrate that the autoencoder-based technique can recover up to all failure cases in our studied scenarios with a compu-tational overhead of no more than 0.0062%. Our application-aware resilience analysis framework, MAVFI, can be utilized to comprehensively test the resilience of other Robot Operating System (ROS)-based applications and is publicly available at https://github.com/harvard-edge/MAVBench/tree/mavfi.",
