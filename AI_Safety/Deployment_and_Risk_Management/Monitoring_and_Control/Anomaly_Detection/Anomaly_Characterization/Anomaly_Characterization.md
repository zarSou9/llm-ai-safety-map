### Mini Description

Methods for analyzing and categorizing detected anomalies, including root cause analysis, severity assessment, and prediction of potential consequences.

### Description

Anomaly characterization focuses on understanding and classifying detected anomalies in AI system behavior to inform appropriate responses and preventive measures. This involves developing frameworks for categorizing different types of anomalies, determining their severity and potential impact, and identifying their underlying causes. The field combines techniques from root cause analysis, failure mode classification, and impact assessment to build comprehensive understanding of system deviations.

A key challenge lies in developing robust taxonomies that can categorize novel types of anomalies while maintaining practical utility for operators and researchers. This requires balancing between granular technical classification and higher-level categorization that supports decision-making. The field increasingly emphasizes the importance of causal analysis and counterfactual reasoning to understand not just what happened, but why it happened and what could have happened.

Current research focuses on developing more sophisticated characterization methods that can handle complex, interconnected anomalies and provide actionable insights. This includes work on automated diagnosis systems, methods for predicting anomaly progression and potential consequences, and techniques for identifying systemic vulnerabilities that may have contributed to the anomaly. There is particular emphasis on methods that can generalize across different types of AI systems and deployment contexts.
