    "title": "Disaster Anomaly Detector via Deeper FCDDs for Explainable Initial Responses",
    "published_date": "2023-06-05",
    "abstract": "Extreme natural disasters can have devastating effects on both urban and rural areas. In any disaster event, an initial response is the key to rescue within 72 hours and prompt recovery. During the initial stage of disaster response, it is important to quickly assess the damage over a wide area and identify priority areas. Among machine learning algorithms, deep anomaly detection is effective in detecting devastation features that are different from everyday features. In addition, explainable computer vision applications should justify the initial responses. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection application utilizing deeper fully convolutional data descriptions (FCDDs), that enables the localization of devastation features and visualization of damage-marked heatmaps. More specifically, we show numerous training and test results for a dataset AIDER with the four disaster categories: collapsed buildings, traffic incidents, fires, and flooded areas. We also implement ablation studies of anomalous class imbalance and the data scale competing against the normal class. Our experiments provide results of high accuracies over 95% for F1. Furthermore, we found that the deeper FCDD with a VGG16 backbone consistently outperformed other baselines CNN27, ResNet101, and Inceptionv3. This study presents a new solution that offers a disaster anomaly detection application for initial responses with higher accuracy and devastation explainability, providing a novel contribution to the prompt disaster recovery problem in the research area of anomaly scene understanding. Finally, we discuss future works to improve more robust, explainable applications for effective initial responses."

    "title": "Cyber-Attack Event Analysis for EV Charging Stations",
    "published_date": "2022-11-15",
    "abstract": "Safe and secure electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are important in smart transportation infrastructure. The prevalence of EVCSs has rapidly increased over time in response to the rising demand for EV charging. However, developments in information and communication technologies (ICT) have made the cyber-physical system (CPS) of EVCSs susceptible to cyber-attacks, which might destabilize the infrastructure of the electric grid as well as the environment for charging. This study suggests a 5Ws & 1H-based investigation approach to deal with cyber-attack-related incidents due to the incapacity of the current investigation frameworks to comprehend and handle these mishaps. Also, a stochastic anomaly detection system (ADS) is proposed to identify the anomalies, abnormal activities, and unusual operations of the station entities as a post cyber event analysis.",

    "title": "Online Self-Evolving Anomaly Detection in Cloud Computing Environments",
    "published_date": "2021-11-16",
    "abstract": "Modern cloud computing systems contain hundreds to thousands of computing and storage servers. Such a scale, combined with ever-growing system complexity, is causing a key challenge to failure and resource management for dependable cloud computing. Autonomic failure detection is a crucial technique for understanding emergent, cloud-wide phenomena and self-managing cloud resources for system-level dependability assurance. To detect failures, we need to monitor the cloud execution and collect runtime performance data. These data are usually unlabeled, and thus a prior failure history is not always available in production clouds. In this paper, we present a \\emph{self-evolving anomaly detection} (SEAD) framework for cloud dependability assurance. Our framework self-evolves by recursively exploring newly verified anomaly records and continuously updating the anomaly detector online. As a distinct advantage of our framework, cloud system administrators only need to check a small number of detected anomalies, and their decisions are leveraged to update the detector. Thus, the detector evolves following the upgrade of system hardware, update of the software stack, and change of user workloads. Moreover, we design two types of detectors, one for general anomaly detection and the other for type-specific anomaly detection. With the help of self-evolving techniques, our detectors can achieve 88.94\\% in sensitivity and 94.60\\% in specificity on average, which makes them suitable for real-world deployment.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Federated Learning based Anomaly Detection using Digital Twins for Smart Healthcare",
    "published_date": "2021-11-24",
    "abstract": "Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge cloudlets.",

    "title": "An Efficient One-Class SVM for Anomaly Detection in the Internet of Things",
    "published_date": "2021-04-22",
    "abstract": "Insecure Internet of things (IoT) devices pose significant threats to critical infrastructure and the Internet at large; detecting anomalous behavior from these devices remains of critical importance, but fast, efficient, accurate anomaly detection (also called\"novelty detection\") for these classes of devices remains elusive. One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) are one of the state-of-the-art approaches for novelty detection (or anomaly detection) in machine learning, due to their flexibility in fitting complex nonlinear boundaries between {normal} and {novel} data. IoT devices in smart homes and cities and connected building infrastructure present a compelling use case for novelty detection with OCSVM due to the variety of devices, traffic patterns, and types of anomalies that can manifest in such environments. Much previous research has thus applied OCSVM to novelty detection for IoT. Unfortunately, conventional OCSVMs introduce significant memory requirements and are computationally expensive at prediction time as the size of the train set grows, requiring space and time that scales with the number of training points. These memory and computational constraints can be prohibitive in practical, real-world deployments, where large training sets are typically needed to develop accurate models when fitting complex decision boundaries. In this work, we extend so-called Nystr\\\"om and (Gaussian) Sketching approaches to OCSVM, by combining these methods with clustering and Gaussian mixture models to achieve significant speedups in prediction time and space in various IoT settings, without sacrificing detection accuracy.",

    "title": "A Systematic Review on Anomaly Detection for Cloud Computing Environments",
    "abstract": "The detection of anomalies in data is a far-reaching field of research which also applies to the field of cloud computing in several different ways: from the detection of various types of intrusions to the detection of hardware failures, many publications address how far anomaly detection methods are able to meet the specific requirements of a cloud-based network. Since there is still no comprehensive overview of this constantly growing field of research, this literature review provides a systematic evaluation of 215 publications that can be considered as representative for the last ten years of this scientific development. Our analysis identifies three main methodological areas (machine learning, deep learning, statistical approaches) and summarizes how exactly the corresponding models are applied for the detection of anomalies. Furthermore, we clarify which concrete application areas are typically addressed by anomaly detection in the context of cloud computing environments and which related public datasets are often used for evaluations. Finally, we discuss the implications of the literature review and provide directions for future research.",
