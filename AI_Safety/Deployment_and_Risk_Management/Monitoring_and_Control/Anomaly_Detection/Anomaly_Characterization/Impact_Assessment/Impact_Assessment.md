### Mini Description

Frameworks and methods for evaluating the severity, scope, and potential consequences of detected anomalies, including both immediate and long-term effects.

### Description

Impact Assessment in AI safety focuses on systematically evaluating the consequences and implications of detected anomalies in AI systems. This involves quantifying both immediate operational impacts and potential downstream effects across multiple dimensions including safety, performance, reliability, and broader societal implications. The challenge lies in developing frameworks that can handle uncertainty, account for complex interdependencies, and provide actionable insights for decision-makers working under time pressure.

A key consideration is the development of standardized severity scales and impact metrics that can be consistently applied across different types of anomalies and system contexts. This requires balancing between quantitative measures (like performance degradation or resource consumption) and qualitative assessments (such as potential ethical implications or reputational risks). Researchers work to develop methods that can account for both direct effects and potential cascade failures, where seemingly minor anomalies might trigger larger systemic issues.

Current research emphasizes the need for dynamic assessment frameworks that can adapt to evolving system capabilities and deployment contexts. This includes work on probabilistic risk assessment methods, scenario analysis techniques, and approaches for handling unknown unknowns in impact evaluation. Particular attention is given to developing methods that can rapidly estimate worst-case scenarios while avoiding both over- and under-estimation of risks, enabling proportionate response allocation.
