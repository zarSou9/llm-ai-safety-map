    "title": "A normative theory of social conflict",
    "published_date": "2023-03-07",
    "abstract": "Social hierarchy in animal groups carries a crucial adaptive function by reducing conflict and injury while protecting valuable group resources. Social hierarchy is dynamic and can be altered by social conflict, agonistic interactions, and aggression. Understanding social conflict and aggressive behavior is of profound importance to our society and welfare. In this study, we developed a quantitative theory of social conflict. We modeled individual agonistic interactions as a normal-form game between two agents. We assumed that the agents use Bayesian inference to update their beliefs about their strength or their opponent's strength and to derive optimal actions. We compared the results of our model to behavioral and whole-brain neural activity data obtained for a large (n=116) population of mice engaged in agonistic interactions. We find that both types of data are consistent with the first-level Theory of Mind model (1-ToM) in which mice form both\"primary\"beliefs about their and their opponent's strengths as well as the\"secondary\"beliefs about the beliefs of their opponents. Our model helps identify brain regions that carry information about these levels of beliefs. Overall, we both propose a model to describe agonistic interactions and support our quantitative results with behavioral and neural activity data.",

    "title": "Being a leader or being the leader: The evolution of institutionalised hierarchy",
    "published_date": "2019-07-01",
    "abstract": "Human social hierarchy has the unique characteristic of existing in two forms. Firstly, as an informal hierarchy where leaders and followers are implicitly defined by their personal characteristics, and secondly, as an institutional hierarchy where leaders and followers are explicitly appointed by group decision. Although both forms can reduce the time spent in organising collective tasks, institutional hierarchy imposes additional costs. It is therefore natural to question why it emerges at all. The key difference lies in the fact that institutions can create hierarchy with only a single leader, which is unlikely to occur in unregulated informal hierarchy. To investigate if this difference can affect group decision-making and explain the evolution of institutional hierarchy, we first build an opinion-formation model that simulates group decision making. We show that in comparison to informal hierarchy, a single-leader hierarchy reduces (i) the time a group spends to reach consensus, (ii) the variation in consensus time, and (iii) the rate of increase in consensus time as group size increases. We then use this model to simulate the cost of organising a collective action which produces resources, and integrate this into an evolutionary model where individuals can choose between informal or institutional hierarchy. Our results demonstrate that groups evolve preferences towards institutional hierarchy, despite the cost of creating an institution, as it provides a greater organisational advantage which is less affected by group size and inequality."

    "title": "Tyranny to Anarchy: Regimes of Organisational Influence on Directed Hierarchical Graphs",
    "published_date": "2019-09-27",
    "abstract": "Social organisational is critical to coordinated behaviour with a diverse range of management structures. In almost all organisations, a power structure exists with managers and subordinates. Often a change in one part can cause long-term cascades throughout the organisation, leading to inefficiencies and confusion. As organisations grow in size and complexity, as well as change the way they share information and power, we analyse how their resilience to disturbances is affected. Here, we consider majority rule dynamics on organisations modelled as hierarchical directed graphs, where the direction indicates task flow. We utilise a topological measure called the trophic incoherence parameter, $q$, which effectively gauges the stratification of power structure in an organisation. This is shown to bound regimes of behaviour. There is fast consensus at low $q$ (e.g. tyranny), slow consensus at mid $q$ (e.g. democracy), and no consensus at high $q$ (e.g. anarchy). These regimes are investigated analytically and empirically with diverse case studies in the Roman Army, US Government, and a healthcare organisation. Our work has widespread application in the design of organisations as well as analysing how some become inefficient and stagnate."

    "title": "The importance of conflict resolution techniques in autonomous agile teams",
    "published_date": "2018-05-21",
    "abstract": "Today, software companies usually organize their work in teams. Social science research on team development has shown that for a team to reach a productive and autonomous stage, it has to be able to manage internal conflicts and disagreements efficiently. To better facilitate the team development process, we argue that software engineers needs additional training in negotiation skills and conflict resolution. In this position paper, we outline ideas for what aspects to consider in such training. As an example, we argue that a majority of the conflicts originate from team-level factors and that they, therefore, should be managed on the team-level instead of in relation to dyads.",

    "title": "The Price of Governance: A Middle Ground Solution to Coordination in Organizational Control",
    "published_date": "2018-11-09",
    "abstract": "Achieving coordination is crucial in organizational control. This paper investigates a middle ground solution between decentralized interactions and centralized administrations for coordinating agents beyond inefficient behavior. We first propose the price of governance (PoG) to evaluate how such a middle ground solution performs in terms of effectiveness and cost. We then propose a hierarchical supervision framework to explicitly model the PoG, and define step by step how to realize the core principle of the framework and compute the optimal PoG for a control problem. Two illustrative case studies are carried out to exemplify the applications of the proposed framework and its methodology. Results show that the hierarchical supervision framework is capable of promoting coordination among agents while bounding administrative cost to a minimum in different kinds of organizational control problems."

    "title": "Referent Role and Conflict Management Styles: An Empirical Study with Korean Central Government Employees",
    "abstract": "AbstractThis study explored the relationship between referent role (superior, subordinate, and peer) and the styles of managing interpersonal conflict. The target population of this study was Korean central government employees classified as General Service (GS). This study used cluster sampling. Six sample clusters were randomly selected in the first stage. Then a sample of departments within selected Ministries was drawn, and finally a total 700 employees were randomly selected from within 12 departments. Seven hundred employees were contacted, resulting in usable returns from 431. A multiple discriminant analysis was performed, resulting in two significant canonical discriminant functions. Support was found for the relationship between referent role and the styles of managing interpersonal conflict. The Korean central government employees were primarily competing (dominating) with subordinates, compromising with peers, and accommodating with superiors. Implications of the research findings for training...",
