    "title": "Societal Adaptation to Advanced AI",
    "published_date": "2024-05-16",
    "abstract": "Existing strategies for managing risks from advanced AI systems often focus on affecting what AI systems are developed and how they diffuse. However, this approach becomes less feasible as the number of developers of advanced AI grows, and impedes beneficial use-cases as well as harmful ones. In response, we urge a complementary approach: increasing societal adaptation to advanced AI, that is, reducing the expected negative impacts from a given level of diffusion of a given AI capability. We introduce a conceptual framework which helps identify adaptive interventions that avoid, defend against and remedy potentially harmful uses of AI systems, illustrated with examples in election manipulation, cyberterrorism, and loss of control to AI decision-makers. We discuss a three-step cycle that society can implement to adapt to AI. Increasing society's ability to implement this cycle builds its resilience to advanced AI. We conclude with concrete recommendations for governments, industry, and third-parties.",

    "title": "Bridging the Global Divide in AI Regulation: A Proposal for a Contextual, Coherent, and Commensurable Framework",
    "published_date": "2023-03-20",
    "abstract": "As debates on potential societal harm from artificial intelligence (AI) culminate in legislation and international norms, a global divide is emerging in both AI regulatory frameworks and international governance structures. In terms of local regulatory frameworks, the European Union (E.U.), Canada, and Brazil follow a horizontal or lateral approach that postulates the homogeneity of AI, seeks to identify common causes of harm, and demands uniform human interventions. In contrast, the United States (U.S.), the United Kingdom (U.K.), Israel, and Switzerland (and potentially China) have pursued a context-specific or modular approach, tailoring regulations to the specific use cases of AI systems. This paper argues for a context-specific approach to effectively address evolving risks in diverse mission-critical domains, while avoiding social costs associated with one-size-fits-all approaches. However, to enhance the systematicity and interoperability of international norms and accelerate global harmonization, this paper proposes an alternative contextual, coherent, and commensurable (3C) framework. To ensure contextuality, the framework (i) bifurcates the AI life cycle into two phases: learning and deployment for specific tasks, instead of defining foundation or general-purpose models; and (ii) categorizes these tasks based on their application and interaction with humans as follows: autonomous, discriminative (allocative, punitive, and cognitive), and generative AI. To ensure coherency, each category is assigned specific regulatory objectives replacing 2010s vintage AI ethics. To ensure commensurability, the framework promotes the adoption of international standards for measuring and mitigating risks.",

    "title": "Edit at your own risk: evaluating the robustness of edited models to distribution shifts",
    "published_date": "2023-02-28",
    "abstract": "The current trend toward ever-larger models makes standard retraining procedures an ever-more expensive burden. For this reason, there is growing interest in model editing, which enables computationally inexpensive, interpretable, post-hoc model modifications. While many model editing techniques are promising, research on the properties of edited models is largely limited to evaluation of validation accuracy. The robustness of edited models is an important and yet mostly unexplored topic. In this paper, we employ recently developed techniques from the field of deep learning robustness to investigate both how model editing affects the general robustness of a model, as well as the robustness of the specific behavior targeted by the edit. We find that edits tend to reduce general robustness, but that the degree of degradation depends on the editing algorithm and layers chosen. Motivated by these observations we introduce a new model editing algorithm, 1-layer interpolation (1-LI), which uses weight-space interpolation to navigate the trade-off between editing task accuracy and general robustness.",

    "title": "Parametrically Retargetable Decision-Makers Tend To Seek Power",
    "published_date": "2022-06-27",
    "abstract": "If capable AI agents are generally incentivized to seek power in service of the objectives we specify for them, then these systems will pose enormous risks, in addition to enormous benefits. In fully observable environments, most reward functions have an optimal policy which seeks power by keeping options open and staying alive. However, the real world is neither fully observable, nor must trained agents be even approximately reward-optimal. We consider a range of models of AI decision-making, from optimal, to random, to choices informed by learning and interacting with an environment. We discover that many decision-making functions are retargetable, and that retargetability is sufficient to cause power-seeking tendencies. Our functional criterion is simple and broad. We show that a range of qualitatively dissimilar decision-making procedures incentivize agents to seek power. We demonstrate the flexibility of our results by reasoning about learned policy incentives in Montezuma's Revenge. These results suggest a safety risk: Eventually, retargetable training procedures may train real-world agents which seek power over humans.",

    "published_date": "2022-01-27",
    "abstract": "Building artificial intelligence (AI) that aligns with human values is an unsolved problem. Here, we developed a human-in-the-loop research pipeline called Democratic AI, in which reinforcement learning is used to design a social mechanism that humans prefer by majority. A large group of humans played an online investment game that involved deciding whether to keep a monetary endowment or to share it with others for collective benefit. Shared revenue was returned to players under two different redistribution mechanisms, one designed by the AI and the other by humans. The AI discovered a mechanism that redressed initial wealth imbalance, sanctioned free riders, and successfully won the majority vote. By optimizing for human preferences, Democratic AI may be a promising method for value-aligned policy innovation.",

    "title": "Adaptation and Generalization for Unknown Sensitive Factors of Variations",
    "published_date": "2021-07-28",
    "abstract": "Assured AI in unrestricted settings is a critical problem. Our framework addresses AI assurance challenges lying at the intersection of domain adaptation, fairness, and counterfactuals analysis, operating via the discovery and intervention on factors of variations in data (e.g. weather or illumination conditions) that significantly affect the robustness of AI models. Robustness is understood here as insensitivity of the model performance to variations in sensitive factors. Sensitive factors are traditionally set in a supervised setting, whereby factors are known a-priori (e.g. for fairness this could be factors like sex or race). In contrast, our motivation is real-life scenarios where less, or nothing, is actually known a-priori about certain factors that cause models to fail. This leads us to consider various settings (unsupervised, domain generalization, semi-supervised) that correspond to different degrees of incomplete knowledge about those factors. Therefore, our two step approach works by a) discovering sensitive factors that cause AI systems to fail in a unsupervised fashion, and then b) intervening models to lessen these factor's influence. Our method considers 3 interventions consisting of Augmentation, Coherence, and Adversarial Interventions (ACAI). We demonstrate the ability for interventions on discovered/source factors to generalize to target/real factors. We also demonstrate how adaptation to real factors of variations can be performed in the semi-supervised case where some target factor labels are known, via automated intervention selection. Experiments show that our approach improves on baseline models, with regard to achieving optimal utility vs. sensitivity/robustness tradeoffs."
