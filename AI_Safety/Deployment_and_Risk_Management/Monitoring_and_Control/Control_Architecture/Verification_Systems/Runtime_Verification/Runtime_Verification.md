### Mini Description

Systems for continuously monitoring and verifying compliance with specified properties during operation, including real-time checking of safety constraints and control invariants.

### Description

Runtime Verification focuses on monitoring and checking that AI control systems maintain their specified properties and constraints during actual operation. Unlike static analysis performed before deployment, runtime verification deals with the dynamic behavior of systems as they interact with real-world environments, making decisions and responding to inputs. This includes monitoring safety invariants, checking control flow properties, and verifying that intervention mechanisms remain responsive and effective.

A key challenge in runtime verification is balancing comprehensive monitoring with performance constraints. Systems must detect violations quickly enough to prevent unsafe behaviors while avoiding excessive computational overhead that could impact system responsiveness. This has led to research in efficient monitoring algorithms, selective verification approaches that focus on critical properties, and distributed verification architectures that can scale with system complexity.

Current research explores methods for handling temporal properties, verifying probabilistic guarantees in real-time, and developing monitoring approaches that can adapt to changing system behaviors and environmental conditions. Particular attention is given to verification under uncertainty, including techniques for handling partial observability and methods for quantifying confidence in verification results. Emerging areas include online learning of verification models and the development of predictive monitoring approaches that can anticipate potential violations before they occur.
