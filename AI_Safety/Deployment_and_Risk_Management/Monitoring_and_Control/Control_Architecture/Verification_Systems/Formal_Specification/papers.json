    "title": "Formal Verification of Digital Twins with TLA and Information Leakage Control",
    "published_date": "2024-11-27",
    "abstract": "Verifying the correctness of a digital twin provides a formal guarantee that the digital twin operates as intended. Digital twin verification is challenging due to the presence of uncertainties in the virtual representation, the physical environment, and the bidirectional flow of information between physical and virtual. A further challenge is that a digital twin of a complex system is composed of distributed components. This paper presents a methodology to specify and verify digital twin behavior, translating uncertain processes into a formally verifiable finite state machine. We use the Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) to create a specification, an implementation abstraction that defines the properties required for correct system behavior. Our approach includes a novel weakening of formal security properties, allowing controlled information leakage while preserving theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate this approach on a digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle, verifying synchronization of physical-to-virtual and virtual-to-digital data flows to detect unintended misalignments."

    "title": "A General Framework for Verification and Control of Dynamical Models via Certificate Synthesis",
    "published_date": "2023-09-12",
    "abstract": "An emerging branch of control theory specialises in certificate learning, concerning the specification of a desired (possibly complex) system behaviour for an autonomous or control model, which is then analytically verified by means of a function-based proof. However, the synthesis of controllers abiding by these complex requirements is in general a non-trivial task and may elude the most expert control engineers. This results in a need for automatic techniques that are able to design controllers and to analyse a wide range of elaborate specifications. In this paper, we provide a general framework to encode system specifications and define corresponding certificates, and we present an automated approach to formally synthesise controllers and certificates. Our approach contributes to the broad field of safe learning for control, exploiting the flexibility of neural networks to provide candidate control and certificate functions, whilst using SMT-solvers to offer a formal guarantee of correctness. We test our framework by developing a prototype software tool, and assess its efficacy at verification via control and certificate synthesis over a large and varied suite of benchmarks.",

    "title": "Formal Verification of a Controller Implementation in Fixed-Point Arithmetic",
    "published_date": "2021-12-02",
    "abstract": "For the implementations of controllers on digital processors, certain limitations, e.g. in the instruction set and register length, need to be taken into account, especially for safety-critical applications. This work aims to provide a computer-certified inductive definition for the control functions that are implemented on such processors accompanied with the fixed-point data type in a proof assistant. Using these inductive definitions we formally ensure correct realization of the controllers on a digital processor. Our results guarantee overflow-free computations of the implemented control algorithm. The method presented in this paper currently supports functions that are defined as polynomials within an arbitrary fixed-point structure. We demonstrate the verification process in the case study on an example with different scenarios of fixed-point type implementations."

    "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on Specification and Design Languages (FDL 2019)",
    "abstract": "The Forum on Specification and Design Languages (FDL) is a well-established international venue to exchange experiences and promote new trends in the application of languages, their associated design methods, and tools for the design of electronic systems. Electronic systems of interest to FDL include (but are not limited to) those that are used in Internet of Things (IoT), CyberPhysical Systems, mixed criticality embedded systems, embedded systems for high-performance computing and driver assistance, real-time systems, and reconfigurable and secure computing. FDL 2019 was held in Southampton, UK, September 2–4, bringing together 44 researchers and practicioners from 10 countries. The three keynotes covered themes ranging from designing heterogeneous domain-specific languages and compilers (David Broman, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm) over balancing implementability, understandability, and expressiveness in language design (Stephen A. Edwards, Columbia University, New York) to formal languages for embedded critical software (Marc Pouzet, École Normale Supérieure, Paris). In addition, the technical program of FDL 2019 contained two tutorials, two panels, and six technical sessions with a total of 26 presentations. To allow for more in-depth treatment of selected contributions and to further broaden the audience, an open call was made for this special issue in ACM TECS. As a result, six updated and extended papers from FDL'19 are included here, joined by a seventh paper on original work not presented at FDL before. “SystemC implementation of Stochastic Petri Nets for Parametrization of Biological Networks” is authored by Nicola Bombieri, Silvia Scaffeo, Antonio Mastrandrea, Simone Caligola, Tommaso Carlucci, Franco Fummi, Carlo Laudanna, Gabriela Constantin, and Rosalba Giugno. This multidisciplinary paper presents a framework for the modeling and simulation of biological network using Stochastic Petri Nets. To achieve automatic model parametrization, the Stochastic Petri Nets model is implemented into SystemC code, while user-defined properties are specified with a formal specification language. Then, Dynamic Assertion-Based Verification is used to synthesize an appropriate network and parameter configuration that satisfies the defined properties. This allows the system to be simulated under different conditions and network properties. “Event-B Hybridation: A Proof and Refinement Based Framework for Modelling Hybrid Systems,” by Guillaume Dupont, Yamine Ait-Ameur, Marc Pantel, and Neeraj Singh, is an original work not presented at FDL '19. It addresses the difficult topic of the formal proof (in the proof assistant sense) and the incremental design of hybrid systems. The underlying proof assistant is the Rodin Proof Manager and its associated programming language Event-B (based on the B method by Abrial). Hybrid systems are modeled as standard hybrid automata with simple differential equations, which is classical. The strong point of the proposed approach is that the proof obligations",

    "title": "High Order Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions for Temporal Logic Specifications",
    "published_date": "2021-02-12",
    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that stabilizing an affine control system to a desired state while optimizing a quadratic cost subject to state and control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) by using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs). In our own recent work, we defined High Order CBFs (HOCBFs) for systems and constraints with arbitrary relative degrees. In this paper, in order to accommodate initial states that do not satisfy the state constraints and constraints with arbitrary relative degree, we generalize HOCBFs to High Order Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (HOCLBFs). We also show that the proposed HOCLBFs can be used to guarantee the Boolean satisfaction of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae over the state of the system. We illustrate our approach on a safety-critical optimal control problem (OCP) for a unicycle.",

    "title": "Formal Synthesis of Controllers for Uncertain Linear Systems Against -Regular Properties: A Set-Based Approach",
    "published_date": "2021-11-16",
    "abstract": "In this article, we present how to synthesize controllers to enforce <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\omega$</tex-math></inline-formula>-regular properties over linear control systems affected by bounded disturbances. In particular, these controllers are synthesized based on so-called hybrid controlled invariant (HCI) sets. To compute these sets, we first construct a product system between the linear control system and the deterministic Streett automata (DSA) modeling the desired property. Then, we propose a set-based approach, which exploits a new iterative scheme over <italic>hybrid</italic> state sets of the product system, to compute the maximal HCI set. To ensure the termination of the iterative scheme within a finite number of steps, we propose two alternative approaches to compute approximations of the maximal HCI set. Moreover, we show the relations between the (worst-case) complexities of the proposed iterative schemes over hybrid sets and the structure of the DSA modeling <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\omega$</tex-math></inline-formula>-regular properties. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our results via two case studies.",
