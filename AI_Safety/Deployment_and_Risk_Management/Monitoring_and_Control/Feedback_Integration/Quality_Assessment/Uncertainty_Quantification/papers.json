    "title": "Formal Synthesis of Uncertainty Reduction Controllers",
    "published_date": "2024-01-30",
    "abstract": "In its quest for approaches to taming uncertainty in self-adaptive systems (SAS), the research community has largely focused on solutions that adapt the SAS architecture or behaviour in response to uncertainty. By comparison, solutions that reduce the uncertainty affecting SAS (other than through the blanket monitoring of their components and environment) remain underexplored. Our paper proposes a more nuanced, adaptive approach to SAS uncertainty reduction. To that end, we introduce a SAS architecture comprising an uncertainty reduction controller that drives the adaptive acquisition of new information within the SAS adaptation loop, and a tool-supported method that uses probabilistic model checking to synthesise such controllers. The controllers generated by our method deliver optimal trade-offs between SAS uncertainty reduction benefits and new information acquisition costs. We illustrate the use and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach for mobile robot navigation and server infrastructure management SAS.",

    "title": "Using AI Uncertainty Quantification to Improve Human Decision-Making",
    "published_date": "2023-09-19",
    "abstract": "AI Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) has the potential to improve human decision-making beyond AI predictions alone by providing additional probabilistic information to users. The majority of past research on AI and human decision-making has concentrated on model explainability and interpretability, with little focus on understanding the potential impact of UQ on human decision-making. We evaluated the impact on human decision-making for instance-level UQ, calibrated using a strict scoring rule, in two online behavioral experiments. In the first experiment, our results showed that UQ was beneficial for decision-making performance compared to only AI predictions. In the second experiment, we found UQ had generalizable benefits for decision-making across a variety of representations for probabilistic information. These results indicate that implementing high quality, instance-level UQ for AI may improve decision-making with real systems compared to AI predictions alone.",

    "title": "Adaptive control systems with unstructured uncertainty and unmodelled dynamics: a relaxed stability condition",
    "abstract": "As it is well-known, system uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics can deteriorate stability properties of model reference adaptive control systems. Motivated by this standpoint, we first analyse stability conditions of model reference adaptive control architectures in the presence of unstructured system uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. We then synthesise adaptive robustifying terms to relax the aforementioned stability condition, which presents our main contribution. Specifically, these terms in the feedback loop guarantee overall system stability even in the presence of significant system uncertainties when unmodeled dynamics satisfy a condition. We further demonstrate our theoretical findings in an experiment involving an inverted pendulum on a cart (modeled dynamics) coupled with another cart through a spring (unmodeled dynamics).",

    "title": "Î”-UQ: Accurate Uncertainty Quantification via Anchor Marginalization",
    "published_date": "2021-10-05",
    "abstract": "We present $\\Delta$-UQ -- a novel, general-purpose uncertainty estimator using the concept of anchoring in predictive models. Anchoring works by first transforming the input into a tuple consisting of an anchor point drawn from a prior distribution, and a combination of the input sample with the anchor using a pretext encoding scheme. This encoding is such that the original input can be perfectly recovered from the tuple -- regardless of the choice of the anchor. Therefore, any predictive model should be able to predict the target response from the tuple alone (since it implicitly represents the input). Moreover, by varying the anchors for a fixed sample, we can estimate uncertainty in the prediction even using only a single predictive model. We find this uncertainty is deeply connected to improper sampling of the input data, and inherent noise, enabling us to estimate the total uncertainty in any system. With extensive empirical studies on a variety of use-cases, we demonstrate that $\\Delta$-UQ outperforms several competitive baselines. Specifically, we study model fitting, sequential model optimization, model based inversion in the regression setting and out of distribution detection,&calibration under distribution shifts for classification.",

    "title": "Learning-enhanced robust controller synthesis with rigorous statistical and control-theoretic guarantees",
    "published_date": "2021-05-07",
    "abstract": "The combination of machine learning with control offers many opportunities, in particular for robust control. However, due to strong safety and reliability requirements in many real-world applications, providing rigorous statistical and control-theoretic guarantees is of utmost importance, yet difficult to achieve for learning-based control schemes. We present a general framework for learning-enhanced robust control that allows for systematic integration of prior engineering knowledge, is fully compatible with modern robust control and still comes with rigorous and practically meaningful guarantees. Building on the established Linear Fractional Representation and Integral Quadratic Constraints framework, we integrate Gaussian Process Regression as a learning component and state-of-the-art robust controller synthesis. In a concrete robust control example, our approach is demonstrated to yield improved performance with more data, while guarantees are maintained throughout.",

    "title": "Kalman Filter Meets Subjective Logic: A Self-Assessing Kalman Filter Using Subjective Logic",
    "published_date": "2020-07-01",
    "abstract": "Self-assessment is a key to safety and robustness in automated driving. In order to design safer and more robust automated driving functions, the goal is to self-assess the performance of each module in a whole automated driving system. One crucial component in automated driving systems is the tracking of surrounding objects, where the Kalman filter is the most fundamental tracking algorithm. For Kalman filters, some classical online consistency measures exist for self-assessment, which are based on classical probability theory. However, these classical approaches lack the ability to measure the explicit statistical uncertainty within the self-assessment, which is an important quality measure, particularly, if only a small number of samples is available for the self-assessment. In this work, we propose a novel online self-assessment method using subjective logic, which is a modern extension of probabilistic logic that explicitly models the statistical uncertainty. Thus, by embedding classical Kalman filtering into subjective logic, our method additionally features an explicit measure for statistical uncertainty in the self-assessment.",
