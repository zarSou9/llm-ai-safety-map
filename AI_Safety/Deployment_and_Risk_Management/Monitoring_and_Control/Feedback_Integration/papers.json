    "title": "Adaptive Super-Twisting Controller Design for Accurate Trajectory Tracking Performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles",
    "published_date": "2023-03-21",
    "abstract": "In this article, an adaptive super-twisting controller is designed for an agile maneuvering quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to achieve accurate trajectory tracking in the presence of external disturbances. A cascaded control architecture is designed to determine the desired accelerations using the proposed controller and subsequently used to compute the desired orientation and angular rates. Finite-time convergence to the sliding surfaces and closed-loop system stability are analytically proven. Furthermore, the restrictive assumption on the upper bound of the disturbance is relaxed by designing a gain adaptation law and low-pass filtering of the estimated equivalent control. The proper selection of design parameters is discussed in detail. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by high-fidelity software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations and validated by experimental studies.",

    "published_date": "2022-01-09",
    "abstract": "For systems in canonical form with nonvanishing uncertainties/disturbances, this work presents an approach to full-state regulation within prescribed time irrespective of initial conditions. By introducing the smooth hyperbolic-tangent-like function, a nonlinear and time-varying state-feedback control scheme is constructed, which is further extended to address output-feedback-based prescribed-time regulation by invoking the prescribed-time observer, all are applicable over the entire operational time zone. As an alternative to full-state regulation within the user-assignable time interval, the proposed method analytically bridges the divide between linear and nonlinear feedback-based prescribed-time control and is able to achieve asymptotic stability, exponential stability, and prescribed-time stability with a unified control structure.",

    "abstract": "This article proposes a unifying design framework for dynamic feedback controllers that track solution trajectories of time-varying generalized equations, such as local minimizers of nonlinear programs or competitive equilibria (e.g., Nash) of noncooperative games. Inspired by the feedback optimization paradigm, the core idea of the proposed approach is to repurpose classic iterative algorithms for solving generalized equations (e.g., Josephy–Newton, forward–backward splitting) as dynamic feedback controllers by integrating online measurements of the continuous-time nonlinear plant. Sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability and robustness of the algorithm-plant cyber-physical interconnection are derived in a sampled-data setting by combining and tailoring results from (monotone) operator, fixed-point, and nonlinear systems theory. Numerical simulations on smart building automation and competitive supply chain management are presented to support the theoretical findings.",

    "published_date": "2022-11-25",
    "abstract": "This letter addresses the synthesis of safety-critical controllers using estimate feedback. We propose an observer-controller interconnection to ensure that the nonlinear system remains safe despite bounded disturbances on the system dynamics and measurements that correspond to partial state information. The co-design of observers and controllers is critical, since even in undisturbed cases, observers and controllers designed independently may not render the system safe. We propose two approaches to synthesize observer-controller interconnections. The first approach utilizes Input-to-State Stable observers, and the second uses Bounded Error observers. Using these stability and boundedness properties of the observation error, we construct novel Control Barrier Functions that impose inequality constraints on the control inputs which, when satisfied, certifies safety. We propose quadratic program-based controllers to satisfy these constraints, and prove Lipschitz continuity of the derived controllers. Simulations and experiments on a quadrotor demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a distributed model reference adaptive control scheme for optimal tracking of an interconnected dynamical system in the presence of system/interconnection uncertainties. A reference model selection which achieves an optimal tracking for the nominal system is introduced by using linear quadratic regulator theory. Then an adaptive control law is developed for the uncertain interconnected dynamical system, where it employs the specified reference model. It is shown that the control law achieves the desired behaviour such that the output of the system asymptotically tracks the output of the reference model in the presence of the uncertainties. An explicit error bound regarding optimal tracking is also established.",

    "published_date": "2022-01-04",
    "abstract": "While information theory has been introduced to investigate and characterize the control and ﬁltering limitations for a few decades, the existing information-theoretic methods are indirect and cumbersome for analyzing the fundamental limitations of continuous-time systems. To answer this challenge, we lift the information-theoretic analysis to continuous function spaces of inﬁnite dimensions by using Duncan's theorem or the I-MMSE relationships. Continuous-time control and ﬁltering systems are modeled as an additive Gaussian channel with or without feedback, and total information rate is identiﬁed as a control and ﬁltering trade-oﬀ metric and directly computed from the estimation error of channel input. Inequality constraints for the trade-oﬀ metric are derived in a general setting and then applied to capture the fundamental limitations of various control and ﬁltering systems subject to linear and nonlinear plants. For the linear systems, we show that total information rate has similar properties as some established trade-oﬀs, e.g., Bode-type integrals and minimum estimation error. For the nonlinear systems, we provide a direct method to compute the total information rate and its lower bound by the Stratonovich-Kushner equation.",

    "published_date": "2022-03-24",
    "abstract": "The MAPE-K feedback loop has been established as the primary reference model for self-adaptive and autonomous systems in domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and Cyber-Physical Systems. At the same time, the Human Machine Teaming (HMT) paradigm is designed to promote partnerships between humans and autonomous machines. It goes far beyond the degree of collaboration expected in human-on-the-loop and human-in-the-loop systems and emphasizes interactions, partnership, and teamwork between humans and machines. However, while MAPE-K enables fully autonomous behavior, it does not explicitly address the interactions between humans and machines as intended by HMT. In this paper, we present the MAPE-KHMT framework which augments the traditional MAPE-K loop with support for HMT. We identify critical human-machine teaming factors and describe the infrastructure needed across the various phases of the MAPE-K loop in order to effectively support HMT. This includes runtime models that are constructed and populated dynamically across monitoring, analysis, planning, and execution phases to support human-machine partnerships. We illustrate MAPE-KHMT using examples from an autonomous multi-UAV emergency response system, and present guidelines for integrating HMT into MAPE-K.CCS CONCEPTS• Human-centered computing → Collaborative interaction; HCI theory, concepts and models.",

    "published_date": "2021-04-21",
    "abstract": "The stabilization of unstable nonlinear systems and tracking control are challenging engineering problems due to the encompassed nonlinearities in dynamic systems and their scale. In the past decades, numerous observer-based control designs for dynamic systems in which the nonlinearity belongs to Lipschitz functions have been proposed. However, most of them only focus on output feedback and consequently, state feedback design remains less developed. To that end, this paper is dedicated to the problem of full-state feedback controller design for discrete-time Lipschitz nonlinear systems. In addition, we present a simple iterative method for improving the convergence of the closed-loop performance. It is later demonstrated that our approach can be conveniently extended and utilized for output tracking.",

    "published_date": "2021-09-13",
    "abstract": "This letter considers a feedback-based projected gradient method for optimizing systems modeled as algebraic maps. The focus is on a setup where the gradient is corrupted by random errors that follow a sub-Weibull distribution, and where the measurements of the output – which replace the input-output map of the system in the algorithmic updates – may not be available at each iteration. The sub-Weibull error model is particularly well-suited in frameworks where the cost of the problem is learned via Gaussian Process (GP) regression (from functional evaluations) concurrently with the execution of the algorithm; however, it also naturally models setups where nonparametric methods and neural networks are utilized to estimate the cost. Using the sub-Weibull model, and with Bernoulli random variables modeling missing measurements of the system output, we show that the online algorithm generates points that are within a bounded error from the optimal solutions. In particular, we provide error bounds in expectation and in high probability. Numerical results are presented in the context of a demand response problem in smart power grids.",
