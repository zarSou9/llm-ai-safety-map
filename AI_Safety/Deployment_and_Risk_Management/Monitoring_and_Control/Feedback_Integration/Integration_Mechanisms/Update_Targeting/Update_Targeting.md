### Mini Description

Methods for identifying and modifying specific components or behaviors within the system based on feedback, including techniques for localizing changes and minimizing unintended effects.

### Description

Update Targeting focuses on developing precise methods for identifying and modifying specific components or behaviors within AI systems in response to feedback. This involves techniques for localizing changes, analyzing dependencies between system components, and ensuring modifications achieve their intended effects while minimizing unintended consequences. The challenge lies in maintaining system coherence while making targeted adjustments, particularly in complex neural networks and other AI architectures where behavior emerges from the interaction of many components.

A key consideration is the granularity of targeting, ranging from individual neurons or weights to functional modules or behavioral patterns. Researchers must develop methods to accurately map feedback signals to relevant system components, understand the causal relationships between components and observed behaviors, and predict how local changes might propagate through the system. This includes techniques for isolating specific computational pathways, identifying critical nodes or parameters, and maintaining invariants during modifications.

Current research challenges include developing better tools for causal analysis of AI systems, creating more precise targeting mechanisms that work across different architectures, and building reliable methods for verifying that changes remain contained to intended targets. There is particular interest in techniques that can handle targeting in systems with complex internal representations, methods for identifying minimal sufficient changes to achieve desired effects, and approaches for managing updates in systems with learned rather than engineered structure.
