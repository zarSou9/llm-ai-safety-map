    "title": "Globally Intelligent Adaptive Finite-/Fixed- Time Tracking Control for Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems via Composite Learning Approaches",
    "published_date": "2023-03-28",
    "abstract": "This article focuses on the globally composite adaptive law-based intelligent finite-/fixed- time (FnT/FxT) tracking control issue for a family of uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems. First, intelligent approximators with new composite updating laws are developed to model uncertain nonlinear terms, which encompass prediction errors to enhance intelligent approximators' learning behaviors and fewer online learning parameters to diminish computational burden. Then, a novel smooth switching function coupled with robust controllers is designed to pull system states back when the transients are out of the approximators' active domain. After that, a modified FnT/FxT backstepping technique is constructed to render output to follow the reference trajectory, and an adaptive law is employed to alleviate the impact of external disturbances. Moreover, input nonlinearities are considered in the design of control laws. In view of the known actuator magnitude and rate saturations, a novel adaptive fast FxT auxiliary variable system is established to effectively diminish saturation time, and further alleviate the impact of the auxiliary signal on the tracking error. Furthermore, when the input is subject to unknown magnitude saturation, rate saturation and dead-zone simultaneously, a smooth function is introduced to approximate the non-smooth input nonlinearities, where the unknown parameters are modeled via the presented global intelligent approximators. It is theoretically confirmed that the proposed control strategies ensure globally FnT/FxT boundedness of all the closed-loop variables. Finally, the validity of theoretical results is testified via a simulation case.",

    "title": "Adaptive Super-Twisting Controller Design for Accurate Trajectory Tracking Performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles",
    "published_date": "2023-03-21",
    "abstract": "In this article, an adaptive super-twisting controller is designed for an agile maneuvering quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to achieve accurate trajectory tracking in the presence of external disturbances. A cascaded control architecture is designed to determine the desired accelerations using the proposed controller and subsequently used to compute the desired orientation and angular rates. Finite-time convergence to the sliding surfaces and closed-loop system stability are analytically proven. Furthermore, the restrictive assumption on the upper bound of the disturbance is relaxed by designing a gain adaptation law and low-pass filtering of the estimated equivalent control. The proper selection of design parameters is discussed in detail. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by high-fidelity software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations and validated by experimental studies.",

    "title": "Distributed adaptive control for optimal tracking of uncertain interconnected dynamical systems",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a distributed model reference adaptive control scheme for optimal tracking of an interconnected dynamical system in the presence of system/interconnection uncertainties. A reference model selection which achieves an optimal tracking for the nominal system is introduced by using linear quadratic regulator theory. Then an adaptive control law is developed for the uncertain interconnected dynamical system, where it employs the specified reference model. It is shown that the control law achieves the desired behaviour such that the output of the system asymptotically tracks the output of the reference model in the presence of the uncertainties. An explicit error bound regarding optimal tracking is also established.",

    "title": "Consolidated Adaptive T-soft Update for Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2022-02-25",
    "abstract": "Demand for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is gradually increased to enable robots to perform complex tasks, while DRL is known to be unstable. As a technique to stabilize its learning, a target network that slowly and asymptotically matches a main network is widely employed to generate stable pseudo-supervised signals. Recently, T-soft update has been proposed as a noise-robust update rule for the target network and has contributed to improving the DRL performance. However, the noise robustness of T-soft update is specified by a hyperparameter, which should be tuned for each task, and suppression of updates would cause deviation of the two networks. This study develops a consolidated and adaptive T-soft (CAT-soft) update based on approximate maximum likelihood estimation of student-t distribution and an additional consolidation. Since the noise robustness is represented by a model parameter of the student-t distribution, this method makes the noise robustness adaptive. In addition, the parameters of the main network, those that deviate from the target network, are consolidated to the target network. The proposed method outperformed the conventional methods in numerical simulations.",

    "title": "Optimizing Consensus-based Multi-target Tracking with Multiagent Rollout Control Policies",
    "published_date": "2021-02-04",
    "abstract": "This paper considers a multiagent, connected, robotic fleet where the primary functionality of the agents is sensing. A distributed multi-sensor control strategy maximizes the value of the collective sensing capability of the fleet, using an information-driven approach. Each agent individually performs sensor processing (Kalman Filtering and Joint Probabilistic Data Association) to identify trajectories (and associated distributions). Using communication with neighbors, the agent enhances the prediction of the trajectories by a Consensus of Information approach that iteratively calculates the Kullback-Leibler average of trajectory distributions, which enables the calculation of the collective information for the fleet. The dynamics of the agents, the evolution of the identified trajectories for each agent, and the dynamics of individual observed objects are captured as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Using this POMDP and applying rollout with receding horizon control, an optimized non-myopic control policy that maximizes the collective fleet information value is synthesized. Simulations are presented for a scenario with three heterogeneous UAVs performing coordinated target tracking that illustrate the proposed methodology and compare the centralized approach with a contemporary sequential multiagent distributed decision technique.",

    "title": "Systematic Online Tuning of Multirotor UAVs for Accurate Trajectory Tracking Under Wind Disturbances and In-Flight Dynamics Changes",
    "published_date": "2021-06-07",
    "abstract": "The demand for accurate and fast trajectory tracking for multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have grown recently due to advances in UAV avionics technology and application domains. In many applications, the multirotor UAV is required to accurately perform aggressive maneuvers in challenging scenarios like the presence of external wind disturbances or in-flight payload changes. In this paper, we propose a systematic controller tuning approach based on identification results obtained by a recently developed Deep Neural Networks with the Modified Relay Feedback Test (DNN-MRFT) algorithm. We formulate a linear equivalent representation suitable for DNN-MRFT using feedback linearization. This representation enables the analytical investigation of different controller structures and tuning settings, and captures the non-linearity trends of the system. With this approach, the trade-off between performance and robustness in design was made possible which is convenient for the design of controllers of UAVs operating in uncertain environments. We demonstrate that our approach is adaptive and robust through a set of experiments, where accurate trajectory tracking is maintained despite significant changes to the UAV aerodynamic characteristics and the application of wind disturbance. Due to the model-based system design, it was possible to obtain low discrepancy between simulation and experimental results which is beneficial for potential use of the proposed approach for real-time model-based planning and fault detection tasks. We obtained RMSE of 3.59 cm when tracking aggressive trajectories in the presence of strong wind, which is on par with state-of-the-art.",
