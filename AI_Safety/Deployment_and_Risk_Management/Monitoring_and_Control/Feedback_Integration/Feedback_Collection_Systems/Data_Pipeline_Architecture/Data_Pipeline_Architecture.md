### Mini Description

Infrastructure for collecting, storing, and routing feedback data, including systems for handling different data types, ensuring data integrity, and managing collection scale.

### Description

Data Pipeline Architecture in AI feedback collection systems focuses on designing and implementing the infrastructure required to reliably capture, process, and store feedback data from multiple sources. This includes establishing robust data flows, defining schema and storage formats, implementing validation and transformation logic, and ensuring scalability and fault tolerance. The architecture must handle diverse data types ranging from structured metrics to unstructured human feedback while maintaining data integrity and enabling efficient retrieval.

A key challenge is managing the temporal aspects of feedback data, including real-time streaming requirements, historical data retention, and the need to correlate feedback across different timescales. The architecture must support both high-throughput real-time processing for immediate system adjustments and batch processing for deeper analysis. This requires careful consideration of buffering mechanisms, data partitioning strategies, and storage hierarchies that balance accessibility with resource efficiency.

Current research focuses on developing more sophisticated architectures that can adapt to changing requirements while maintaining reliability. This includes work on schema evolution strategies, methods for handling data quality issues at scale, and techniques for managing the growing complexity of feedback data relationships. Particular attention is given to ensuring data lineage tracking, enabling reproducibility, and supporting efficient query patterns for both immediate operational needs and longer-term analysis.
