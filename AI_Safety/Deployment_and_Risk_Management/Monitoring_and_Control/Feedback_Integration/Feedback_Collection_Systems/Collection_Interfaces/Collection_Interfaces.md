### Mini Description

Design and implementation of user interfaces and APIs for gathering feedback, including both human-facing interfaces and machine-to-machine protocols.

### Description

Collection Interfaces focuses on the design and implementation of interaction points through which feedback about AI system behavior is gathered. These interfaces must balance multiple competing requirements: they need to be intuitive and efficient for users while capturing detailed and structured data, support both rapid input for time-sensitive feedback and detailed documentation for complex scenarios, and maintain reliability under varying conditions and usage patterns.

A fundamental challenge is designing interfaces that can accommodate different types of feedback providers and use cases. This includes specialized interfaces for technical operators requiring precise control and detailed monitoring, simplified interfaces for domain experts providing task-specific feedback, and structured interfaces for automated systems sharing machine-readable feedback. Each interface type must carefully consider information density, interaction patterns, and error prevention while maintaining consistency in data quality and format.

Current research explores novel interaction paradigms beyond traditional form-based input, including natural language interfaces, interactive visualizations, and mixed-reality environments for more intuitive feedback collection. There is particular focus on developing adaptive interfaces that can adjust their complexity and presentation based on the user's expertise and current context, as well as interfaces that can guide users toward providing more valuable feedback through intelligent prompting and real-time validation.
