### Mini Description

Infrastructure and protocols for gathering feedback from various sources, including human operators, automated monitoring systems, and system performance metrics.

### Description

Feedback Collection Systems encompass the technical infrastructure and methodological frameworks required to systematically gather feedback about AI system behavior from multiple sources. This includes designing data collection pipelines, establishing protocols for human feedback submission, implementing automated monitoring interfaces, and creating mechanisms to capture indirect feedback from system outcomes and environmental interactions. The challenge lies in building systems that can collect feedback at the appropriate granularity and frequency while maintaining data quality and minimizing collection overhead.

A key consideration is the architecture of collection systems that can handle multiple feedback modalities simultaneously. These range from structured input formats like numerical ratings and categorical assessments to unstructured feedback such as natural language comments and behavioral demonstrations. The systems must also account for different temporal patterns, from continuous real-time streams to discrete periodic submissions, while ensuring proper context preservation and metadata tracking.

Current research focuses on developing more sophisticated collection architectures that can adapt to changing requirements and scale efficiently. This includes work on automated feedback extraction from interaction logs, methods for prompting and eliciting high-quality human feedback, and techniques for managing the trade-off between collection comprehensiveness and operational efficiency. Particular attention is given to ensuring collection systems remain robust under high load and can gracefully handle edge cases while maintaining data integrity.
