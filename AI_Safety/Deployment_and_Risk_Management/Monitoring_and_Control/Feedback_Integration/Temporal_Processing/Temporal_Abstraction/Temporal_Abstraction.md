### Mini Description

Frameworks for representing and reasoning about feedback across different time scales, including methods for temporal aggregation and hierarchical temporal modeling.

### Description

Temporal abstraction in AI feedback systems focuses on creating frameworks and models that can effectively represent and reason about feedback data across different time scales. This involves developing mathematical and computational structures that can capture temporal relationships, dependencies, and patterns while maintaining a coherent understanding of system behavior over time. The key challenge lies in bridging the gap between raw temporal data streams and higher-level temporal concepts that are meaningful for system decision-making and control.

A central aspect of temporal abstraction is the development of hierarchical representations that can capture both fine-grained temporal details and broader temporal patterns. This includes methods for automatically identifying relevant temporal granularities, detecting recurring patterns or cycles, and creating abstract temporal concepts that can be used for reasoning and prediction. Researchers must address challenges such as handling variable-length temporal sequences, managing temporal uncertainty, and maintaining consistency across different levels of temporal abstraction.

Current research emphasizes the development of more sophisticated temporal representation learning approaches, including methods that can automatically discover and adapt to changing temporal patterns. There is particular interest in approaches that can maintain interpretability while scaling to handle complex temporal relationships, as well as techniques for validating the correctness and usefulness of learned temporal abstractions. Key open questions include how to effectively combine domain knowledge with learned temporal abstractions and how to ensure that temporal abstractions remain robust under distribution shift.
