### Mini Description

Frameworks for managing the introduction of AI systems into existing operational infrastructures and their interaction with other deployed systems.

### Description

Integration Architecture focuses on designing frameworks and methodologies for incorporating AI systems into existing operational environments while ensuring seamless interaction with established infrastructure, processes, and other deployed systems. This involves careful consideration of system interfaces, data flows, computational resources, and operational dependencies, as well as strategies for managing potential conflicts and maintaining overall system stability during and after integration.

A key challenge in integration architecture is managing the complexity that arises from introducing AI components into legacy systems while preserving existing functionality and safety properties. This requires developing robust abstraction layers, defining clear integration boundaries, and establishing protocols for handling edge cases and failure modes across system boundaries. Researchers investigate approaches for gradual integration that minimize disruption while allowing for systematic validation of integrated components.

Current research emphasizes the development of modular architectures that can accommodate AI systems with varying capabilities and requirements, while maintaining operational reliability and safety guarantees. Open questions include how to design integration patterns that remain robust as AI systems evolve, how to manage the interaction between multiple AI systems with potentially conflicting objectives, and how to ensure that integration approaches scale effectively across different organizational contexts and technological environments.
