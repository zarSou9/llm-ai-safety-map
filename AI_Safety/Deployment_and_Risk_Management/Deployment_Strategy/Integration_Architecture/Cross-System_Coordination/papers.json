    "title": "Creating Scalable AGI: the Open General Intelligence Framework",
    "published_date": "2024-11-24",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs), have led to significant progress in narrow tasks such as image classification, language translation, coding, and writing. However, these models face limitations in reliability and scalability due to their siloed architectures, which are designed to handle only one data modality (data type) at a time. This single modal approach hinders their ability to integrate the complex set of data points required for real-world challenges and problem-solving tasks like medical diagnosis, quality assurance, equipment troubleshooting, and financial decision-making. Addressing these real-world challenges requires a more capable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system. Our primary contribution is the development of the Open General Intelligence (OGI) framework, a novel systems architecture that serves as a macro design reference for AGI. The OGI framework adopts a modular approach to the design of intelligent systems, based on the premise that cognition must occur across multiple specialized modules that can seamlessly operate as a single system. OGI integrates these modules using a dynamic processing system and a fabric interconnect, enabling real-time adaptability, multi-modal integration, and scalable processing. The OGI framework consists of three key components: (1) Overall Macro Design Guidance that directs operational design and processing, (2) a Dynamic Processing System that controls routing, primary goals, instructions, and weighting, and (3) Framework Areas, a set of specialized modules that operate cohesively to form a unified cognitive system. By incorporating known principles from human cognition into AI systems, the OGI framework aims to overcome the challenges observed in today's intelligent systems, paving the way for more holistic and context-aware problem-solving capabilities.",
    "summary": "The Open General Intelligence (OGI) framework proposes a modular, multi-modal architecture for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), aiming to overcome the limitations of current single-modality AI systems by integrating specialized modules via a dynamic processing system for enhanced scalability and real-world problem-solving."

    "title": "Barriers on the EDGE: A scalable CBF architecture over EDGE for safe aerial-ground multi-agent coordination",
    "published_date": "2024-11-25",
    "abstract": "In this article, we address the problem of designing a scalable control architecture for a safe coordinated operation of a multi-agent system with aerial (UAVs) and ground robots (UGVs) in a confined task space. The proposed method uses Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to impose constraints associated with (i) collision avoidance between agents, (ii) landing of UAVs on mobile UGVs, and (iii) task space restriction. Further, to account for the rapid increase in the number of constraints for a single agent with the increasing number of agents, the proposed architecture uses a centralized-decentralized Edge cluster, where a centralized node (Watcher) activates the relevant constraints, reducing the need for high onboard processing and network complexity. The distributed nodes run the controller locally to overcome latency and network issues. The proposed Edge architecture is experimentally validated using multiple aerial and ground robots in a confined environment performing a coordinated operation.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a scalable, centralized-decentralized edge computing architecture using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for safe multi-agent coordination between UAVs and UGVs in confined spaces, addressing collision avoidance, UAV landing, and task space restrictions. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating computational and communication burdens."

    "published_date": "2024-09-26",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to multi-robot planning and collaboration. We demonstrate a cognitive strategy for robots in human-robot teams that incorporates metacognition, natural language communication, and explainability. The system is embodied using the HARMONIC architecture that flexibly integrates cognitive and control capabilities across the team. We evaluate our approach through simulation experiments involving a joint search task by a team of heterogeneous robots (a UGV and a drone) and a human. We detail the system's handling of complex, real-world scenarios, effective action coordination between robots with different capabilities, and natural human-robot communication. This work demonstrates that the robots' ability to reason about plans, goals, and attitudes, and to provide explanations for actions and decisions are essential prerequisites for realistic human-robot teaming.",

    "published_date": "2024-06-17",
    "abstract": "The intelligent interaction model based on large models reduces the differences in user experience across various system platforms but faces challenges in multi-agent collaboration and resource sharing. To demonstrate a uniform user experience across different foundational software platforms and address resource coordination management challenges, this paper proposes KAOS, a multi-agent operating system based on the open-source Kylin. The research method involves empowering agents with large models to serve applications. First, by introducing management role agents and vertical multi-agent collaboration to construct or replace typical application software. Second, by studying system-level shared resource scheduling strategies to enhance user experience and optimize resource utilization. And finally, by validating the efficiency and superiority of the large model multi-agent operating system through real applications and scoring intelligence. The feasibility of this system is demonstrated, providing a new perspective for the development of multi-agent operating systems. Experimental results show significant advantages of multi-agent collaboration in various application scenarios.",

Additionally, it explores the Convener's role as a message relay and controller of participant interactions, enhancing both scalability and security. These advancements are crucial for ensuring smooth, efficient, and secure interactions in scenarios where multiple AI agents need to collaborate, debate, or contribute to a discussion. The paper elaborates on these concepts and provides practical examples, illustrating their implementation within the conversation envelope structure.",

    "title": "Collaborative UAVs Multi-task Video Processing Optimization Based on Enhanced Distributed Actor-Critic Networks",
    "published_date": "2024-11-16",
    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), intelligent information services are being increasingly integrated across various sectors, including healthcare, industry, and transportation. Traditional solutions rely on centralized cloud processing, which encounters considerable challenges in fulfilling the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of Computer Vision (CV) tasks generated in the resource-constrained infrastructure-less environments. In this paper, we introduce a distributed framework called CoUAV-Pro for multi-task video processing powered by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This framework empowers multiple UAVs to meet the service demands of various computer vision (CV) tasks in infrastructure-less environments, thereby eliminating the need for centralized processing. Specifically, we develop a novel task allocation algorithm that leverages enhanced distributed actor-critic networks within CoUAV-Pro, aiming to optimize task processing efficiency while contending with constraints associated with UAV's energy, computational, and communication resources. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed solution achieves satisfactory performance levels against those of centralized methods across key metrics including task acquisition rates, task latency, and energy consumption.",
    "summary": "CoUAV-Pro, a distributed framework using enhanced distributed actor-critic networks, optimizes multi-task video processing on collaborative UAVs by efficiently allocating tasks while considering resource constraints, outperforming centralized methods in task acquisition rate, latency, and energy consumption."
