    "title": "Automating Staged Rollout with Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2022-04-01",
    "abstract": "Staged rollout is a strategy of incrementally releasing software updates to portions of the user population in order to accelerate defect discovery without incurring catastrophic outcomes such as system wide outages. Some past studies have examined how to quantify and automate staged rollout, but stop short of simultaneously considering multiple product or process metrics explicitly. This paper demonstrates the potential to automate staged rollout with multi-objective reinforcement learning in order to dynamically balance stakeholder needs such as time to deliver new features and downtime incurred by failures due to latent defects.

    "published_date": "2024-01-21",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of reconfiguring Earth observation satellite constellation systems through multiple stages. The Multistage Constellation Reconfiguration Problem (MCRP) aims to maximize the total observation rewards obtained by covering a set of targets of interest through the active manipulation of the orbits and relative phasing of constituent satellites. This paper considers deterministic problem settings in which the targets of interest are known a priori. We propose a novel integer linear programming formulation for MCRP, capable of obtaining provably optimal solutions. To overcome computational intractability due to the combinatorial explosion in solving large-scale instances, we introduce two computationally efficient sequential decision-making methods based on the principles of a myopic policy and a rolling horizon procedure. The computational experiments demonstrate that the devised sequential decision-making approaches yield high-quality solutions with improved computational efficiency over the baseline MCRP. Finally, a case study using Hurricane Harvey data showcases the advantages of multistage constellation reconfiguration over single-stage and no-reconfiguration scenarios.",

    "title": "Distributed Online Rollout for Multivehicle Routing in Unmapped Environments",
    "published_date": "2023-05-24",
    "abstract": "In this work we consider a generalization of the well-known multivehicle routing problem: given a network, a set of agents occupying a subset of its nodes, and a set of tasks, we seek a minimum cost sequence of movements subject to the constraint that each task is visited by some agent at least once. The classical version of this problem assumes a central computational server that observes the entire state of the system perfectly and directs individual agents according to a centralized control scheme. In contrast, we assume that there is no centralized server and that each agent is an individual processor with no a priori knowledge of the underlying network (including task and agent locations). Moreover, our agents possess strictly local communication and sensing capabilities (restricted to a fixed radius around their respective locations), aligning more closely with several real-world multiagent applications. These restrictions introduce many challenges that are overcome through local information sharing and direct coordination between agents. We present a fully distributed, online, and scalable reinforcement learning algorithm for this problem whereby agents self-organize into local clusters and independently apply a multiagent rollout scheme locally to each cluster. We demonstrate empirically via extensive simulations that there exists a critical sensing radius beyond which the distributed rollout algorithm begins to improve over a greedy base policy. This critical sensing radius grows proportionally to the $\\log^*$ function of the size of the network, and is, therefore, a small constant for any relevant network. Our decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm achieves approximately a factor of two cost improvement over the base policy for a range of radii bounded from below and above by two and three times the critical sensing radius, respectively.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a distributed, online reinforcement learning algorithm for solving the multi-vehicle routing problem in unmapped environments with limited communication, using local clustering and rollout within each cluster. The algorithm achieves significant cost reduction compared to a greedy baseline, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness beyond a critical, logarithmically-small sensing radius."

    "title": "LOKO: Localization-Aware Roll-Out Planning for Future Mobile Networks",
    "published_date": "2022-01-11",
    "abstract": "The roll-out phase of the next generation of mobile networks (5G) has started and operators are required to devise deployment solutions while pursuing localization accuracy maximization. Enabling location-based services is expected to be a unique selling point for service providers now able to deliver critical mobile services, e.g., autonomous driving, public safety, remote operations. In this paper, we propose a novel roll-out base station placement solution that, given a Throughput-Positioning Ratio (TPR) target, selects the location of new-generation base stations (among available candidate sites) such that the throughput and localization accuracy are jointly maximized. Moving away from the canonical position error bound (PEB) analysis, we develop a realistic framework in which each positioning measurement is affected by errors depending upon the actual wireless channel between the measuring base station and the target device. Our solution, referred to as LOKO, is a fast-converging algorithm that can be readily applied to current 5G (or future) roll-out processes. LOKO is validated by means of an exhaustive simulation campaign considering real existing deployments of a major European network operator as well as synthetic scenarios.",

    "title": "Deployment Optimization for Shared e-Mobility Systems With Multi-Agent Deep Neural Search",
    "published_date": "2021-11-03",
    "abstract": "Shared e-mobility services have been widely tested and piloted in cities across the globe, and already woven into the fabric of modern urban planning. This paper studies a practical yet important problem in those systems: how to deploy and manage their infrastructure across space and time, so that the services are ubiquitous to the users while sustainable in profitability. However, in real-world systems evaluating the performance of different deployment strategies and then finding the optimal plan is prohibitively expensive, as it is often infeasible to conduct many iterations of trial-and-error. We tackle this by designing a high-fidelity simulation environment, which abstracts the key operation details of the shared e-mobility systems at fine-granularity, and is calibrated using data collected from the real-world. This allows us to try out arbitrary deployment plans to learn the optimal given specific context, before actually implementing any in the real-world systems. In particular, we propose a novel multi-agent neural search approach, in which we design a hierarchical controller to produce tentative deployment plans. The generated deployment plans are then tested using a multi-simulation paradigm, i.e., evaluated in parallel, where the results are used to train the controller with deep reinforcement learning. With this closed loop, the controller can be steered to have higher probability of generating better deployment plans in future iterations. The proposed approach has been evaluated extensively in our simulation environment, and experimental results show that it outperforms baselines e.g., human knowledge, and state-of-the-art heuristic-based optimization approaches in both service coverage and net revenue.",

    "published_date": "2019-09-30",
    "abstract": "We consider finite and infinite horizon dynamic programming problems, where the control at each stage consists of several distinct decisions, each one made by one of several agents. We introduce an approach, whereby at every stage, each agent's decision is made by executing a local rollout algorithm that uses a base policy, together with some coordinating information from the other agents. The amount of local computation required at every stage by each agent is independent of the number of agents, while the amount of total computation (over all agents) grows linearly with the number of agents. By contrast, with the standard rollout algorithm, the amount of total computation grows exponentially with the number of agents. Despite the drastic reduction in required computation, we show that our algorithm has the fundamental cost improvement property of rollout: an improved performance relative to the base policy. We also discuss possibilities to improve further the method's computational efficiency through limited agent coordination and parallelization of the agents' computations. Finally, we explore related approximate policy iteration algorithms for infinite horizon problems, and we prove that the cost improvement property steers the algorithm towards convergence to an agent-by-agent optimal policy.",

    "title": "Rolling Optimization of Mobile Energy Storage Fleets for Resilient Service Restoration",
    "published_date": "2019-05-16",
    "abstract": "Mobile energy storage systems (MESSs) provide promising solutions to enhance distribution system resilience in terms of mobility and flexibility. This paper proposes a rolling integrated service restoration strategy to minimize the total system cost by coordinating the scheduling of MESS fleets, resource dispatching of microgrids, and network reconfiguration of distribution systems. The integrated strategy takes into account damage and repair to both the roads in transportation networks and the branches in distribution systems. The uncertainties in load consumption and the status of roads and branches are modeled as scenario trees using Monte Carlo simulation method. The operation strategy of MESSs is modeled by a stochastic multi-layer time-space network technique. A rolling optimization framework is adopted to dynamically update system damage, and the coordinated scheduling at each time interval over the prediction horizon is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear program with temporal–spatial and operation constraints. The proposed model is verified on two integrated test systems, one is with Sioux Falls transportation network and four 33-bus distribution systems, and the other is the Singapore transportation network-based test system connecting six 33-bus distribution systems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of MESS mobility to enhance distribution system resilience due to the coordination of mobile and stationary resources.",
