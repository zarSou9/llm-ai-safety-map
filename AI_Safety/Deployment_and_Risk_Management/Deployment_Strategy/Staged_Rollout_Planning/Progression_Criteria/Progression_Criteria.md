### Mini Description

Frameworks for determining when systems are ready to advance to subsequent deployment stages, including quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods.

### Description

Progression Criteria focuses on developing robust frameworks and methodologies for evaluating when AI systems are ready to advance to subsequent deployment stages. This involves establishing quantifiable metrics, qualitative assessment protocols, and decision-making frameworks that can reliably determine whether a system has demonstrated sufficient safety, reliability, and performance in its current deployment stage to justify expansion of its operational scope or capabilities.

Current research explores methods for defining and measuring key performance indicators across multiple dimensions, including technical performance, safety compliance, user interaction quality, and system reliability. Researchers are developing approaches for aggregating and weighing different types of evidence, from quantitative metrics to qualitative assessments, to make informed progression decisions. This includes work on statistical frameworks for evaluating performance stability, methods for assessing the comprehensiveness of testing coverage, and techniques for validating system behavior under various operational conditions.

Significant challenges remain in determining appropriate thresholds for progression, especially given the complex interplay between different performance metrics and safety requirements. Open questions include how to account for rare but significant failure modes, how to evaluate system behavior in previously unseen scenarios, and how to balance the desire for rapid deployment against the need for thorough validation. Researchers are particularly interested in developing methods that can provide strong statistical guarantees about system behavior while remaining practical for real-world deployment scenarios.
