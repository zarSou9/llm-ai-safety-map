### Mini Description

Methods for defining and constraining system capabilities within each deployment stage, including techniques for gradual capability expansion and safety-preserving restrictions.

### Description

Capability Boundaries focuses on methods and frameworks for precisely defining and controlling what AI systems can and cannot do within each deployment stage. This involves developing formal specifications for system capabilities, implementing technical mechanisms to enforce these boundaries, and creating validation approaches to ensure boundaries remain intact. The goal is to allow meaningful testing and validation while maintaining strict control over potential risks.

Current research explores various approaches to capability control, from architectural constraints and input/output restrictions to formal verification of behavioral limits. Key areas include developing methods for gradual capability expansion that preserve safety properties, techniques for detecting and preventing capability generalization beyond intended bounds, and frameworks for formally specifying capability restrictions that remain robust under system learning or adaptation.

Significant challenges include defining capabilities in ways that are both precise and meaningful, preventing unexpected capability emergence through novel combinations of permitted actions, and managing the tension between capability restrictions and system utility. Open questions remain about how to verify capability boundaries in complex systems, how to handle capabilities that exist on a spectrum rather than as discrete functions, and how to maintain reliable boundaries in systems with learning or self-improvement capabilities.
