### Mini Description

Approaches for developing quantitative and qualitative metrics to evaluate system performance and safety at each stage, ensuring meaningful validation while maintaining statistical significance.

### Description

Success Metrics Design focuses on developing comprehensive frameworks for measuring and evaluating AI system performance and safety during staged deployment. This involves creating quantifiable indicators that can effectively assess both the technical capabilities and safety characteristics of systems while providing statistically meaningful results within the constraints of each deployment stage. The metrics must balance the need for rigorous validation against practical limitations of data collection and analysis in restricted deployment environments.

Current research explores methods for designing metrics that can detect both expected and unexpected behaviors, including approaches for measuring system reliability, stability, and alignment with intended objectives. This includes developing techniques for combining multiple measurement types, establishing appropriate baseline comparisons, and ensuring metrics remain meaningful as deployment contexts evolve. Researchers are particularly focused on creating metrics that can provide early warning signals of potential issues while minimizing false positives and negatives.

Key challenges include determining appropriate statistical power requirements for different types of metrics, handling the inherent uncertainty in real-world deployments, and developing metrics that remain relevant across different deployment stages and contexts. Open questions remain about how to effectively measure emergent behaviors, how to validate metrics themselves, and how to design metrics that can meaningfully assess increasingly complex AI systems with potential for unexpected capabilities or behaviors.
