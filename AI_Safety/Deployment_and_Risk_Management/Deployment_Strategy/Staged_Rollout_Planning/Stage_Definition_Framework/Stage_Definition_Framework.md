### Mini Description

Methodologies for designing deployment stages, including criteria for scope, constraints, and success metrics for each phase.

### Description

Stage Definition Framework focuses on developing systematic methodologies for designing and structuring the distinct phases of AI system deployment. This includes establishing clear boundaries and characteristics for each deployment stage, defining the scope of system capabilities and operational constraints, and creating measurable success metrics. The framework must balance the need for meaningful real-world validation against safety considerations while ensuring each stage builds logically toward full deployment.

Current research explores approaches for decomposing deployment into optimal stage sequences, including methods for determining appropriate capability restrictions, environmental constraints, and user interaction limitations for each phase. Researchers are particularly interested in developing frameworks that can adapt to different types of AI systems and deployment contexts while maintaining robust safety guarantees. This includes investigating how to structure stages to maximize learning value and system validation while minimizing potential risks.

Key challenges include determining the optimal granularity of stages, establishing appropriate safety boundaries that don't overly restrict system functionality, and designing stages that provide sufficient statistical power for validation while maintaining practical feasibility. Open questions remain about how to best structure stages for systems with learning capabilities, how to account for emergent behaviors in stage design, and how to develop frameworks that remain effective as AI systems become more complex and capable.
