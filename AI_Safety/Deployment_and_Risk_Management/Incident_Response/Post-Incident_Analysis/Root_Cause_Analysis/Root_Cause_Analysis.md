### Mini Description

Frameworks and methodologies for identifying underlying causes of incidents, including both immediate technical factors and broader systemic issues in design, deployment, or operational processes.

### Description

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in AI safety focuses on systematically identifying and understanding the fundamental causes that led to an AI system incident or failure. Unlike traditional RCA in other domains, AI systems present unique challenges due to their complex architectures, potential emergent behaviors, and the interaction between multiple components including training data, model architecture, deployment environment, and human factors.

A key challenge in AI RCA is the need to distinguish between proximate causes (immediate technical failures) and ultimate causes (deeper systemic issues in design, training, or operational practices). This requires specialized methodologies that can handle the non-linear nature of AI systems, where small changes in initial conditions or seemingly minor design decisions can lead to significant downstream effects. Researchers are developing new frameworks that combine traditional cause-and-effect analysis with AI-specific considerations such as training dynamics, optimization objectives, and emergent properties.

Current research focuses on developing more rigorous and systematic approaches to AI RCA, including formal methods for causal analysis in machine learning systems, techniques for analyzing the interaction between different system components, and frameworks for identifying contributing factors across the entire AI development and deployment pipeline. There is particular emphasis on methods that can handle the uncertainty and probabilistic nature of AI systems while producing actionable insights for improvement.
