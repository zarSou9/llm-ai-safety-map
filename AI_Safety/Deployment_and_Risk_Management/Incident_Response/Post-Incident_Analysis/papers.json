    "published_date": "2024-02-15",
    "abstract": "Incident management for large cloud services is a complex and tedious process and requires significant amount of manual efforts from on-call engineers (OCEs). OCEs typically leverage data from different stages of the software development lifecycle [SDLC] (e.g., codes, configuration, monitor data, service properties, service dependencies, trouble-shooting documents, etc.) to generate insights for detection, root causing and mitigating of incidents. Recent advancements in large language models [LLMs] (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4, Gemini) created opportunities to automatically generate contextual recommendations to the OCEs assisting them to quickly identify and mitigate critical issues. However, existing research typically takes a silo-ed view for solving a certain task in incident management by leveraging data from a single stage of SDLC. In this paper, we demonstrate that augmenting additional contextual data from different stages of SDLC improves the performance of two critically important and practically challenging tasks: (1) automatically generating root cause recommendations for dependency failure related incidents, and (2) identifying ontology of service monitors used for automatically detecting incidents. By leveraging 353 incident and 260 monitor dataset from Microsoft, we demonstrate that augmenting contextual information from different stages of the SDLC improves the performance over State-of-The-Art methods.",

    "title": "Automated Root Causing of Cloud Incidents using In-Context Learning with GPT-4",
    "published_date": "2024-01-24",
    "abstract": "Root Cause Analysis (RCA) plays a pivotal role in the incident diagnosis process for cloud services, requiring on-call engineers to identify the primary issues and implement corrective actions to prevent future recurrences. Improving the incident RCA process is vital for minimizing service downtime, customer impact and manual toil. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have introduced state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, which have proven effective in tackling various AIOps problems, ranging from code authoring to incident management. Nonetheless, the GPT-4 model's immense size presents challenges when trying to fine-tune it on user data because of the significant GPU resource demand and the necessity for continuous model fine-tuning with the emergence of new data. To address the high cost of fine-tuning LLM, we propose an in-context learning approach for automated root causing, which eliminates the need for fine-tuning. We conduct extensive study over 100,000 production incidents, comparing several large language models using multiple metrics. The results reveal that our in-context learning approach outperforms the previous fine-tuned large language models such as GPT-3 by an average of 24.8\\% across all metrics, with an impressive 49.7\\% improvement over the zero-shot model. Moreover, human evaluation involving actual incident owners demonstrates its superiority over the fine-tuned model, achieving a 43.5\\% improvement in correctness and an 8.7\\% enhancement in readability. The impressive results demonstrate the viability of utilizing a vanilla GPT model for the RCA task, thereby avoiding the high computational and maintenance costs associated with a fine-tuned model.",

    "title": "Learning From Lessons Learned: Preliminary Findings From a Study of Learning From Failure",
    "published_date": "2024-02-14",
    "abstract": "Due to various sources of uncertainty, emergent behavior, and ongoing changes, the reliability of many socio-technical systems depends on an iterative and collaborative process in which organizations (1) analyze and learn from system failures, and then (2) co-evolve both the technical and human parts of their systems based on what they learn. Many organizations have defined processes for learning from failure, often involving postmortem analyses conducted after any system failures that are judged to be sufficiently severe. Despite established processes and tool support, our preliminary research, and professional experience, suggest that it is not straightforward to take what was learned from a failure and successfully improve the reliability of the socio-technical system. To better understand this collaborative process and the associated challenges, we are conducting a study of how teams learn from failure. We are gathering incident reports from multiple organizations and conducting interviews with engineers and managers with relevant experience Our analytic interest is in what is learned by teams as they reflect on failures, the learning processes involved, and how they use what is learned. Our data collection and analysis are not yet complete, but we have so far analyzed 13 incident reports and seven interviews In this short paper we (1) present our preliminary findings, and (2) outline our broader research plans.",

    "title": "Exploring LLM-based Agents for Root Cause Analysis",
    "published_date": "2024-03-07",
    "abstract": "The growing complexity of cloud based software systems has resulted in incident management becoming an integral part of the software development lifecycle. Root cause analysis (RCA), a critical part of the incident management process, is a demanding task for on-call engineers, requiring deep domain knowledge and extensive experience with a team's specific services. Automation of RCA can result in significant savings of time, and ease the burden of incident management on on-call engineers. Recently, researchers have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform RCA, and have demonstrated promising results. However, these approaches are not able to dynamically collect additional diagnostic information such as incident related logs, metrics or databases, severely restricting their ability to diagnose root causes. In this work, we explore the use of LLM based agents for RCA to address this limitation. We present a thorough empirical evaluation of a ReAct agent equipped with retrieval tools, on an out-of-distribution dataset of production incidents collected at Microsoft. Results show that ReAct performs competitively with strong retrieval and reasoning baselines, but with highly increased factual accuracy. We then extend this evaluation by incorporating discussions associated with incident reports as additional inputs for the models, which surprisingly does not yield significant performance improvements. Lastly, we conduct a case study with a team at Microsoft to equip the ReAct agent with tools that give it access to external diagnostic services that are used by the team for manual RCA. Our results show how agents can overcome the limitations of prior work, and practical considerations for implementing such a system in practice.",

    "published_date": "2022-11-15",
    "abstract": "Safe and secure electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are important in smart transportation infrastructure. The prevalence of EVCSs has rapidly increased over time in response to the rising demand for EV charging. However, developments in information and communication technologies (ICT) have made the cyber-physical system (CPS) of EVCSs susceptible to cyber-attacks, which might destabilize the infrastructure of the electric grid as well as the environment for charging. This study suggests a 5Ws & 1H-based investigation approach to deal with cyber-attack-related incidents due to the incapacity of the current investigation frameworks to comprehend and handle these mishaps. Also, a stochastic anomaly detection system (ADS) is proposed to identify the anomalies, abnormal activities, and unusual operations of the station entities as a post cyber event analysis.",

    "title": "Mining Root Cause Knowledge from Cloud Service Incident Investigations for AIOps",
    "published_date": "2022-04-21",
    "abstract": "Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of any service-disrupting incident is one of the most critical as well as complex tasks in IT processes, especially for cloud industry leaders like Salesforce. Typically RCA investigation leverages data-sources like application error logs or service call traces. However a rich goldmine of root cause information is also hidden in the natural language documentation of the past incidents investigations by domain experts. This is generally termed as Problem Review Board (PRB) Data which constitute a core component of IT Incident Management. However, owing to the raw unstructured nature of PRBs, such root cause knowledge is not directly reusable by manual or automated pipelines for RCA of new incidents. This motivates us to leverage this widely-available data-source to build an Incident Causation Analysis (ICA) engine, using SoTA neural NLP techniques to extract targeted information and construct a structured Causal Knowledge Graph from PRB documents. ICA forms the backbone of a simple-yet-effective Retrieval based RCA for new incidents, through an Information Retrieval system to search and rank past incidents and detect likely root causes from them, given the incident symptom. In this work, we present ICA and the downstream Incident Search and Retrieval based RCA pipeline, built at Salesforce, over 2K documented cloud service incident investigations collected over a few years. We also establish the effectiveness of ICA and the downstream tasks through various quantitative benchmarks, qualitative analysis as well as domain expert's validation and real incident case studies after deployment.",
