### Mini Description

Methods and frameworks for gathering, structuring, and normalizing incident data to enable meaningful cross-incident comparison and analysis.

### Description

Data Collection and Standardization in AI incident analysis focuses on establishing systematic approaches for gathering, documenting, and normalizing information about AI safety incidents. This includes developing standardized formats and protocols for capturing both technical data (system states, logs, performance metrics) and contextual information (environmental conditions, human interactions, organizational factors). The challenge lies in creating collection frameworks that are both comprehensive enough to capture the complexity of AI incidents and flexible enough to accommodate novel types of failures or unexpected behaviors.

A key aspect is the development of data quality standards and validation procedures to ensure collected information is accurate, complete, and useful for analysis. This involves establishing clear definitions for different types of incidents and their attributes, creating verification processes for submitted data, and developing methods to handle missing or uncertain information. Researchers must also address challenges related to data privacy, intellectual property concerns, and potential conflicts between transparency and competitive interests.

Current research particularly focuses on creating interoperable data formats and shared vocabularies that enable effective information sharing across organizations and domains. This includes work on automated data collection tools, standardized incident reporting templates, and mechanisms for securely aggregating sensitive incident data. There is growing emphasis on developing approaches that can capture not just what went wrong, but also the broader context of system deployment, including successful interventions and near-misses that can provide valuable insights for safety improvement.
