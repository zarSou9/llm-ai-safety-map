### Mini Description

Methods and tools for capturing, storing, and maintaining the integrity of system logs, states, and environmental data relevant to an incident, including approaches for handling high-volume, high-velocity data streams.

### Description

Data Collection and Preservation in AI safety incident investigation focuses on systematically capturing, storing, and maintaining the integrity of all relevant information when AI systems experience failures or unexpected behaviors. This encompasses both real-time data collection during normal operation and specialized capture mechanisms that activate during incidents. The challenge lies in determining what data is relevant, managing the massive volume and velocity of information generated by AI systems, and ensuring that critical information is not lost during system failures.

A key technical challenge is developing efficient storage and indexing systems that can handle the diverse types of data needed for incident investigation, including system logs, model states, input-output pairs, environmental conditions, and performance metrics. This requires careful consideration of sampling rates, compression techniques, and storage hierarchies to balance completeness with practical constraints. Researchers must also address challenges related to data integrity, including methods for cryptographic verification and maintaining clear chains of custody.

Current research focuses on developing adaptive collection systems that can automatically adjust their behavior based on detected anomalies, increasing data granularity when potential incidents are identified. There is particular emphasis on creating robust backup mechanisms that can preserve critical information even during catastrophic failures, as well as developing standardized formats and protocols for incident data that facilitate analysis while ensuring privacy and security requirements are met.
