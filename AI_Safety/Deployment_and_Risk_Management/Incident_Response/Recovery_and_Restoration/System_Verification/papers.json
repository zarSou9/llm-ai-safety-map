    "title": "Using Formal Verification to Evaluate Single Event Upsets in a RISC-V Core",
    "published_date": "2024-05-20",
    "abstract": "Reliability has been a major concern in embedded systems. Higher transistor density and lower voltage supply increase the vulnerability of embedded systems to soft errors. A Single Event Upset (SEU), which is also called a soft error, can reverse a bit in a sequential element, resulting in a system failure. Simulation-based fault injection has been widely used to evaluate reliability, as suggested by ISO26262. However, it is practically impossible to test all faults for a complex design. Random fault injection is a compromise that reduces accuracy and fault coverage. Formal verification is an alternative approach. In this paper, we use formal verification, in the form of model checking, to evaluate the hardware reliability of a RISC-V Ibex Core in the presence of soft errors. Backward tracing is performed to identify and categorize faults according to their effects (no effect, Silent Data Corruption, crashes, and hangs). By using formal verification, the entire state space and fault list can be exhaustively explored. It is found that misaligned instructions can amplify fault effects. It is also found that some bits are more vulnerable to SEUs than others. In general, most of the bits in the Ibex Core are vulnerable to Silent Data Corruption, and the second pipeline stage is more vulnerable to Silent Data Corruption than the first.",

    "title": "Formal Verification of Digital Twins with TLA and Information Leakage Control",
    "published_date": "2024-11-27",
    "abstract": "Verifying the correctness of a digital twin provides a formal guarantee that the digital twin operates as intended. Digital twin verification is challenging due to the presence of uncertainties in the virtual representation, the physical environment, and the bidirectional flow of information between physical and virtual. A further challenge is that a digital twin of a complex system is composed of distributed components. This paper presents a methodology to specify and verify digital twin behavior, translating uncertain processes into a formally verifiable finite state machine. We use the Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) to create a specification, an implementation abstraction that defines the properties required for correct system behavior. Our approach includes a novel weakening of formal security properties, allowing controlled information leakage while preserving theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate this approach on a digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle, verifying synchronization of physical-to-virtual and virtual-to-digital data flows to detect unintended misalignments.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a TLA-based methodology for formally verifying digital twin behavior, addressing challenges posed by uncertainties and distributed components, and incorporating a novel approach to controlled information leakage for enhanced security. The method is demonstrated through verification of data synchronization in a UAV digital twin."

    "title": "Lessons from Formally Verified Deployed Software Systems (Extended version)",
    "published_date": "2023-01-05",
    "abstract": "The technology of formal software verification has made spectacular advances, but how much does it actually benefit the development of practical software? Considerable disagreement remains about the practicality of building systems with mechanically-checked proofs of correctness. Is this prospect confined to a few expensive, life-critical projects, or can the idea be applied to a wide segment of the software industry? To help answer this question, the present survey examines a range of projects, in various application areas, that have produced formally verified systems and deployed them for actual use. It considers the technologies used, the form of verification applied, the results obtained, and the lessons that the software industry should draw regarding its ability to benefit from formal verification techniques and tools. Note: this version is the extended article, covering all the systems identified as relevant. A shorter version, covering only a selection, is also available.",
    "summary": "This paper surveys deployed formally verified software systems across various application domains, analyzing the employed technologies, verification methods, achieved results, and drawing lessons for broader software industry adoption of formal verification. It aims to assess the practicality and scalability of formal verification beyond niche applications."

    "title": "Neural Network Verification using Residual Reasoning",
    "published_date": "2022-08-05",
    "abstract": "With the increasing integration of neural networks as components in mission-critical systems, there is an increasing need to ensure that they satisfy various safety and liveness requirements. In recent years, numerous sound and complete verification methods have been proposed towards that end, but these typically suffer from severe scalability limitations. Recent work has proposed enhancing such verification techniques with abstraction-refinement capabilities, which have been shown to boost scalability: instead of verifying a large and complex network, the verifier constructs and then verifies a much smaller network, whose correctness implies the correctness of the original network. A shortcoming of such a scheme is that if verifying the smaller network fails, the verifier needs to perform a refinement step that increases the size of the network being verified, and then start verifying the new network from scratch - effectively\"wasting\"its earlier work on verifying the smaller network. In this paper, we present an enhancement to abstraction-based verification of neural networks, by using residual reasoning: the process of utilizing information acquired when verifying an abstract network, in order to expedite the verification of a refined network. In essence, the method allows the verifier to store information about parts of the search space in which the refined network is guaranteed to behave correctly, and allows it to focus on areas where bugs might be discovered. We implemented our approach as an extension to the Marabou verifier, and obtained promising results.",

    "abstract": "In this short paper, we present our ongoing work on the veriFIRE project -- a collaboration between industry and academia, aimed at using verification for increasing the reliability of a real-world, safety-critical system. The system we target is an airborne platform for wildfire detection, which incorporates two deep neural networks. We describe the system and its properties of interest, and discuss our attempts to verify the system's consistency, i.e., its ability to continue and correctly classify a given input, even if the wildfire it describes increases in intensity. We regard this work as a step towards the incorporation of academic-oriented verification tools into real-world systems of interest.",

    "title": "Verilay: A Verifiable Proof of Stake Chain Relay",
    "published_date": "2022-01-21",
    "abstract": "Blockchain relay schemes enable cross-chain state proofs without requiring trusted intermediaries. This is achieved by applying the source blockchain's consensus validation protocol on the target blockchain. Existing chain relays allow for the validation of blocks created using the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol. Since PoW entails high energy consumption, limited throughput, and no guaranteed finality, Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols are increasingly popular for addressing these shortcomings. We propose Verilay, the first chain relay scheme that enables validating PoS protocols that produce finalized blocks, for example, Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos, and Polkadot. The concept does not require changes to the source blockchain protocols or validator operations. Signatures of block proposers are validated by a dedicated relay smart contract on the target blockchain. In contrast to basic PoW chain relays, Verilay requires only a subset of block headers to be submitted in order to maintain full verifiability. This yields enhanced scalability. We provide a prototypical implementation that facilitates the validation of Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain headers within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Our evaluation proves the applicability to Ethereum 1.0's mainnet and confirms that only a fraction of transaction costs are required compared to PoW chain relay updates.",
    "citation_count": 15,
    "summary": "Verilay is the first chain relay scheme to verifiably relay finalized Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain blocks, like those from Ethereum 2.0, without modifying source chain protocols, achieving scalability by only relaying a subset of block headers. This allows for cross-chain state proofs without trusted intermediaries, significantly improving upon the limitations of existing Proof-of-Work (PoW) based relays."

    "title": "Verifiable Failure Localization in Smart Grid under Cyber-Physical Attacks",
    "published_date": "2021-01-18",
    "abstract": "Cyber-physical attacks impose a significant threat to the smart grid, as the cyber attack makes it difficult to identify the actual damage caused by the physical attack. To defend against such attacks, various inference-based solutions have been proposed to estimate the states of grid elements (e.g., transmission lines) from measurements outside the attacked area, out of which a few have provided theoretical conditions for guaranteed accuracy. However, these conditions are usually based on the ground truth states and thus not verifiable in practice. To solve this problem, we develop (i) verifiable conditions that can be tested based on only observable information, and (ii) efficient algorithms for verifying the states of links (i.e., transmission lines) within the attacked area based on these conditions. Our numerical evaluations based on the Polish power grid and IEEE 300-bus system demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are highly successful in verifying the states of truly failed links, and can thus greatly help in prioritizing repairs during the recovery process.",
    "summary": "This paper presents verifiable conditions and efficient algorithms for locating failed transmission lines in smart grids under cyber-physical attacks, using only observable data to improve the accuracy of state estimation and facilitate repair prioritization. Numerical evaluations on real-world power grid models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
