    "title": "Integrating Graceful Degradation and Recovery Through Requirement-Driven Adaptation",
    "published_date": "2024-01-18",
    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to environmental uncertainties such as adverse operating conditions, malicious attacks, and hardware degradation. These uncertainties may lead to failures that put the system in a sub-optimal or unsafe state. Systems that are resilient to such uncertainties rely on two types of operations: (1) graceful degradation, for ensuring that the system maintains an acceptable level of safety during unexpected environmental conditions and (2) recovery, to facilitate the resumption of normal system functions. Typically, mechanisms for degradation and recovery are developed independently from each other, and later integrated into a system, requiring the designer to develop an additional, ad-hoc logic for activating and coordinating between the two operations. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptation approach for improving system resiliency through automated triggering and coordination of graceful degradation and recovery. The key idea behind our approach is to treat degradation and recovery as requirement-driven adaptation tasks: Degradation can be thought of as temporarily weakening original (i.e., ideal) system requirements to be achieved by the system, and recovery as strengthening the weakened requirements when the environment returns within an expected operating boundary. Furthermore, by treating weakening and strengthening as dual operations, we argue that a single requirement-based adaptation method is sufficient to enable coordination between degradation and recovery. Given system requirements specified in signal temporal logic (STL), we propose a run-time adaptation framework that performs degradation and recovery in response to environmental changes. We describe a prototype implementation of our framework and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach using a case study in unmanned underwater vehicles.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a self-adaptation approach for improving cyber-physical system resilience by treating graceful degradation and recovery as dual, requirement-driven adaptation tasks, automating their coordination through a signal temporal logic (STL)-based runtime framework. The approach uses a single adaptation method for both, eliminating the need for ad-hoc integration logic."

    "title": "Rapid Recovery of Program Execution Under Power Failures for Embedded Systems with NVM",
    "published_date": "2022-09-19",
    "abstract": "After power is switched on, recovering the interrupted program from the initial state can cause negative impact. Some programs are even unrecoverable. To rapid recovery of program execution under power failures, the execution states of checkpoints are backed up by NVM under power failures for embedded systems with NVM. However, frequent checkpoints will shorten the lifetime of the NVM and incur significant write overhead. In this paper, the technique of checkpoint setting triggered by function calls is proposed to reduce the write on NVM. The evaluation results show an average of 99.8% and 80.5$% reduction on NVM backup size for stack backup, compared to the log-based method and step-based method. In order to better achieve this, we also propose pseudo-function calls to increase backup points to reduce recovery costs, and exponential incremental call-based backup methods to reduce backup costs in the loop. To further avoid the content on NVM is cluttered and out of NVM, a method to clean the contents on the NVM that are useless for restoration is proposed. Based on aforementioned problems and techniques, the recovery technology is proposed, and the case is used to analyze how to recover rapidly under different power failures.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a novel checkpointing mechanism for embedded systems using non-volatile memory (NVM) to enable rapid program recovery after power failures, minimizing NVM writes by strategically placing checkpoints based on function calls and employing techniques to optimize backup size and NVM usage. The proposed method significantly reduces NVM storage needs compared to existing approaches."

    "title": "Talking After Lights Out: An Ad Hoc Network for Electric Grid Recovery",
    "published_date": "2021-02-11",
    "abstract": "When the electrical grid in a region suffers a major outage, e.g., after a catastrophic cyber attack, a “black start” may be required, where the grid is slowly restarted, carefully and incrementally adding generating capacity and demand. To ensure safe and effective black start, the grid control center has to be able to communicate with field personnel and with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Voice and text communication are particularly critical. As part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation, and Characterization Systems (RADICS) program, we designed, tested and evaluated a self-configuring mesh network prototype called the Phoenix Secure Emergency Network (PhoenixSEN). PhoenixSEN provides a secure drop-in replacement for grid's primary communication networks during black start recovery. The network combines existing and new technologies, can work with a variety of link-layer protocols, emphasizes manageability and auto-configuration, and provides services and applications for coordination of people and devices including voice, text, and SCADA communication. We discuss the architecture of PhoenixSEN and evaluate a prototype on realistic grid infrastructure through a series of DARPA-led exercises.",
    "summary": "PhoenixSEN, a self-configuring mesh network, provides secure communication for electric grid recovery during black start events, enabling voice, text, and SCADA communication even when primary networks are unavailable. Its design and performance were evaluated through realistic DARPA exercises."

    "title": "IS incident recovery and service value: a service-dominant logic view",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT IS service delivery failures inside companies are value diminishing events. Information systems service providers seek to limit this value destruction but lack guidance on IS incident resolution actions that satisfy users and preserve IS service value. We apply Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) to explore what is relevant to users' recovery service experiences while interacting with IS service providers. We use an integrated research approach including qualitative and quantitative data. We uncover actions that lead to a satisfying incident recovery and categorise them into three recovery components (responsive handling interactions, supportive communicating interactions, and effective resolving actions) that reflect IS provider resource exchanges of information, knowledge, and service skills with users in resolving incidents. We integrate these three recovery components as factors in our research model and test direct and moderating effects on value outcomes. We find that users' recovery satisfaction results from both a “fix it fast and fully” perspective and a sense of effort and fairness conveyed. Results point to managers preserving overall IS service satisfaction and service quality by facilitating proper resource exchanges during an incident recovery.",

    "published_date": "2021-11-19",
    "abstract": "Enhancing restoration capabilities of distribution systems is one of the main strategies for resilient power systems to cope with extreme events. However, most of the existing studies assume the communication infrastructures are intact for distribution automation, which is unrealistic. Motivated by the applications of the emergency communication vehicles (ECVs) in quickly setting up wireless communication networks after disasters, in this paper, we propose an integrated distribution system restoration (DSR) framework and optimization models, which can coordinate the repair crews, the distribution system (physical sectors), and the emergency communication (cyber sectors) to pick up unserved power loads as quickly as possible. Case studies validated the effectiveness of the proposed models and proved the benefit of considering ECVs and cyber-physical interdependencies in DSR.",

    "title": "Real-Time Predictive Maintenance using Autoencoder Reconstruction and Anomaly Detection",
    "published_date": "2021-10-01",
    "abstract": "Rotary machine breakdown detection systems are outdated and dependent upon routine testing to discover faults. This is costly and often reactive in nature. Real-time monitoring offers a solution for detecting faults without the need for manual observation. However, manual interpretation for threshold anomaly detection is often subjective and varies between industrial experts. This approach is ridged and prone to a large number of false positives. To address this issue, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) approach to model normal working operation and detect anomalies. The approach extracts key features from signals representing known normal operation to model machine behaviour and automatically identify anomalies. The ML learns generalisations and generates thresholds based on fault severity. This provides engineers with a traffic light system were green is normal behaviour, amber is worrying and red signifies a machine fault. This scale allows engineers to undertake early intervention measures at the appropriate time. The approach is evaluated on windowed real machine sensor data to observe normal and abnormal behaviour. The results demonstrate that it is possible to detect anomalies within the amber range and raise alarms before machine failure.",

    "title": "Resilience-Motivated Distribution System Restoration Considering Electricity-Water-Gas Interdependency",
    "published_date": "2021-11-01",
    "abstract": "A major outage in the electricity distribution system may affect the operation of water and natural gas supply systems, leading to an interruption of multiple services to critical customers. Therefore, enhancing resilience of critical infrastructures requires joint efforts of multiple sectors. In this paper, a distribution system service restoration method considering the electricity-water-gas interdependency is proposed. The objective is to provide electricity, water, and natural gas supplies to critical customers in the desired ratio according to their needs after an extreme event. The operational constraints of electricity, water, and natural gas networks are considered. The characteristics of electricity-driven coupling components, including water pumps and gas compressors, are also modeled. Relaxation techniques are applied to nonconvex constraints posed by physical laws of those networks. Consequently, the restoration problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone program, which can readily be solved by the off-the-shelf solvers. The proposed method is validated by numerical simulations on electricity-water-gas integrated systems, developed based on benchmark models of the subsystems. The results indicate that considering the interdependency refines the allocation of limited generation resources and demonstrate the exactness of the proposed convex relaxation.",

    "title": "Graph-based Incident Aggregation for Large-Scale Online Service Systems",
    "published_date": "2021-08-27",
    "abstract": "As online service systems continue to grow in terms of complexity and volume, how service incidents are managed will significantly impact company revenue and user trust. Due to the cascading effect, cloud failures often come with an overwhelming number of incidents from dependent services and devices. To pursue efficient incident management, related incidents should be quickly aggregated to narrow down the problem scope. To this end, in this paper, we propose GRLIA, an incident aggregation framework based on graph representation learning over the cascading graph of cloud failures. A representation vector is learned for each unique type of incident in an unsupervised and unified manner, which is able to simultaneously encode the topological and temporal correlations among incidents. Thus, it can be easily employed for online incident aggregation. In particular, to learn the correlations more accurately, we try to recover the complete scope of failures' cascading impact by leveraging fine-grained system monitoring data, i.e., Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The proposed framework is evaluated with real-world incident data collected from a large-scale online service system of Huawei Cloud. The experimental results demonstrate that GRLIA is effective and outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, our framework has been successfully deployed in industrial practice.",
