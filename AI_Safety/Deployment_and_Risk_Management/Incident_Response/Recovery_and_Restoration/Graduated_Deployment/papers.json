    "title": "Integrating Graceful Degradation and Recovery Through Requirement-Driven Adaptation",
    "published_date": "2024-01-18",
    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to environmental uncertainties such as adverse operating conditions, malicious attacks, and hardware degradation. These uncertainties may lead to failures that put the system in a sub-optimal or unsafe state. Systems that are resilient to such uncertainties rely on two types of operations: (1) graceful degradation, for ensuring that the system maintains an acceptable level of safety during unexpected environmental conditions and (2) recovery, to facilitate the resumption of normal system functions. Typically, mechanisms for degradation and recovery are developed independently from each other, and later integrated into a system, requiring the designer to develop an additional, ad-hoc logic for activating and coordinating between the two operations. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptation approach for improving system resiliency through automated triggering and coordination of graceful degradation and recovery. The key idea behind our approach is to treat degradation and recovery as requirement-driven adaptation tasks: Degradation can be thought of as temporarily weakening original (i.e., ideal) system requirements to be achieved by the system, and recovery as strengthening the weakened requirements when the environment returns within an expected operating boundary. Furthermore, by treating weakening and strengthening as dual operations, we argue that a single requirement-based adaptation method is sufficient to enable coordination between degradation and recovery. Given system requirements specified in signal temporal logic (STL), we propose a run-time adaptation framework that performs degradation and recovery in response to environmental changes. We describe a prototype implementation of our framework and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach using a case study in unmanned underwater vehicles.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a novel self-adaptation approach for improving the resilience of cyber-physical systems by integrating graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms through requirement-driven adaptation using signal temporal logic (STL), automating their coordination and triggering. The approach treats degradation and recovery as dual operations on system requirements, enabling a unified adaptation framework."

    "title": "Reliability Analysis of Gracefully Degrading Automotive Systems",
    "published_date": "2023-05-12",
    "abstract": "Fail-operational systems are a prerequisite for autonomous driving. Without a driver who can act as a fallback solution in a critical failure scenario, the system has to be able to mitigate failures on its own and keep critical applications operational. To reduce redundancy cost, graceful degradation can be applied by repurposing hardware resources at run-time. Critical applications can be kept operational by starting passive backups and shutting down non-critical applications instead to make sufficient resources available. In order to design such systems efficiently, the degradation effects on reliability and cost savings have to be analyzed. In this paper we present our approach to formally analyze the impact of graceful degradation on the reliability of critical and non-critical applications. We then quantify the effect of graceful degradation on the reliability of both critical and non-critical applications in distributed automotive systems and compare the achieved cost reduction with conventional redundancy approaches. In our experiments redundancy overhead could be reduced by 80% compared to active redundancy in a scenario with a balanced mix of critical and non-critical applications using our graceful degradation approach Overall, we present a detailed reliability and cost analysis of graceful degradation in distributed automotive systems. Our findings confirm that using graceful degradation can tremendously reduce cost compared to conventional redundancy approaches with no negative impact on the redundancy of critical applications if a reliability reduction of non-critical applications can be accepted. Our results show that a trade-off between the impact of the degradation on the reliability of non-critical applications and cost reduction has to be made.",
    "summary": "This paper analyzes the reliability and cost-effectiveness of gracefully degrading automotive systems, demonstrating that repurposing hardware resources during runtime can reduce redundancy costs by up to 80% compared to active redundancy, albeit with potential reliability trade-offs for non-critical applications. The authors present a formal analysis quantifying this trade-off between cost reduction and the impact on the reliability of both critical and non-critical functions."

    "title": "Online Learning for Failure-Aware Edge Backup of Service Function Chains With the Minimum Latency",
    "published_date": "2022-01-18",
    "abstract": "Virtual network functions (VNFs) have been widely deployed in mobile edge computing (MEC) to flexibly and efficiently serve end users running resource-intensive applications, which can be further serialized to form service function chains (SFCs), providing customized networking services. To ensure the availability of SFCs, it turns out to be effective to place redundant SFC backups at the edge for quickly recovering from any failures. The existing research largely overlooks the influences of SFC popularity, backup completeness, and failure rate on the optimal deployment of SFC backups on edge servers. In this paper, we comprehensively consider from the perspectives of both the end users and edge system to backup SFCs for providing popular services with the lowest latency. To overcome the challenges resulted from unknown SFC popularity and failure rate, as well as the known system parameter constraints, we take advantage of the online bandit learning technique to cope with the uncertainty issue. Combining the Prim -inspired method with the greedy strategy, we propose a Real-Time Selection and Deployment (RTSD) algorithm. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms.",

    "title": "Rapid Recovery of Program Execution Under Power Failures for Embedded Systems with NVM",
    "published_date": "2022-09-19",
    "abstract": "After power is switched on, recovering the interrupted program from the initial state can cause negative impact. Some programs are even unrecoverable. To rapid recovery of program execution under power failures, the execution states of checkpoints are backed up by NVM under power failures for embedded systems with NVM. However, frequent checkpoints will shorten the lifetime of the NVM and incur significant write overhead. In this paper, the technique of checkpoint setting triggered by function calls is proposed to reduce the write on NVM. The evaluation results show an average of 99.8% and 80.5$% reduction on NVM backup size for stack backup, compared to the log-based method and step-based method. In order to better achieve this, we also propose pseudo-function calls to increase backup points to reduce recovery costs, and exponential incremental call-based backup methods to reduce backup costs in the loop. To further avoid the content on NVM is cluttered and out of NVM, a method to clean the contents on the NVM that are useless for restoration is proposed. Based on aforementioned problems and techniques, the recovery technology is proposed, and the case is used to analyze how to recover rapidly under different power failures.",

    "published_date": "2021-11-19",
    "abstract": "Enhancing restoration capabilities of distribution systems is one of the main strategies for resilient power systems to cope with extreme events. However, most of the existing studies assume the communication infrastructures are intact for distribution automation, which is unrealistic. Motivated by the applications of the emergency communication vehicles (ECVs) in quickly setting up wireless communication networks after disasters, in this paper, we propose an integrated distribution system restoration (DSR) framework and optimization models, which can coordinate the repair crews, the distribution system (physical sectors), and the emergency communication (cyber sectors) to pick up unserved power loads as quickly as possible. Case studies validated the effectiveness of the proposed models and proved the benefit of considering ECVs and cyber-physical interdependencies in DSR.",

Case studies demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in accelerating load recovery by considering cyber-physical interdependencies."
