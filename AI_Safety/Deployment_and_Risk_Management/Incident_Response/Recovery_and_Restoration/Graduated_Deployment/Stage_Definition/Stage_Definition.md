### Mini Description

Frameworks and methodologies for defining appropriate operational stages, including identification of functionality groupings and establishment of clear boundaries between stages.

### Description

Stage Definition in graduated deployment focuses on establishing clear, distinct operational levels through which an AI system progresses during recovery or initial deployment. This involves analyzing system functionalities, dependencies, and risk factors to create meaningful groupings that allow for controlled testing and validation. The challenge lies in determining how to partition complex system capabilities into coherent stages that balance granularity with practical implementability.

A key consideration is the identification of natural breakpoints in system functionality that align with safety verification requirements. This includes understanding which capabilities can be meaningfully isolated, how different components interact, and what constitutes a stable configuration at each stage. Researchers must consider both technical feasibility and operational requirements when defining stages, ensuring that each level provides useful functionality while maintaining robust safety guarantees.

Current research challenges include developing systematic methodologies for decomposing AI systems into staged deployments, particularly for systems with emergent properties or complex learning capabilities. Open questions focus on how to define stages that accommodate both discrete functional components and continuous learning processes, how to handle capabilities that resist clean decomposition, and how to adapt stage definitions as systems evolve or requirements change.
