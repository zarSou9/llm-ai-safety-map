    "title": "Emergency Response Inference Mapping (ERIMap): A Bayesian Network-based Method for Dynamic Observation Processing in Spatially Distributed Emergencies",
    "published_date": "2024-03-11",
    "abstract": "In emergencies, high stake decisions often have to be made under time pressure and strain. In order to support such decisions, information from various sources needs to be collected and processed rapidly. The information available tends to be temporally and spatially variable, uncertain, and sometimes conflicting, leading to potential biases in decisions. Currently, there is a lack of systematic approaches for information processing and situation assessment which meet the particular demands of emergency situations. To address this gap, we present a Bayesian network-based method called ERIMap that is tailored to the complex information-scape during emergencies. The method enables the systematic and rapid processing of heterogeneous and potentially uncertain observations and draws inferences about key variables of an emergency. It thereby reduces complexity and cognitive load for decision makers. The output of the ERIMap method is a dynamically evolving and spatially resolved map of beliefs about key variables of an emergency that is updated each time a new observation becomes available. The method is illustrated in a case study in which an emergency response is triggered by an accident causing a gas leakage on a chemical plant site.",

    "title": "Emergency Resource Layout with Multiple Objectives under Complex Disaster Scenarios",
    "published_date": "2023-04-14",
    "abstract": "Effective placement of emergency rescue resources, particularly with joint suppliers in complex disaster scenarios, is crucial for ensuring the reliability, efficiency, and quality of emergency rescue activities. However, limited research has considered the interaction between different disasters and material classification, which are highly vital to the emergency rescue. This study provides a novel and practical framework for reliable strategies of emergency rescue under complex disaster scenarios. The study employs a scenario-based approach to represent complex disasters, such as earthquakes, mudslides, floods, and their interactions. In optimizing the placement of emergency resources, the study considers government-owned suppliers, framework agreement suppliers, and existing suppliers collectively supporting emergency rescue materials. To determine the selection of joint suppliers and their corresponding optimal material quantities under complex disaster scenarios, the research proposes a multi-objective model that integrates cost, fairness, emergency efficiency, and uncertainty into a facility location problem. Finally, the study develops an NSGA-II-XGB algorithm to solve a disaster-prone province example and verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective model and solution methods. The results show that the methodology proposed in this paper can greatly reduce emergency costs, rescue time, and the difference between demand and suppliers while maximizing the coverage of rescue resources. More importantly, it can optimize the scale of resources by determining the location and number of materials provided by joint suppliers for various kinds of disasters simultaneously. This research represents a promising step towards making informed configuration decisions in emergency rescue work.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model for efficient emergency resource allocation in complex disaster scenarios, considering multiple supplier types and disaster interactions, solved using an NSGA-II-XGB algorithm to minimize costs, time, and supply-demand discrepancies while maximizing resource coverage. The model improves upon existing methods by incorporating diverse disaster types and supplier partnerships for enhanced emergency response."

    "title": "Decision-making of Emergent Incident based on P-MADDPG",
    "published_date": "2022-03-19",
    "abstract": "In recent years, human casualties and damage to resources caused by emergent incidents have become a serious problem worldwide. In this paper, we model the emergency decision-making problem and use Multi-agent System (MAS) to solve the problem that the decision speed cannot keep up with the spreading speed. MAS can play an important role in the automated execution of these tasks to reduce mission completion time. In this paper, we propose a P-MADDPG algorithm to solve the emergency decision-making problem of emergent incidents, which predicts the nodes where an incident may occur in the next time by GRU model and makes decisions before the incident occurs, thus solving the problem that the decision speed cannot keep up with the spreading speed. A simulation environment was established for realistic scenarios, and three scenarios were selected to test the performance of P-MADDPG in emergency decision-making problems for emergent incidents: unmanned storage, factory assembly line, and civil airport baggage transportation. Simulation results using the P-MADDPG algorithm are compared with the greedy algorithm and the MADDPG algorithm, and the final experimental results show that the P-MADDPG algorithm converges faster and better than the other algorithms in scenarios of different sizes. This shows that the P-MADDP algorithm is effective for emergency decision-making in emergent incident.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes P-MADDPG, a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that predicts emergent incidents and makes proactive decisions to mitigate their impact, outperforming existing methods in simulated scenarios involving unmanned storage, factory assembly lines, and airport baggage transport. The algorithm uses a GRU model for incident prediction and improves decision-making speed."

    "published_date": "2022-02-23",
    "abstract": "Designing effective emergency response management (ERM) systems to respond to incidents such as road accidents is a major problem faced by communities. In addition to responding to frequent incidents each day (about 240 million emergency medical services calls and over 5 million road accidents in the US each year), these systems also support response during natural hazards. Recently, there has been a consistent interest in building decision support and optimization tools that can help emergency responders provide more efficient and effective response. This includes a number of principled subsystems that implement early incident detection, incident likelihood forecasting and strategic resource allocation and dispatch policies. In this paper, we highlight the key challenges and provide an overview of the approach developed by our team in collaboration with our community partners.",

    "title": "Multi-AI Complex Systems in Humanitarian Response",
    "published_date": "2022-08-24",
    "abstract": "AI is being increasingly used to aid response efforts to humanitarian emergencies at multiple levels of decision-making. Such AI systems are generally understood to be stand-alone tools for decision support, with ethical assessments, guidelines and frameworks applied to them through this lens. However, as the prevalence of AI increases in this domain, such systems will begin to encounter each other through information flow networks created by interacting decision-making entities, leading to multi-AI complex systems which are often ill understood. In this paper we describe how these multi-AI systems can arise, even in relatively simple real-world humanitarian response scenarios, and lead to potentially emergent and erratic erroneous behavior. We discuss how we can better work towards more trustworthy multi-AI systems by exploring some of the associated challenges and opportunities, and how we can design better mechanisms to understand and assess such systems. This paper is designed to be a first exposition on this topic in the field of humanitarian response, raising awareness, exploring the possible landscape of this domain, and providing a starting point for future work within the wider community.",
    "summary": "This paper introduces the concept of multi-AI complex systems emerging from interacting AI tools used in humanitarian response, highlighting the potential for unpredictable and erroneous behavior due to unforeseen interactions between these systems. It calls for further research into understanding, assessing, and designing more trustworthy multi-AI systems in this context."

    "title": "Prioritizing emergency evacuations under compounding levels of uncertainty",
    "published_date": "2022-09-08",
    "abstract": "Well-executed emergency evacuations can save lives and reduce suffering. However, decision makers struggle to determine optimal evacuation policies given the chaos, uncertainty, and value judgments inherent in emergency evacuations. We propose and analyze a decision support tool for pre-crisis training exercises for teams preparing for civilian evacuations and explore the tool in the case of the 2021 U.S.-led evacuation from Afghanistan. We use different classes of Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture compounding levels of uncertainty in (1) the priority category of who appears next at the gate for evacuation, (2) the distribution of priority categories at the population level, and (3) individuals' claimed priority category. We compare the number of people evacuated by priority status under eight heuristic policies. The optimized MDP policy achieves the best performance compared to all heuristic baselines. We also show that accounting for the compounding levels of model uncertainty incurs added complexity without improvement in policy performance. Useful heuristics can be extracted from the optimized policies to inform human decision makers. We opensource all tools to encourage robust dialogue about the trade-offs, limitations, and potential of integrating algorithms into high-stakes humanitarian decision-making.",

    "summary": "This paper develops and analyzes a Markov decision process (MDP) based decision support tool for prioritizing emergency evacuations, comparing its performance against various heuristic policies in the context of the 2021 Afghanistan evacuation. The optimized MDP policy outperforms heuristics, but incorporating compounding uncertainties doesn't significantly improve performance, suggesting simpler, extractable heuristics can effectively guide human decision-making."

    "title": "A proposed system for standardization of colour-coding stages of escalating criticality in clinical incidents",
    "abstract": "Purpose of review This article proposes a standardized framework for colour-coding states of criticality in clinical situations and their respective escalated responses. Recent findings The first level is a green zone representing a 'safe' space (to proceed), where any hazards are controlled, latent or undetectable. The second is an amber zone, where hazards are known to be present, but one can proceed with caution and increased vigilance, and where defences are used to prevent escalation to a crisis. In the red phase -- a state of crisis -- a hazard is realized, clear and present. This is a time to decide what actions are required to mitigate the threat. Next, a blue phase refers to a life-threatening emergency, where the system is unstable, harm is evident and compounding upon itself, and immediate rescue action is needed to avert an irreversible outcome. Finally, dark grey represents the aftermath, where the situation has either stabilized or progressed to its final outcome, a time to reflect and learn. Summary A standardized colour-coding system for assessing and responding to escalating levels of criticality has implications for clinical practice and adverse event reporting systems.",
