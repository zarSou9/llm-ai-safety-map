    "summary": "Household chlorine bleach, a useful disinfectant in emergencies, requires careful handling due to varying concentrations and degradation. Safe and effective use necessitates understanding the bleach's concentration, proper dilution for specific purposes, and the dangers of mixing it with other chemicals."

    "summary": "This article argues against complete COVID-19 suppression strategies, proposing instead a sustainable level of infections and restrictions until a vaccine is available. It uses a cost-benefit analysis, incorporating economic and health impacts (including Quality-Adjusted Life Years, or QALYs), to compare the costs of herd immunity versus prolonged lockdown."

    "summary": "A Bayesian regression analysis of COVID-19 data from 41 countries found support for the effectiveness of closing schools, universities, and businesses, as well as banning gatherings, in reducing the reproduction rate (Rt) of the virus. The study's sensitivity analyses explored various model and data variations to assess the robustness of these findings."

    "title": "Review of Human Decision-making during Computer Security Incident Analysis",
    "abstract": "We review practical advice on decision-making during computer security incident response. Scope includes standards from the IETF, ISO, FIRST, and the US intelligence community. To focus on human decision-making, the scope is the evidence collection, analysis, and reporting phases of response, which includes human decision-making within and connecting these phases. The results indicate both strengths and gaps. A strength is available advice on how to accomplish many specific tasks. However, there is little guidance on how to prioritize tasks in limited time or how to interpret, generalize, and convincingly report results. Future work should focus on these gaps in explication and specification of decision-making during incident analysis.",

    "summary": "This review of computer security incident response highlights existing guidance on evidence collection, analysis, and reporting, but identifies a critical lack of advice on task prioritization and effective result interpretation/reporting under time pressure. Future research should address these gaps in human decision-making support."

    "title": "New paper: Long-Term Trajectories of Human Civilization",
    "published_date": "2018-08-12",
    "summary": "The paper advocates for the scientific and ethical study of human civilization's long-term trajectories, identifying four potential paths: status quo, catastrophe, technological transformation, and astronomical expansion. The authors argue that understanding these trajectories is crucial for informing present-day decisions with potentially immense long-term consequences."

    "title": "The Vulnerable World Hypothesis (by Bostrom)",
    "published_date": "2018-11-06",
    "summary": "Nick Bostrom's \"Vulnerable World Hypothesis\" posits that continued technological development increases the likelihood of civilization-ending events unless global governance significantly improves. This risk stems from both easily accessible destructive technologies and incentives for powerful or numerous actors to cause harm, requiring enhanced preventive measures and international cooperation to mitigate."

    "title": "The map of natural global catastrophic risks",
    "published_date": "2016-09-25",
    "summary": "While asteroid impacts pose a relatively low risk, supervolcano eruptions represent a more significant natural threat. However, the article argues that the greatest risk lies in the potential for underestimation of natural risks due to factors like survivorship bias and the possibility that humanity currently inhabits a fragile and atypical period of environmental stability."
