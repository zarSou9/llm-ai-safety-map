    "title": "Separation Assurance in Urban Air Mobility Systems using Shared Scheduling Protocols",
    "published_date": "2025-01-15",
    "abstract": "Ensuring safe separation between aircraft is a critical challenge in air traffic management, particularly in urban air mobility (UAM) environments where high traffic density and low altitudes require precise control. In these environments, conflicts often arise at the intersections of flight corridors, posing significant risks. We propose a tactical separation approach leveraging shared scheduling protocols, originally designed for Ethernet networks and operating systems, to coordinate access to these intersections. Using a decentralized Markov decision process framework, the proposed approach enables aircraft to autonomously adjust their speed and timing as they navigate these critical areas, maintaining safe separation without a central controller. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in simulated UAM scenarios, demonstrating its ability to reduce separation violations to zero while acknowledging trade-offs in flight times as traffic density increases. Additionally, we explore the impact of non-compliant aircraft, showing that while shared scheduling protocols can no longer guarantee safe separation, they still provide significant improvements over systems without scheduling protocols.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a decentralized, shared scheduling protocol for ensuring safe separation in urban air mobility systems, using a Markov decision process to enable autonomous aircraft conflict resolution at flight corridor intersections, demonstrating zero separation violations in simulation even with non-compliant aircraft."

    "title": "Collaborative Framework with Shared Responsibility for Relief Management in Disaster Scenarios",
    "published_date": "2024-06-15",
    "abstract": "Disasters instances have been increasing both in frequency and intensity causing the tragic loss of life and making life harder for the survivors. Disaster relief management plays a crucial role in enhancing the lifestyle of disaster victims by managing the disaster impacts. Disaster relief management is a process with many collaborative sectors where different stakeholders should operate in all major phases of the disaster management progression. In the different phases of the disaster management process, many collaborative government organisations along with nongovernment organisations, leadership, community, and media at different levels need to share the responsibility with disaster victims to achieve effective disaster relief management. Shared responsibility enhances disaster relief management effectiveness and reduces the disaster's impact on the victims. Considering the diverse roles of different stakeholders, there has been a need for a framework that can bind different stakeholders together during disaster management. this paper shows a framework with major stakeholders of disaster relief management and how different stakeholders can take part in an effective disaster relief management process. The framework also highlights how each stakeholder can contribute to relief management at different phases after a disaster. The paper also explores some of the shared responsibility collaborative practices that have been implemented around the world in response to the disaster as a disaster relief management process. In addition, the paper highlights the knowledge obtained from those disaster instances and how this knowledge can be transferred and can be helpful in disaster mitigation and preparedness for future disaster scenarios.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a collaborative framework for disaster relief management, emphasizing shared responsibility among government and non-government organizations, communities, and victims across all disaster phases. The framework highlights stakeholder contributions and incorporates lessons learned from past disasters to improve future mitigation and preparedness."

    "title": "A Blockchain-Enabled Framework of UAV Coordination for Post- Disaster Networks",
    "published_date": "2024-02-23",
    "abstract": "Emergency communication is critical but challenging after natural disasters when the ground infrastructure is devastated. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enormous potential for agile relief coordination in such scenarios. However, effectively leveraging UAV fleets poses additional challenges, in terms of security, privacy, and efficient collaboration across response agencies. This paper presents a robust blockchain-enabled framework to address these challenges by integrating a consortium blockchain model, smart contracts, and crypto-graphic techniques to securely coordinate UAV fleets for dis-aster response. Specifically, we make two key contributions: a consortium blockchain architecture for secure and private multi-agency coordination and an optimized consensus protocol balancing efficiency and fault tolerance using a delegated proof of stake practical Byzantine fault tolerance (DPoS-PBFT). Com-prehensive simulations show the framework's ability to enhance transparency, automation, scalability, and cyber-attack resilience for UAV coordination in post-disaster networks.",

    "title": "A Secure and Intelligent Data Sharing Scheme for UAV-Assisted Disaster Rescue",
    "published_date": "2022-11-23",
    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to establish flexible and reliable emergency networks in disaster sites when terrestrial communication infrastructures go down. Nevertheless, potential security threats may occur on UAVs during data transmissions due to the untrusted environment and open-access UAV networks. Moreover, UAVs typically have limited battery and computation capacity, making them unaffordable for heavy security provisioning operations when performing complicated rescue tasks. In this paper, we develop RescueChain, a secure and efficient information sharing scheme for UAV-assisted disaster rescue. Specifically, we first implement a lightweight blockchain-based framework to safeguard data sharing under disasters and immutably trace misbehaving entities. A reputation-based consensus protocol is devised to adapt the weakly connected environment with improved consensus efficiency and promoted UAVs' honest behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce a novel vehicular fog computing (VFC)-based off-chain mechanism by leveraging ground vehicles as moving fog nodes to offload UAVs' heavy data processing and storage tasks. To offload computational tasks from the UAVs to ground vehicles with idle computing resources, an optimal allocation strategy is developed by choosing payoffs that achieve equilibrium in a Stackelberg game formulation of the allocation problem. For lack of sufficient knowledge on network model parameters and users' private cost parameters in practical environment, we also design a two-tier deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to seek the optimal payment and resource strategies of UAVs and vehicles with improved learning efficiency. Simulation results show that RescueChain can effectively accelerate consensus process, improve offloading efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and enhance user payoffs.",

    "title": "Automated Generation of Interorganizational Disaster Response Networks through Information Extraction",
    "published_date": "2021-02-27",
    "abstract": "When a disaster occurs, maintaining and restoring community lifelines subsequently require collective efforts from various stakeholders. Aiming at reducing the efforts associated with generating Stakeholder Collaboration Networks (SCNs), this paper proposes a systematic approach to reliable information extraction for stakeholder collaboration and automated network generation. Specifically, stakeholders and their interactions are extracted from texts through Named Entity Recognition (NER), one of the techniques in natural language processing. Once extracted, the collaboration information is transformed into structured datasets to generate the SCNs automatically. A case study of stakeholder collaboration during Hurricane Harvey was investigated and it had demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method. Hence, the proposed approach was proved to significantly reduce practitioners' interpretation and data collection workloads. In the end, discussions and future work are provided.",

    "title": "Virtual Communication Stack: Towards Building Integrated Simulator of Mobile Ad Hoc Network-based Infrastructure for Disaster Response Scenarios",
    "published_date": "2020-04-29",
    "abstract": "Responses to disastrous events are a challenging problem, because of possible damages on communication infrastructures. For instance, after a natural disaster, infrastructures might be entirely destroyed. Different network paradigms were proposed in the literature in order to deploy adhoc network, and allow dealing with the lack of communications. However, all these solutions focus only on the performance of the network itself, without taking into account the specificities and heterogeneity of the components which use it. This comes from the difficulty to integrate models with different levels of abstraction. Consequently, verification and validation of adhoc protocols cannot guarantee that the different systems will work as expected in operational conditions. However, the DEVS theory provides some mechanisms to allow integration of models with different natures. This paper proposes an integrated simulation architecture based on DEVS which improves the accuracy of ad hoc infrastructure simulators in the case of disaster response scenarios.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a DEVS-based integrated simulation architecture for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) used in disaster response, addressing the limitations of existing simulators which neglect the heterogeneity of interacting components. The improved architecture enhances the accuracy of simulating MANET performance in real-world disaster scenarios."

    "title": "Understanding The Dynamics Of Information Flow During Disaster Response Using Absorbing Markov Chains",
    "published_date": "2020-06-11",
    "abstract": "This paper aims to derive a quantitative model to evaluate the impact of information flow on the effectiveness of disaster response. At the core of the model is a specialized absorbing Markov chain that models the process of delivering federal assistance to the community while considering stakeholder interactions and information flow uncertainty. Using the proposed model, the probability of community satisfaction is computed to reflect the effectiveness of disaster response. A hypothetical example is provided to demonstrate the applicability and interpretability of the derived quantitative model. Practically, the research provides governmental stakeholders interpretable insights for evaluating the impact of information flow on their disaster response effectiveness so that proactive actions can be targeted for enhanced disaster response.",
