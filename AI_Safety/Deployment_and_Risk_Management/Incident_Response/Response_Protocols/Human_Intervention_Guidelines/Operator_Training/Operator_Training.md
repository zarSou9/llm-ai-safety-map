### Mini Description

Programs and requirements for preparing human operators to effectively intervene in AI systems, including simulation-based training, certification processes, and ongoing skill maintenance.

### Description

Operator Training in AI safety focuses on developing comprehensive programs to prepare human operators for effectively monitoring, evaluating, and intervening in AI systems during critical incidents. This encompasses both theoretical knowledge of AI systems and practical skills for emergency response, requiring a careful balance between technical understanding and operational decision-making capabilities. The training must address the unique challenges of AI oversight, including the potential for novel failure modes, the complexity of AI decision processes, and the need to maintain situational awareness in rapidly evolving situations.

Current research emphasizes the development of simulation-based training environments that can safely replicate diverse incident scenarios, allowing operators to gain experience without risking real systems. These environments must accurately model both typical and edge-case behaviors, while providing meaningful feedback and assessment mechanisms. Key challenges include determining appropriate fidelity levels for simulations, developing metrics for operator competency, and ensuring training remains relevant as AI systems evolve.

The field increasingly recognizes the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in operator training, moving beyond traditional one-time certification models. This includes investigating methods for maintaining operator readiness through regular drills, developing approaches for rapid skill updates as new AI capabilities or risks emerge, and creating frameworks for measuring and improving operator performance over time. Research questions focus on identifying optimal training intervals, designing effective stress inoculation techniques, and developing methods to prevent skill decay in rarely-used but critical intervention capabilities.
