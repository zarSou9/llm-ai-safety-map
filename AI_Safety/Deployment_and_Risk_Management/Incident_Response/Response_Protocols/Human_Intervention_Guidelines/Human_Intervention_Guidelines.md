### Mini Description

Protocols defining when and how human operators should intervene in AI system operation, including role assignments, authority levels, and decision-making procedures.

### Description

Human Intervention Guidelines in AI safety focus on establishing clear protocols and frameworks for when, how, and by whom human oversight should be exercised over AI systems during incidents. These guidelines must balance the need for swift action with careful deliberation, while accounting for human cognitive limitations, expertise requirements, and the potential for human error. They define the specific conditions that warrant human intervention, the decision-making authority at different organizational levels, and the procedures for executing and documenting interventions.

A critical challenge is designing intervention mechanisms that remain meaningful and effective as AI systems become more complex and potentially operate at speeds beyond human reaction times. This includes developing interfaces that can effectively communicate system states and decision contexts to human operators, establishing clear criteria for when automated systems should defer to human judgment, and creating training protocols that prepare operators for high-stakes decision-making under time pressure. Research in this area draws on insights from human factors engineering, cognitive psychology, and organizational behavior.

Current research focuses on optimizing the human-AI interaction during critical incidents, including work on maintaining human situational awareness, preventing decision paralysis, and ensuring that intervention mechanisms remain robust under stress conditions. Key open questions include how to validate operator readiness, how to maintain meaningful human control as AI capabilities advance, and how to design intervention systems that appropriately balance automation with human oversight. There is particular emphasis on developing guidelines that can adapt to different operational contexts while maintaining consistency in safety standards.
