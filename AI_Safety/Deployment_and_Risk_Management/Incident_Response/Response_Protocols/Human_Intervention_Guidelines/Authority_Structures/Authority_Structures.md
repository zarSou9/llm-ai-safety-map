### Mini Description

Frameworks defining the hierarchy of decision-making power and responsibility during interventions, including role definitions, qualification requirements, and chains of command.

### Description

Authority Structures in AI safety intervention protocols define the organizational hierarchies, decision-making powers, and chains of command necessary for managing human oversight of AI systems during critical incidents. These structures must balance the need for clear, unambiguous authority with the flexibility to incorporate diverse expertise and handle novel situations. They establish who has the power to make different types of intervention decisions, under what circumstances, and with what limitations or checks and balances.

A key challenge is designing authority structures that remain effective across different types of incidents while accounting for varying levels of technical expertise, operational experience, and strategic understanding. This includes defining clear escalation paths, establishing mechanisms for resolving conflicts between different authorities, and ensuring that decision-making power aligns with both capability and responsibility. Research in this area draws on organizational theory, emergency management practices, and studies of high-reliability organizations.

Current research focuses on developing adaptive authority frameworks that can handle the unique challenges posed by AI systems, including the need for rapid decision-making in complex technical scenarios. Key questions include how to balance centralized control with distributed expertise, how to maintain clear lines of authority during fast-moving incidents, and how to design authority structures that remain robust as AI capabilities evolve. There is particular emphasis on creating frameworks that can accommodate both technical and ethical considerations in decision-making.
