    "title": "A General Framework for Verification and Control of Dynamical Models via Certificate Synthesis",
    "published_date": "2023-09-12",
    "abstract": "An emerging branch of control theory specialises in certificate learning, concerning the specification of a desired (possibly complex) system behaviour for an autonomous or control model, which is then analytically verified by means of a function-based proof. However, the synthesis of controllers abiding by these complex requirements is in general a non-trivial task and may elude the most expert control engineers. This results in a need for automatic techniques that are able to design controllers and to analyse a wide range of elaborate specifications. In this paper, we provide a general framework to encode system specifications and define corresponding certificates, and we present an automated approach to formally synthesise controllers and certificates. Our approach contributes to the broad field of safe learning for control, exploiting the flexibility of neural networks to provide candidate control and certificate functions, whilst using SMT-solvers to offer a formal guarantee of correctness. We test our framework by developing a prototype software tool, and assess its efficacy at verification via control and certificate synthesis over a large and varied suite of benchmarks.",

    "title": "Stress Testing Control Loops in Cyber-physical Systems",
    "published_date": "2023-02-27",
    "abstract": "Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) are often safety-critical and deployed in uncertain environments. Identifying scenarios where CPSs do not comply with requirements is fundamental but difficult due to the multidisciplinary nature of CPSs. We investigate the testing of control-based CPSs, where control and software engineers develop the software collaboratively. Control engineers make design assumptions during system development to leverage control theory and obtain guarantees on CPS behaviour. In the implemented system, however, such assumptions are not always satisfied, and their falsification can lead the loss of guarantees. We define stress testing of control-based CPSs as generating tests to falsify such design assumptions. We highlight different types of assumptions, focusing on the use of linearised physics models. To generate stress tests falsifying such assumptions, we leverage control theory to qualitatively characterise the input space of a control-based CPS. We propose a novel test parametrisation for control-based CPSs and use it with the input space characterisation to develop a stress testing approach. We evaluate our approach on three case study systems, including a drone, a continuous-current motor (in five configurations), and an aircraft. Our results show the effectiveness of the proposed testing approach in falsifying the design assumptions and highlighting the causes of assumption violations.",

    "title": "Consolidated Control Barrier Functions: Synthesis and Online Verification via Adaptation under Input Constraints",
    "published_date": "2023-04-04",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a novel adaptation-based approach to constrained control design under multiple state and input constraints. Specifically, we introduce a method for synthesizing any number of time-varying candidate control barrier functions (CBF) into one consolidated CBF (C-CBF) candidate, and propose a predictor-corrector optimization-based adaptation law for the weights of the constituent constraint functions that certifies the C-CBF as valid for a class of nonlinear, control-affine systems. We prove this result by showing that the adapted weights are guaranteed to confer sufficient control authority to meet the new, adaptive C-CBF condition in perpetuity despite input constraints, which thereby permits its use in a quadratic program based control law. We then illustrate the performance of our controller on an academic example, and further highlight that it is successful even for constraint functions with higher or mixed relative-degree by simulating a reach-avoid problem for bicycle robots, which we use to demonstrate how our approach out-performs two baseline approaches.",

    "title": "Verification framework for control theory of aircraft",
    "abstract": "Abstract A control system verification framework is presented for unmanned aerial vehicles using theorem proving. The framework's aim is to set out a procedure for proving that the mathematically designed control system of the aircraft satisfies robustness requirements to ensure safe performance under varying environmental conditions. Extensive mathematical derivations, which have formerly been carried out manually, are checked for their correctness on a computer. To illustrate the procedures, a higher-order logic interactive theorem-prover and an automated theorem-prover are utilised to formally verify a nonlinear attitude control system of a generic multi-rotor UAV over a stability domain within the dynamical state space of the drone. Further benefits of the procedures are that some of the resulting methods can be implemented onboard the aircraft to detect when its controller breaches its flight envelope limits due to severe weather conditions or actuator/sensor malfunction. Such a detection procedure can be used to advise the remote pilot, or an onboard intelligent agent, to decide on some alterations of the planned flight path or to perform emergency landing.",

    "title": "Verifying Switched System Stability With Logic",
    "published_date": "2021-11-02",
    "abstract": "Switched systems are known to exhibit subtle (in)stability behaviors requiring system designers to carefully analyze the stability of closed-loop systems that arise from their proposed switching control laws. This paper presents a formal approach for verifying switched system stability that blends classical ideas from the controls and verification literature using differential dynamic logic (dL), a logic for deductive verification of hybrid systems. From controls, we use standard stability notions for various classes of switching mechanisms and their corresponding Lyapunov function-based analysis techniques. From verification, we use dL's ability to verify quantified properties of hybrid systems and dL models of switched systems as looping hybrid programs whose stability can be formally specified and proven by finding appropriate loop invariants, i.e., properties that are preserved across each loop iteration. This blend of ideas enables a trustworthy implementation of switched system stability verification in the KeYmaera X prover based on dL. For standard classes of switching mechanisms, the implementation provides fully automated stability proofs, including searching for suitable Lyapunov functions. Moreover, the generality of the deductive approach also enables verification of switching control laws that require non-standard stability arguments through the design of loop invariants that suitably express specific intuitions behind those control laws. This flexibility is demonstrated on three case studies: a model for longitudinal flight control by Branicky, an automatic cruise controller, and Brockett's nonholonomic integrator.",
