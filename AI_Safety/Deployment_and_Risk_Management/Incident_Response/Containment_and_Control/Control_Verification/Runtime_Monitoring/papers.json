    "title": "Verification and runtime assurance for dynamical systems with uncertainty",
    "abstract": "In this work, we show how controlled robustly forward invariant sets for systems with disturbances are efficiently identified via the application of the mixed monotonicity property. A mixed monotone system can be embedded in a related deterministic embedding system with twice as many states but for which the dynamics are monotone; one can then apply the powerful theory of monotone dynamical systems to the embedding system to conclude useful properties of the initial mixed monotone system. Using this technique, we present a method for verifying state-feedback controllers against safety (set invariance) constraints, and our approach involves evaluating a control barrier function type condition that requires the vector field of the embedding system to point into a certain southeast cone. This approach also facilitates the construction of runtime assurance mechanisms for controlled systems with disturbances, and we study system safety in the presence of state uncertainty as well. The results and findings of this work are demonstrated through two numerical examples where we study (i) the verification of a controlled spacecraft system against a safety constraint, and (ii) the formation of a runtime assurance mechanism that functions in the presence of uncertain state measurements.",

    "title": "Safety from in-the-loop reachability for cyber-physical systems",
    "abstract": "We demonstrate a methodology for achieving safe autonomy that relies on computing reachable sets at runtime. Given a system subject to disturbances controlled by an unverified and potentially faulty controller, this methodology computes at each time the reachable set of the system under a backup control law to ensure the system is within reach of a known a priori safe region. Control barrier functions are then used in conjunction with the reachable set to adjust potentially unsafe control actions that would otherwise move the system beyond reach of this safe set. This approach faces several computational challenges: reachable sets for the dynamics must be computed at runtime; sensitivity of the reachable set to initial conditions is required for the control barrier optimization formulation; and the presence of disturbances introduces a large number of constraints in the resulting optimization. The proposed methodology leverages the theory of mixed monotone systems to address these challenges, and the main contribution of this paper is an application of this methodology to a ten dimensional dual planar multirotor system that is implemented on embedded hardware with a controller update rate up to 100Hz.",

    "title": "Stealthy Attacks against Robotic Vehicles Protected by Control-based Intrusion Detection Techniques",
    "abstract": "Robotic vehicles (RV) are increasing in adoption in many industrial sectors. RVs use auto-pilot software for perception and navigation and rely on sensors and actuators for operating autonomously in the physical world. Control algorithms have been used in RVs to minimize the effects of noisy sensors, prevent faulty actuator output, and, recently, to detect attacks against RVs. In this article, we demonstrate the vulnerabilities in control-based intrusion detection techniques and propose three kinds of stealthy attacks that evade detection and disrupt RV missions. We also propose automated algorithms for performing the attacks without requiring the attacker to expend significant effort or to know specific details of the RV, thus making the attacks applicable to a wide range of RVs. We demonstrate the attacks on eight RV systems including three real vehicles in the presence of an Intrusion Detection System using control-based techniques to monitor RV's runtime behavior and detect attacks. We find that the control-based techniques are incapable of detecting our stealthy attacks and that the attacks can have significant adverse impact on the RV's mission (e.g., deviate it significantly from its target, or cause it to crash).",

    "title": "Skip to Secure: Securing Cyber-Physical Control Loops with Intentionally Skipped Executions",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of provably securing a given control loop implementation in the presence of adversarial interventions on data exchange between plant and controller. Such interventions can be thwarted using continuously operating monitoring systems and also cryptographic techniques, both of which consume network and computational resources. We provide a principled approach for intentional skipping of control loop executions which may qualify as a useful control-theoretic countermeasure against stealthy attacks which violate message integrity and authenticity. As can be seen, such an approach helps in lowering the resource consumption caused by monitoring/cryptographic security measures.",
