### Mini Description

Architectural patterns that maintain safety properties under system self-modification or improvement, including stable self-reference mechanisms and self-modeling frameworks.

### Description

Recursive Safety addresses the fundamental challenge of maintaining safety guarantees in AI systems capable of self-modification, improvement, or replication. This includes both direct self-modification of code or architecture, and indirect modifications through the creation of successor systems. The core challenge lies in ensuring that safety properties remain invariant through these transformations, even as the system's capabilities and complexity evolve.

Current research approaches include developing formal frameworks for stable self-reference, creating verifiable constraints that persist through modification cycles, and designing architectures that maintain safety properties during capability jumps. Key areas of investigation include methods for encoding safety constraints that remain meaningful as the system's understanding of safety evolves, mechanisms for preserving goal structures through self-modification, and techniques for maintaining human oversight capabilities across system iterations.

Major open questions include how to verify that safety properties are truly preserved across modifications, how to handle potential changes in the system's understanding or interpretation of safety constraints, and how to ensure that safety mechanisms themselves aren't circumvented during self-improvement processes. The field draws heavily on mathematical logic, particularly fixed-point theorems and formal verification, while also incorporating insights from control theory and complex systems analysis.
