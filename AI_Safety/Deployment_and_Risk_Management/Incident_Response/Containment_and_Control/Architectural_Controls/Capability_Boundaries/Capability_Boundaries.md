### Mini Description

Structural approaches to limiting system capabilities and resources, including permission systems, resource quotas, and graduated access controls.

### Description

Capability Boundaries focuses on the architectural mechanisms and principles for restricting and controlling what AI systems can do, particularly through structural constraints built into the system design. This involves developing frameworks for precisely defining and enforcing limitations on system capabilities, including access to computational resources, data, external systems, and potential actions. The field draws on principles from security engineering and permission systems while addressing unique challenges posed by AI systems' potential for finding unexpected ways to achieve goals.

A key challenge is designing capability restrictions that are both precise and robust - preventing harmful or unauthorized actions while allowing necessary functionality. This requires careful consideration of both direct and indirect capabilities, including potential emergent capabilities that might arise from combinations of apparently limited permissions. Current research explores formal frameworks for capability specification, mechanisms for dynamic capability adjustment, and approaches for handling capability composition when multiple system components interact.

Emerging research directions include developing capability systems that remain meaningful under potential advances in AI capabilities, creating verifiable boundaries that cannot be circumvented through clever optimization, and designing graduated capability restrictions that can be safely adjusted based on system performance and trustworthiness. Particular attention is being paid to the challenge of capability boundaries for systems that might attempt to expand their own capabilities, including through self-improvement or exploitation of security vulnerabilities.
