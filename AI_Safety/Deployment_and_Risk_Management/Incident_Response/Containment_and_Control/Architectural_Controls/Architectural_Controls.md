### Mini Description

Design patterns and system architectures that enable inherent containment, including sandbox environments, capability restriction mechanisms, and hierarchical control structures.

### Description

Architectural Controls in AI safety focuses on designing inherent safety mechanisms and constraints directly into the structure and implementation of AI systems. This involves creating system architectures that enforce safety properties by default, rather than relying solely on external monitoring and intervention. Key approaches include sandboxing techniques that isolate system components, capability restriction frameworks that limit system actions, and hierarchical control structures that enable graduated access to resources and capabilities.

A central challenge is designing architectures that maintain robust containment while allowing sufficient flexibility for the system to perform its intended functions. This requires careful consideration of information flow, resource access patterns, and interaction protocols between system components. Current research explores formal methods for verifying architectural safety properties, techniques for secure composition of system components, and approaches for managing the tension between isolation and necessary system integration.

Emerging research directions include developing architectures that support safe recursive self-improvement, creating verifiable barriers between different levels of system capability, and designing compositional safety properties that hold even as systems become more complex. Particular attention is being paid to architectures that can maintain safety guarantees under potential advances in AI capabilities, including systems that might attempt to modify their own architecture.
