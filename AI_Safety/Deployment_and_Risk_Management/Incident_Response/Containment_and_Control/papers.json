    "title": "Combining Switching Mechanism with Re-Initialization and Anomaly Detection for Resiliency of Cyber-Physical Systems",
    "published_date": "2024-09-21",
    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) play a pivotal role in numerous critical real-world applications that have stringent requirements for safety. To enhance the CPS resiliency against attacks, redundancy can be integrated in real-time controller implementations by designing strategies that switch among multiple controllers. However, existing switching strategies typically overlook remediation measures for compromised controllers, opting instead to simply exclude them. Such a solution reduces the CPS redundancy since only a subset of controllers are used. To address this gap, this work proposes a multi-controller switching strategy with periodic re-initialization to remove attacks. Controllers that finish re-initialization can be reused by the switching strategy, preserving the CPS redundancy and resiliency. The proposed switching strategy is designed to ensure that at each switching moment, a controller that has just completed re-initialization is available, minimizing the likelihood of compromise. Additionally, the controller's working period decreases with the number of involved controllers, reducing the controller's exposure time to attacks. An anomaly detector is used to detect CPS attacks during the controller's working period. Upon alarm activation, the current control signal is set to a predefined value, and a switch to an alternative controller occurs at the earliest switching moment. Our switching strategy is shown to be still effective even if the anomaly detector fails to detect (stealthy) attacks.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a resilient multi-controller switching strategy for cyber-physical systems that incorporates periodic controller re-initialization to remove attacks and reuse redundant controllers, maximizing system redundancy and minimizing attack exposure time. An anomaly detector triggers switching to a healthy controller, with the strategy remaining effective even with detector failures."

    "title": "Barriers on the EDGE: A scalable CBF architecture over EDGE for safe aerial-ground multi-agent coordination",
    "published_date": "2024-11-25",
    "abstract": "In this article, we address the problem of designing a scalable control architecture for a safe coordinated operation of a multi-agent system with aerial (UAVs) and ground robots (UGVs) in a confined task space. The proposed method uses Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to impose constraints associated with (i) collision avoidance between agents, (ii) landing of UAVs on mobile UGVs, and (iii) task space restriction. Further, to account for the rapid increase in the number of constraints for a single agent with the increasing number of agents, the proposed architecture uses a centralized-decentralized Edge cluster, where a centralized node (Watcher) activates the relevant constraints, reducing the need for high onboard processing and network complexity. The distributed nodes run the controller locally to overcome latency and network issues. The proposed Edge architecture is experimentally validated using multiple aerial and ground robots in a confined environment performing a coordinated operation.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a scalable, centralized-decentralized control architecture using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for safe multi-agent coordination between UAVs and UGVs in confined spaces, addressing collision avoidance, UAV landing, and task space limitations via an Edge computing cluster to manage constraints efficiently. Experimental validation with multiple robots demonstrates its effectiveness."

    "title": "Resilient Containment Control of Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems Against Unbounded Attacks on Sensors and Actuators",
    "published_date": "2023-01-18",
    "abstract": "Accurate local state measurement is important to ensure the reliable operation of distributed multiagent systems (MASs). Existing fault-tolerant control strategies generally assume the sensor faults to be bounded and uncorrelated. In this article, we study the ramifications of allowing the sensor attack injections to be unbounded and correlated. These malicious sensor attacks may bypass the conventional attack-detection methods and compromise the cooperative performance and even stability of the distributed networked MAS. Moreover, the attackers may gain access to the actuation computing channels and manipulate the control input commands. To this end, we consider the resilient containment control problem of general linear heterogeneous MAS in the face of correlated and unbounded sensor attacks, as well as general unbounded actuator attacks. We propose an attack-resilient control framework to guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical systems and preserve the bounded containment performance. Compared to existing literature addressing bounded faults and/or disturbances that are unintentionally caused in the sensor and actuator channels, the proposed control protocols are resilient against unknown and unbounded attack signals simultaneously, injected into the sensor and actuator channels, and, hence, more practical in real-world security applications. A numerical example illustrates the efficacy of the proposed result by highlighting the resilience improvement over the conventional cooperative control method.",

It proposes a novel control framework guaranteeing uniform ultimate boundedness and bounded containment performance despite these malicious attacks."

    "title": "Stress Testing Control Loops in Cyber-physical Systems",
    "published_date": "2023-02-27",
    "abstract": "Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) are often safety-critical and deployed in uncertain environments. Identifying scenarios where CPSs do not comply with requirements is fundamental but difficult due to the multidisciplinary nature of CPSs. We investigate the testing of control-based CPSs, where control and software engineers develop the software collaboratively. Control engineers make design assumptions during system development to leverage control theory and obtain guarantees on CPS behaviour. In the implemented system, however, such assumptions are not always satisfied, and their falsification can lead the loss of guarantees. We define stress testing of control-based CPSs as generating tests to falsify such design assumptions. We highlight different types of assumptions, focusing on the use of linearised physics models. To generate stress tests falsifying such assumptions, we leverage control theory to qualitatively characterise the input space of a control-based CPS. We propose a novel test parametrisation for control-based CPSs and use it with the input space characterisation to develop a stress testing approach. We evaluate our approach on three case study systems, including a drone, a continuous-current motor (in five configurations), and an aircraft. Our results show the effectiveness of the proposed testing approach in falsifying the design assumptions and highlighting the causes of assumption violations.",

    "published_date": "2022-01-06",
    "abstract": "Distributed parameter systems (DPSs), modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs), are increasingly vulnerable to disturbances arising from various sources. Although the detection of disturbances in PDE systems has received considerable attention in the existing literature, safety control of PDEs under disturbances remains significantly underexplored. In this context, we explore a practical input-to-state safety (pISSf)-based control design approach for a class of DPSs modeled by linear parabolic PDEs. Specifically, we develop a control design framework for this class of system with both safety and stability guarantees based on control Lyapunov functional and control barrier functional. To illustrate our methodology, we apply our strategy to design a thermal control system for battery modules under disturbance. Several simulation studies are done to show the efficacy of our method.",

    "title": "Incident Response Support System for Multi-Located Network by Correlation Analysis of Individual Events",
    "abstract": "Recent targeted attacks have affected large networks, including those made up of multiple locations. Since branch offices are less secure than the headquarters (HQ), it is difficult to completely prevent malware from entering the network through these attacks. Therefore, it is important to quickly detect and respond to these attacks to prevent them from spreading to other locations. However, under the current management system, managers at each site must respond to incidents without sharing information from other sites, and the manager at the HQ cannot obtain enough information to estimate the relationship between the incidents. We propose a management system that refers to all of incident information archived by the organization, generates recommendations on the basis of the similarity between the ongoing incident and archived ones, and notifies each administrator to respond to the incident that occurred in his/her network regardless of resolved or unresolved incidents. The proposed system also notifies the administrators at HQ of the entirety of the attack on the basis of the relationship among recent and ongoing incidents.",

    "published_date": "2021-03-24",
    "abstract": "This study investigates general model-based incident handler's asymptotic behaviors against cyber attacks to control systems. The attacker's and the defender's dynamic decision making is modeled as an equilibrium of a dynamic signaling game. It is shown that the defender's belief on existence of an attacker converges over time for any attacker's strategy provided that the stochastic dynamics of the control system is known to the defender. This fact implies that the rational behavior of the attacker converges to a harmless action as long as the defender possesses an effective counteraction. The obtained result supports the powerful protection capability achieved by model-based defense mechanisms.",

    "summary": "This paper models cyberattacks on control systems as a dynamic signaling game, proving that a model-based defender's belief about an attacker's presence converges, leading to asymptotically harmless attacker actions if the defender has effective countermeasures.

    "published_date": "2021-04-09",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of co-synthesis of edit function and supervisor for opacity enforcement in the supervisory control of discrete-event systems (DES), assuming the presence of an external (passive) intruder, where the following goals need to be achieved: 1) the external intruder should never infer the system secret, i.e., the system is opaque, and never be sure about the existence of the edit function, i.e., the edit function remains covert; 2) the controlled plant behaviors should satisfy some safety and nonblockingness requirements, in the presence of the edit function. We focus on the class of edit functions that satisfy the following properties: 1) the observation capability of the edit function in general can be different from those of the supervisor and the intruder; 2) the edit function can implement insertion, deletion, and replacement operations; 3) the edit function performs bounded edit operations, i.e., the length of each string output of the edit function is upper bounded by a given constant. We propose an approach to solve this cosynthesis problem by modeling it as a distributed supervisor synthesis problem in the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control framework. By taking the special structure of this distributed supervisor synthesis problem into consideration and to improve the possibility of finding a non-empty distributed supervisor, we propose two novel synthesis heuristics that incrementally synthesize the supervisor and the edit function. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on an example in the enforcement of the location privacy.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a method for co-synthesizing an edit function and a supervisor for discrete-event systems to maintain opacity (preventing secret inference by an intruder) while satisfying system requirements.

    "published_date": "2021-06-28",
    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) incorporate the complex and large-scale engineered systems behind critical infrastructure operations, such as water distribution networks, energy delivery systems, healthcare services, manufacturing systems, and transportation networks. Industrial CPS in particular need to simultaneously satisfy requirements of available, secure, safe and reliable system operation against diverse threats, in an adaptive and sustainable way. These adverse events can be of accidental or malicious nature and may include natural disasters, hardware or software faults, cyberattacks, or even infrastructure design and implementation faults. They may drastically affect the results of CPS algorithms and mechanisms, and subsequently the operations of industrial control systems (ICS) deployed in those critical infrastructures. Such a demanding combination of properties and threats calls for resilience-enhancement methodologies and techniques, working in real-time operation. However, the analysis of CPS resilience is a difficult task as it involves evaluation of various interdependent layers with heterogeneous computing equipment, physical components, network technologies, and data analytics. In this paper, we apply the principles of chaos engineering (CE) to industrial CPS, in order to demonstrate the benefits of such practices on system resilience. The systemic uncertainty of adverse events can be tamed by applying runtime CE-based analyses to CPS in production, in order to predict environment changes and thus apply mitigation measures limiting the range and severity of the event, and minimizing its blast radius.",
