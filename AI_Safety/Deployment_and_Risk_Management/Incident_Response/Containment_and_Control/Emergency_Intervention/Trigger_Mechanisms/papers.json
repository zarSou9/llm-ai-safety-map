    "published_date": "2024-08-07",
    "abstract": "Rescue stations around the world receive millions of emergency rescue calls each year, most of which are due to health complications. Due to the high frequency and necessity of rescue services, there is always an increasing demand for quick, accurate, and coordinated responses from rescue personnel to save lives and mitigate damage. This paper introduces a rescue health management software solution designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of rescue situational awareness by rapidly assessing the health status of emergency patients using AI-driven decision support systems. The novelty in this software approach is it's user-centered design principles to ensure that its solutions are specifically tailored to meet the unique requirements of emergency responders. It used pre-trained machine learning models with rescue data and accepted new patient's input data to provide a probability of the major health complications so that rescue personnel can expedite treatment plan following the outcome. The paper focuses primarily on the software development and implementation steps with three use cases, while also providing a short overview of the previous machine learning-based development phases."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence for Emergency Response",
    "published_date": "2023-06-15",
    "abstract": "Emergency response management (ERM) is a challenge faced by communities across the globe. First responders must respond to various incidents, such as fires, traffic accidents, and medical emergencies. They must respond quickly to incidents to minimize the risk to human life. Consequently, considerable attention has been devoted to studying emergency incidents and response in the last several decades. In particular, data-driven models help reduce human and financial loss and improve design codes, traffic regulations, and safety measures. This tutorial paper explores four sub-problems within emergency response: incident prediction, incident detection, resource allocation, and resource dispatch. We aim to present mathematical formulations for these problems and broad frameworks for each problem. We also share open-source (synthetic) data from a large metropolitan area in the USA for future work on data-driven emergency response.",

    "title": "An Emergency Disposal Decision-making Method with Human-Machine Collaboration",
    "published_date": "2023-05-29",
    "abstract": "Rapid developments in artificial intelligence technology have led to unmanned systems replacing human beings in many fields requiring high-precision predictions and decisions. In modern operational environments, all job plans are affected by emergency events such as equipment failures and resource shortages, making a quick resolution critical. The use of unmanned systems to assist decision-making can improve resolution efficiency, but their decision-making is not interpretable and may make the wrong decisions. Current unmanned systems require human supervision and control. Based on this, we propose a collaborative human--machine method for resolving unplanned events using two phases: task filtering and task scheduling. In the task filtering phase, we propose a human--machine collaborative decision-making algorithm for dynamic tasks. The GACRNN model is used to predict the state of the job nodes, locate the key nodes, and generate a machine-predicted resolution task list. A human decision-maker supervises the list in real time and modifies and confirms the machine-predicted list through the human--machine interface. In the task scheduling phase, we propose a scheduling algorithm that integrates human experience constraints. The steps to resolve an event are inserted into the normal job sequence to schedule the resolution. We propose several human--machine collaboration methods in each phase to generate steps to resolve an unplanned event while minimizing the impact on the original job plan."

    "title": "Multi-AI Complex Systems in Humanitarian Response",
    "published_date": "2022-08-24",
    "abstract": "AI is being increasingly used to aid response efforts to humanitarian emergencies at multiple levels of decision-making. Such AI systems are generally understood to be stand-alone tools for decision support, with ethical assessments, guidelines and frameworks applied to them through this lens. However, as the prevalence of AI increases in this domain, such systems will begin to encounter each other through information flow networks created by interacting decision-making entities, leading to multi-AI complex systems which are often ill understood. In this paper we describe how these multi-AI systems can arise, even in relatively simple real-world humanitarian response scenarios, and lead to potentially emergent and erratic erroneous behavior. We discuss how we can better work towards more trustworthy multi-AI systems by exploring some of the associated challenges and opportunities, and how we can design better mechanisms to understand and assess such systems. This paper is designed to be a first exposition on this topic in the field of humanitarian response, raising awareness, exploring the possible landscape of this domain, and providing a starting point for future work within the wider community."

    "title": "Designing Decision Support Systems for Emergency Response: Challenges and Opportunities",
    "published_date": "2022-02-23",
    "abstract": "Designing effective emergency response management (ERM) systems to respond to incidents such as road accidents is a major problem faced by communities. In addition to responding to frequent incidents each day (about 240 million emergency medical services calls and over 5 million road accidents in the US each year), these systems also support response during natural hazards. Recently, there has been a consistent interest in building decision support and optimization tools that can help emergency responders provide more efficient and effective response. This includes a number of principled subsystems that implement early incident detection, incident likelihood forecasting and strategic resource allocation and dispatch policies. In this paper, we highlight the key challenges and provide an overview of the approach developed by our team in collaboration with our community partners.",
