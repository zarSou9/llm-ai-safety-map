    "published_date": "2022-05-21",
    "summary": "Technological advancements in nuclear weapons, coupled with geopolitical shifts, could lead to a future of drastically different nuclear warfare. This includes cheaper, more accessible nukes wielded by a wider range of actors, potentially resulting in regional conflicts, terrorism, and unconventional targeting strategies that could trigger civilizational collapse or even human extinction."

    "abstract": "Unconventional emergencies are the main influencing factors of daily life and teaching activities in colleges and universities, and also one of the difficulties in campus administration. At present, most colleges and universities in the construction of harmonious campuses often focus on the teaching content of ideological politics and professional courses. Dealing with normal administrative affairs on campus and ignoring the harm caused by social emergencies. Under the administrative management of this university, by using the network information platform to construct emergency handling and sharing mechanisms for unconventional emergencies, effectively reduce the potential hazards of conditions such as natural disasters and school violence.",

    "summary": "This research proposes a university emergency information sharing platform designed to mitigate the impact of unconventional events (e.g., natural disasters, violence) on campus life and administration, addressing a current gap in campus management systems. The platform aims to improve emergency response and information dissemination."

    "published_date": "2020-11-07",
    "summary": "A full-scale nuclear war, even utilizing all existing arsenals, is unlikely (<1%) to cause human extinction, primarily because the number of warheads is insufficient to achieve global kinetic destruction or lethal radiation levels across all inhabited areas. While nuclear winter (climate alteration) poses a more plausible extinction risk, its likelihood with current weaponry remains low."

    "title": "Emergency response plan recommendation and composition system (ERPRCS)",
    "abstract": "An emergency response process is a plan that outlines the workflow of different activities that need to be performed in response to an emergency situation. Effective response planning requires inter-operability among systems belonging to different organizations. Unlike typical e-government processes that are well structured and have a well-defined outcome, emergency response processes are knowledge centric and their workflow structure and execution may evolve dynamically based on the environmental context as well as the type of service/activity invoked during process execution. It is impractical to define static plans and response process workflow for every possible situation due to the fact that unforeseeable situations may arise. Thus, a dynamic response requires adaptability to changing situation as the incident evolves. This article presents an approach for development of an Emergency Response Plan Recommendation and Composition System (ERPRCS) that, as the incident evolves, facilitates dynamic composition of an executable response plan by exploiting the knowledge of existing plans and learning from them. Specifically, the ERPRCS system generates an executable response plan from an existing response process that was instantiated for an incident most similar to the current incident. This response plan is customized based on available services and resource provider systems in a given jurisdiction and geographical area.",

    "summary": "The ERPRCS system dynamically generates executable emergency response plans by adapting pre-existing plans to the current situation, leveraging knowledge from similar past incidents and available resources within a specific geographical area. This approach addresses the limitations of static emergency response plans by enabling adaptability to unforeseen circumstances."

    "published_date": "2018-11-06",
    "summary": "Nick Bostrom's \"Vulnerable World Hypothesis\" posits that continued technological development increases the likelihood of civilization-ending events unless global governance significantly improves. This vulnerability stems from easily accessible destructive technologies and misaligned incentives among actors, requiring enhanced preventative measures and international cooperation to mitigate existential risks."
