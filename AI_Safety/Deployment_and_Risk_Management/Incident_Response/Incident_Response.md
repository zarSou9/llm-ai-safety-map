### Mini Description

Protocols and procedures for handling system failures, unexpected behaviors, or safety incidents, including emergency shutdown procedures and recovery mechanisms.

### Description

Incident Response in AI safety encompasses the systematic approaches, protocols, and capabilities needed to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from AI system failures, malfunctions, or unexpected behaviors. This includes both technical response mechanisms and organizational procedures for coordinating human intervention when safety-critical issues arise. The field draws from established incident response practices in other domains like cybersecurity and industrial safety, while addressing unique challenges posed by AI systems' complexity and potential for novel failure modes.

A key focus is developing robust detection and triage systems that can quickly identify and classify incidents, ranging from minor performance degradation to potentially catastrophic failures. This requires sophisticated monitoring systems that can distinguish between normal operational variations and genuine safety concerns, as well as frameworks for assessing incident severity and determining appropriate response levels. Research challenges include developing reliable indicators of system misbehavior, establishing clear thresholds for different types of intervention, and creating effective communication protocols between AI systems and human operators.

Beyond immediate response capabilities, the field emphasizes post-incident analysis and learning to prevent future occurrences and improve response effectiveness. This includes developing methodologies for root cause analysis that can handle the complexity of AI systems, establishing procedures for safe system restoration, and creating frameworks for sharing incident information across organizations while protecting sensitive information. Current research particularly focuses on approaches for maintaining human control during incidents while acknowledging the potential speed at which AI-related incidents might unfold.
