### Mini Description

Techniques for quantifying and communicating confidence levels in severity assessments, including methods for handling ambiguous or incomplete information.

### Description

Uncertainty Characterization in AI safety severity assessment focuses on developing rigorous methods for quantifying, representing, and communicating the confidence levels and areas of ambiguity in incident impact evaluations. This involves addressing multiple sources of uncertainty, including limitations in detection systems, incomplete information about system states, and inherent unpredictability in how incidents might evolve. The field draws from probability theory, epistemic logic, and decision theory while adapting these tools to handle the unique challenges posed by AI systems.

A key challenge lies in distinguishing between different types of uncertainty, such as aleatory uncertainty (inherent randomness in the system), epistemic uncertainty (limitations in our knowledge), and model uncertainty (limitations in our analytical frameworks). Researchers work to develop formal methods for representing these distinct forms of uncertainty and their interactions, while also creating practical tools for rapid uncertainty assessment in time-critical situations. This includes developing metrics for quantifying uncertainty that are both theoretically sound and operationally useful.

Current research particularly focuses on methods for handling deep uncertainty - situations where traditional probabilistic approaches may be insufficient due to fundamental unknowns about possible outcomes or system behaviors. This includes work on robust decision-making under uncertainty, methods for updating uncertainty estimates as new information becomes available, and approaches for effectively communicating uncertainty to decision-makers. There is growing emphasis on developing frameworks that can accommodate both quantitative and qualitative forms of uncertainty while maintaining rigor and reproducibility.
