    "title": "Event Management and Monitoring Framework for HPC Environments using ServiceNow and Prometheus",
    "abstract": "The challenge of monitoring and event response management of a high performance computing facility grows significantly as the facilities employs and orchestrates more complex and heterogeneous systems and infrastructure. As the computational components encompassing the HPC facility system increases, the computational staff experiences rise in alert fatigue due to the false alarms and noise related to the similar events generated by monitoring tools. The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has begun to address the issues of duplication of alerts and alert remediation. However, more automation and integration is needed for collecting, aggregating, correlating, analyzing, managing and visualizing the scale of events that will be generated by the emergent hybrid computing infrastructures. In this paper, we present an event management and monitoring framework that addresses the operational needs of the future pre-exascale systems at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). The framework integrates the Operations Monitoring and Notification Infrastructure (OMNI) at NERSC with the Prometheus, Grafana and ServiceNow platforms to help identify, diagnose, and resolve incidents in real-time, as well as conduct more thorough post-incident reviews enabled by the intuitive dashboards that provides a single pane of glass console for an efficient operations management and real-time proactive monitoring.",

    "title": "From facility to application sensor data: modular, continuous and holistic monitoring with DCDB",
    "abstract": "Today's HPC installations are highly-complex systems, and their complexity will only increase as we move to exascale and beyond. At each layer, from facilities to systems, from runtimes to applications, a wide range of tuning decisions must be made in order to achieve efficient operation. This, however, requires systematic and continuous monitoring of system and user data. While many insular solutions exist, a system for holistic and facility-wide monitoring is still lacking in the current HPC ecosystem. In this paper we introduce DCDB, a comprehensive monitoring system capable of integrating data from all system levels. It is designed as a modular and highly-scalable framework based on a plugin infrastructure. All monitored data is aggregated at a distributed noSQL data store for analysis and cross-system correlation. We demonstrate the performance and scalability of DCDB, and describe two use cases in the area of energy management and characterization.",

    "abstract": "With the exponential increase in number of connected sensor devices for various smart home applications, a huge amount of heterogeneous data are generated every day. Collection technique plays a crucial role in defining the application QoS. In this paper, we propose a novel data collection framework to serve different applications used for critical infrastructure monitoring. The proposed framework adopts a context-aware forwarding strategy to ensure higher delivery reliability. The overall cost of data collection is significantly low due to the incorporation of in-network data aggregation and fusion on demand basis. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has also been established using simulation results.",
