    "title": "A General Architecture for a Real-Time Monitoring System Based on the Internet of Things",
    "abstract": "Recently there has been significant progress in the real-time monitoring system based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The use rate of IoT has been increasing exponentially because of its enormous application in different areas, with many of them are yet to be explored. This paper explains how to design an IoT system and describes its working mechanism. We present a general architecture of the real-time monitoring system using IoT and related services. We successfully implement our proposed architecture for a single domain. Then, we describe how to use the proposed architecture to monitor the different real-time contextual domains. Also, we present ideas on how to plug the data from a third-party application into the proposed architecture.",
