    "title": "Assessing the Impact of Technical Indicators on Machine Learning Models for Stock Price Prediction",
    "published_date": "2024-12-19",
    "abstract": "This study evaluates the performance of random forest regression models enhanced with technical indicators for high-frequency stock price prediction. Using minute-level SPY data, we assessed 13 models that incorporate technical indicators such as Bollinger bands, exponential moving average, and Fibonacci retracement. While these models improved risk-adjusted performance metrics, they struggled with out-of-sample generalization, highlighting significant overfitting challenges. Feature importance analysis revealed that primary price-based features consistently outperformed technical indicators, suggesting their limited utility in high-frequency trading contexts. These findings challenge the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis, identifying short-lived inefficiencies during volatile periods but its limited persistence across market regimes. The study emphasizes the need for selective feature engineering, adaptive modeling, and a stronger focus on risk-adjusted performance metrics to navigate the complexities of high-frequency trading environments."

    "title": "An Architectural Technical Debt Index Based on Machine Learning and Architectural Smells",
    "published_date": "2023-01-16",
    "abstract": "A key aspect of technical debt (TD) management is the ability to measure the amount of principal accumulated in a system. The current literature contains an array of approaches to estimate TD principal, however, only a few of them focus specifically on architectural TD, but none of them satisfies all three of the following criteria: being fully automated, freely available, and thoroughly validated. Moreover, a recent study has shown that many of the current approaches suffer from certain shortcomings, such as relying on hand-picked thresholds. In this article, we propose a novel approach to estimate architectural technical debt principal based on machine learning and architectural smells to address such shortcomings. Our approach can estimate the amount of technical debt principal generated by a single architectural smell instance. To do so, we adopt novel techniques from Information Retrieval to train a learning-to-rank machine learning model (more specifically, a gradient boosting machine) that estimates the severity of an architectural smell and ensure the transparency of the predictions. Then, for each instance, we statically analyse the source code to calculate the exact number of lines of code creating the smell. Finally, we combine these two values to calculate the technical debt principal. To validate the approach, we conducted a case study and interviewed 16 practitioners, from both open source and industry, and asked them about their opinions on the TD principal estimations for several smells detected in their projects. The results show that for 71% of instances, practitioners agreed that the estimations provided were representative of the effort necessary to refactor the smell.",

    "title": "Monitoring Runtime Metrics of Fog Manufacturing via a Qualitative and Quantitative (QQ) Control Chart",
    "abstract": "Fog manufacturing combines Fog and Cloud computing in a manufacturing network to provide efficient data analytics and support real-time decision-making. Detecting anomalies, including imbalanced computational workloads and cyber-attacks, is critical to ensure reliable and responsive computation services. However, such anomalies often concur with dynamic offloading events where computation tasks are migrated from well-occupied Fog nodes to less-occupied ones to reduce the overall computation time latency and improve the throughput. Such concurrences jointly affect the system behaviors, which makes anomaly detection inaccurate. We propose a qualitative and quantitative (QQ) control chart to monitor system anomalies through identifying the changes of monitored runtime metric relationship (quantitative variables) under the presence of dynamic offloading (qualitative variable) using a risk-adjusted monitoring framework. Both the simulation and Fog manufacturing case studies show the advantage of the proposed method compared with the existing literature under the dynamic offloading influence.",

    "title": "Measuring Early Detection of Anomalies",
    "abstract": "Early detection is a matter of growing importance in multiple domains as network security, health conditions over social network services or weather forecasts related disasters. It is not enough to make a good decision but it also needs to be made on time. In this paper, we define a method to evaluate detection of anomalies in time-aware systems. To do so, we present the early detection problem from a generic perspective, examine the evaluation metrics available and propose a new metric, named TaP (Time aware Precision). A set of experiments using three different datasets from different fields are performed in order to compare the behaviour of the different metrics. Two different approaches were followed, first a batch evaluation is performed, followed by a streaming evaluation which allows to present a more realistic behaviour of the systems. For both steps, we propose two sets of experiments. The first one using baseline models, followed by the evaluation of a set of Machine Learning algorithms results. The presented metric allows the amount of items needed to take a decision to be taken into account, not depending on the specific dataset but on the nature of the problem to solve.",
