### Mini Description

Machine learning approaches that learn to identify anomalies from historical data or through self-supervision, including autoencoders, density estimation models, and novelty detection systems.

### Description

Learning-based detection approaches leverage machine learning techniques to identify anomalous behaviors in AI systems, either through supervised learning from labeled incident data or through unsupervised learning of normal behavior patterns. These methods can capture complex, high-dimensional relationships and adapt to evolving system behaviors that might be missed by traditional statistical approaches. The field encompasses both specialized architectures designed specifically for anomaly detection and adapted versions of standard deep learning models.

A central challenge is the inherent scarcity of training data for genuine AI safety incidents, leading to increased focus on self-supervised and few-shot learning approaches. Researchers are developing methods that can learn from synthetic anomalies, transfer knowledge from related domains, or leverage large amounts of normal behavior data to build robust detection capabilities. This includes work on contrastive learning, representation learning, and meta-learning approaches that can generalize from limited examples.

Current research particularly focuses on developing detection systems that maintain reliability under distribution shift and can identify novel types of anomalies not seen during training. Key areas include uncertainty quantification in detector outputs, methods for continuous online learning that avoid catastrophic forgetting, and approaches for explaining and validating detection decisions. There is growing emphasis on systems that can detect subtle or gradual behavioral changes that might indicate emerging safety issues before they become critical.
