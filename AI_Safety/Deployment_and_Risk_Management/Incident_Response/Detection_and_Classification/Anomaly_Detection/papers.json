    "summary": "Variational Bayesian methods address the intractability of calculating P(x) in Bayesian inference by approximating the true posterior P(z|x) with an easier-to-compute distribution Q(z|x), minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between them to obtain an approximate solution. This avoids integrating over the entire high-dimensional latent space, improving computational efficiency."

    "published_date": "2022-04-03",
    "summary": "While the Gaussian distribution is often used to approximate probabilities from binary count data, the Beta distribution is more accurate, especially with small datasets or probabilities near 0 or 1. The Gaussian approximation breaks down in these cases, yielding nonsensical results like negative probabilities, whereas the Beta distribution provides a reliable alternative easily implemented in common statistical software."

    "title": "An Efficient One-Class SVM for Anomaly Detection in the Internet of Things",
    "published_date": "2021-04-22",
    "abstract": "Insecure Internet of things (IoT) devices pose significant threats to critical infrastructure and the Internet at large; detecting anomalous behavior from these devices remains of critical importance, but fast, efficient, accurate anomaly detection (also called\"novelty detection\") for these classes of devices remains elusive. One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) are one of the state-of-the-art approaches for novelty detection (or anomaly detection) in machine learning, due to their flexibility in fitting complex nonlinear boundaries between {normal} and {novel} data. IoT devices in smart homes and cities and connected building infrastructure present a compelling use case for novelty detection with OCSVM due to the variety of devices, traffic patterns, and types of anomalies that can manifest in such environments. Much previous research has thus applied OCSVM to novelty detection for IoT. Unfortunately, conventional OCSVMs introduce significant memory requirements and are computationally expensive at prediction time as the size of the train set grows, requiring space and time that scales with the number of training points. These memory and computational constraints can be prohibitive in practical, real-world deployments, where large training sets are typically needed to develop accurate models when fitting complex decision boundaries. In this work, we extend so-called Nystr\\\"om and (Gaussian) Sketching approaches to OCSVM, by combining these methods with clustering and Gaussian mixture models to achieve significant speedups in prediction time and space in various IoT settings, without sacrificing detection accuracy.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the computational limitations of One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVMs) for anomaly detection in IoT systems by integrating Nystr√∂m and sketching methods with clustering and Gaussian mixture models, achieving faster prediction times and reduced memory usage without compromising accuracy. The improved efficiency makes OCSVM more practical for real-world IoT anomaly detection applications with large datasets."

    "published_date": "2020-03-30",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is crucial to ensure the security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of CPSs and more sophisticated attacks, conventional anomaly detection methods cannot be directly applied to thwart such issues, which also need domain-specific knowledge and handle the growing volume of data. Deep learning-based anomaly detection (DLAD) methods have been proposed to achieve unsupervised detection in the era of CPS big data. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art DLAD methods in CPSs. We propose a taxonomy in terms of the type of anomalies, strategies, implementation and evaluation metrics to understand the essential properties of current methods. Further, we utilize this taxonomy to identify and highlight new characteristics and designs in each CPS domain. We summarise a list of publicly available datasets for training and evaluation. We also discuss our findings, the limitations of existing studies, and possible directions to improve DLAD methods.",

    "title": "Unsupervised Abnormality Detection Using Heterogeneous Autonomous Systems",
    "published_date": "2020-06-05",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) in a surveillance scenario is an emerging and challenging field of research. For autonomous vehicles like drones or cars, it is immensely important to distinguish between normal and abnormal states in real-time. Additionally, we also need to detect any device malfunction. But the nature and degree of abnormality may vary depending upon the actual environment and adversary. As a result, it is impractical to model all cases a-priori and use supervised methods to classify. Also, an autonomous vehicle provides various data types like images and other analog or digital sensor data, all of which can be useful in anomaly detection if leveraged fruitfully. To that effect, in this paper, a heterogeneous system is proposed which estimates the degree of abnormality of an unmanned surveillance drone, analyzing real-time image and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Here, we have demonstrated a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, named AngleNet to estimate the angle between a normal image and another image under consideration, which provides us with a measure of anomaly of the device. Moreover, the IMU data are used in autoencoder to predict abnormality. Finally, the results from these two algorithms are ensembled to estimate the final degree of abnormality. The proposed method performs satisfactorily on the IEEE SP Cup-2020 dataset with an accuracy of 97.3%. Additionally, we have also tested this approach on an in-house dataset to validate its robustness.",
