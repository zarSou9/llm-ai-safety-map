### Mini Description

Systems and methods for identifying incidents and categorizing them by type, severity, and required response level, including early warning indicators and automated detection mechanisms.

### Description

Detection and Classification in AI safety incident response focuses on developing robust systems and methodologies for identifying potentially harmful or anomalous AI behaviors and appropriately categorizing them for response. This encompasses both automated monitoring systems that can detect deviations from expected behavior patterns and frameworks for assessing the severity and nature of detected incidents. Key challenges include handling the complexity of modern AI systems, dealing with subtle or gradual degradation of performance, and managing the trade-off between false positives and missed detections.

A critical aspect is the development of reliable indicators and metrics that can serve as early warning signs of potential problems. This includes both direct performance metrics and indirect indicators such as resource usage patterns, interaction characteristics, or changes in internal state distributions. Research in this area draws from anomaly detection, statistical process control, and systems monitoring, while addressing unique challenges posed by AI systems' complex, often opaque decision-making processes and potential for novel failure modes.

Current research particularly focuses on developing more sophisticated detection mechanisms that can identify subtle alignment failures, capability jumps, or deceptive behaviors. This includes work on interpretability tools for better understanding system behavior, methods for detecting distribution shift and out-of-distribution inputs, and approaches for distinguishing between benign performance variations and potentially dangerous behavioral changes. There is also increasing emphasis on developing standardized taxonomies and classification frameworks to enable more systematic incident response and cross-organization learning.
