### Mini Description

Research on how different cognitive architectures might inherently bias AI systems toward particular ethical frameworks or moral reasoning strategies.

### Description

Architectural Biases explores how different AI system architectures inherently predispose systems toward particular approaches to ethical reasoning and moral decision-making. This includes studying how fundamental design choices in areas like information processing, memory organization, and decision-making mechanisms can create systematic tendencies in how AI systems interpret and apply ethical principles, even before specific training or value learning occurs.

The field examines both explicit biases that arise from intentional architectural choices and implicit biases that emerge from seemingly neutral design decisions. Researchers investigate how different computational paradigms (e.g., symbolic vs. subsymbolic processing, local vs. distributed representations) influence moral reasoning patterns. This includes analyzing how architectural features affect aspects like moral abstraction capability, value trade-off handling, and the balance between rule-based and consequentialist reasoning.

A critical focus is understanding how these architectural biases might interact with training processes and real-world deployment. This includes studying how initial architectural tendencies might be amplified or suppressed through learning, how they influence the stability and robustness of learned ethical behaviors, and how they affect an AI system's ability to generalize ethical principles across different contexts. Understanding these relationships is crucial for designing systems that can reliably align with human values while avoiding unintended ethical failure modes.
