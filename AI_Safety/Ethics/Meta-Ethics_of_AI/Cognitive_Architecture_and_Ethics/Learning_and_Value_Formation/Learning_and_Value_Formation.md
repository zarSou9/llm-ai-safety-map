### Mini Description

Analysis of how different learning architectures influence the development and stability of value systems in AI, including the role of various learning mechanisms in moral development.

### Description

Learning and Value Formation examines how artificial intelligence systems develop, internalize, and maintain value systems through different learning mechanisms and architectures. This includes studying how various approaches to machine learning - from supervised learning on ethical datasets to inverse reinforcement learning from human preferences - influence an AI system's ability to acquire and represent values in stable and generalizable ways. The field explores both the technical challenges of value learning and the theoretical foundations needed to ensure learned values remain robust under self-modification or distribution shift.

A central focus is understanding how different learning paradigms affect value acquisition and stability. This includes investigating how value systems emerge from different training approaches, whether certain learning architectures are more prone to value drift or inconsistency, and how to ensure learned values remain stable even as an AI system continues to learn and adapt. Researchers examine the relationship between learning mechanisms and value internalization, including whether certain approaches lead to more deeply embedded versus superficially learned values.

The field also addresses the challenge of value corruption during learning, including how to prevent unwanted value drift, maintain value stability during capability gains, and ensure learned values generalize appropriately to novel situations. This involves studying how different learning architectures handle conflicts between learned values and reward signals, how to implement constraints that prevent value degradation during learning, and how to verify that learned values align with intended principles. Particular attention is paid to the dynamics of value formation in systems capable of recursive self-improvement.
