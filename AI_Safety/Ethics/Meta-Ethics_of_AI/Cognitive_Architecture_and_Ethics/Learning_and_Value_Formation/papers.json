    "title": "Building Altruistic and Moral AI Agent with Brain-inspired Affective Empathy Mechanisms",
    "published_date": "2024-10-29",
    "abstract": "As AI closely interacts with human society, it is crucial to ensure that its decision-making is safe, altruistic, and aligned with human ethical and moral values. However, existing research on embedding ethical and moral considerations into AI remains insufficient, and previous external constraints based on principles and rules are inadequate to provide AI with long-term stability and generalization capabilities. In contrast, the intrinsic altruistic motivation based on empathy is more willing, spontaneous, and robust. Therefore, this paper is dedicated to autonomously driving intelligent agents to acquire morally behaviors through human-like affective empathy mechanisms. We draw inspiration from the neural mechanism of human brain's moral intuitive decision-making, and simulate the mirror neuron system to construct a brain-inspired affective empathy-driven altruistic decision-making model. Here, empathy directly impacts dopamine release to form intrinsic altruistic motivation. Based on the principle of moral utilitarianism, we design the moral reward function that integrates intrinsic empathy and extrinsic self-task goals. A comprehensive experimental scenario incorporating empathetic processes, personal objectives, and altruistic goals is developed. The proposed model enables the agent to make consistent moral decisions (prioritizing altruism) by balancing self-interest with the well-being of others. We further introduce inhibitory neurons to regulate different levels of empathy and verify the positive correlation between empathy levels and altruistic preferences, yielding conclusions consistent with findings from psychological behavioral experiments. This work provides a feasible solution for the development of ethical AI by leveraging the intrinsic human-like empathy mechanisms, and contributes to the harmonious coexistence between humans and AI.",

The model uses inhibitory neurons to regulate empathy levels and demonstrates a positive correlation between empathy and altruistic behavior."

    "title": "Acting for the Right Reasons: Creating Reason-Sensitive Artificial Moral Agents",
    "published_date": "2024-09-23",
    "abstract": "We propose an extension of the reinforcement learning architecture that enables moral decision-making of reinforcement learning agents based on normative reasons. Central to this approach is a reason-based shield generator yielding a moral shield that binds the agent to actions that conform with recognized normative reasons so that our overall architecture restricts the agent to actions that are (internally) morally justified. In addition, we describe an algorithm that allows to iteratively improve the reason-based shield generator through case-based feedback from a moral judge.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a reinforcement learning architecture augmented with a \"reason-based shield\" that guides agents towards morally justified actions based on normative reasons. The architecture is iteratively improved via feedback from a moral judge, ensuring actions align with pre-defined ethical standards."

    "title": "Value Internalization: Learning and Generalizing from Social Reward",
    "published_date": "2024-07-19",
    "abstract": "Social rewards shape human behavior. During development, a caregiver guides a learner's behavior towards culturally aligned goals and values. How do these behaviors persist and generalize when the caregiver is no longer present, and the learner must continue autonomously? Here, we propose a model of value internalization where social feedback trains an internal social reward (ISR) model that generates internal rewards when social rewards are unavailable. Through empirical simulations, we show that an ISR model prevents agents from unlearning socialized behaviors and enables generalization in out-of-distribution tasks. We characterize the implications of incomplete internalization, akin to\"reward hacking\"on the ISR. Additionally, we show that our model internalizes prosocial behavior in a multi-agent environment. Our work provides a foundation for understanding how humans acquire and generalize values and offers insights for aligning AI with human values.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a computational model of value internalization where social rewards train an internal social reward (ISR) model, enabling agents to maintain and generalize learned behaviors even without external reinforcement. The model demonstrates how this internalization process prevents unlearning and facilitates generalization to novel situations, while also highlighting potential limitations like \"reward hacking.\""

    "title": "Value Engineering for Autonomous Agents",
    "published_date": "2023-02-17",
    "abstract": "Machine Ethics (ME) is concerned with the design of Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs), i.e. autonomous agents capable of reasoning and behaving according to moral values. Previous approaches have treated values as labels associated with some actions or states of the world, rather than as integral components of agent reasoning. It is also common to disregard that a value-guided agent operates alongside other value-guided agents in an environment governed by norms, thus omitting the social dimension of AMAs. In this blue sky paper, we propose a new AMA paradigm grounded in moral and social psychology, where values are instilled into agents as context-dependent goals. These goals intricately connect values at individual levels to norms at a collective level by evaluating the outcomes most incentivized by the norms in place. We argue that this type of normative reasoning, where agents are endowed with an understanding of norms' moral implications, leads to value-awareness in autonomous agents. Additionally, this capability paves the way for agents to align the norms enforced in their societies with respect to the human values instilled in them, by complementing the value-based reasoning on norms with agreement mechanisms to help agents collectively agree on the best set of norms that suit their human values. Overall, our agent model goes beyond the treatment of values as inert labels by connecting them to normative reasoning and to the social functionalities needed to integrate value-aware agents into our modern hybrid human-computer societies.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a novel framework for designing Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs) that integrates moral values as context-dependent goals, connecting individual values to societal norms through normative reasoning and agreement mechanisms to achieve value-alignment in human-computer societies. This approach moves beyond treating values as simple labels, embedding them deeply within the agent's decision-making process."

    "title": "Modeling Moral Choices in Social Dilemmas with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2023-01-20",
    "abstract": "Practical uses of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the real world have demonstrated the importance of embedding moral choices into intelligent agents. They have also highlighted that defining top-down ethical constraints on AI according to any one type of morality is extremely challenging and can pose risks. A bottom-up learning approach may be more appropriate for studying and developing ethical behavior in AI agents. In particular, we believe that an interesting and insightful starting point is the analysis of emergent behavior of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that act according to a predefined set of moral rewards in social dilemmas.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we present a systematic analysis of the choices made by intrinsically-motivated RL agents whose rewards are based on moral theories. We aim to design reward structures that are simplified yet representative of a set of key ethical systems. Therefore, we first define moral reward functions that distinguish between consequence- and norm-based agents, between morality based on societal norms or internal virtues, and between single- and mixed-virtue (e.g., multi-objective) methodologies. Then, we evaluate our approach by modeling repeated dyadic interactions between learning moral agents in three iterated social dilemma games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Volunteer's Dilemma and Stag Hunt). We analyze the impact of different types of morality on the emergence of cooperation, defection or exploitation, and the corresponding social outcomes. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the development of moral agents in artificial and mixed human-AI societies.",

    "title": "Culturally-Attuned Moral Machines: Implicit Learning of Human Value Systems by AI through Inverse Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2023-12-29",
    "abstract": "Constructing a universal moral code for artificial intelligence (AI) is difficult or even impossible, given that different human cultures have different definitions of morality and different societal norms. We therefore argue that the value system of an AI should be culturally attuned: just as a child raised in a particular culture learns the specific values and norms of that culture, we propose that an AI agent operating in a particular human community should acquire that community's moral, ethical, and cultural codes. How AI systems might acquire such codes from human observation and interaction has remained an open question. Here, we propose using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) as a method for AI agents to acquire a culturally-attuned value system implicitly. We test our approach using an experimental paradigm in which AI agents use IRL to learn different reward functions, which govern the agents' moral values, by observing the behavior of different cultural groups in an online virtual world requiring real-time decision making. We show that an AI agent learning from the average behavior of a particular cultural group can acquire altruistic characteristics reflective of that group's behavior, and this learned value system can generalize to new scenarios requiring altruistic judgments. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that AI agents could potentially be endowed with the ability to continually learn their values and norms from observing and interacting with humans, thereby becoming attuned to the culture they are operating in.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes using inverse reinforcement learning to enable AI agents to implicitly learn culturally-attuned moral values by observing and interacting with humans within a virtual environment, demonstrating that AI can acquire altruistic characteristics reflecting the observed cultural group's behavior. The research shows this learned value system generalizes to new scenarios, suggesting a path toward culturally-sensitive AI."

    "title": "Learning Roles with Emergent Social Value Orientations",
    "published_date": "2023-01-31",
    "abstract": "Social dilemmas can be considered situations where individual rationality leads to collective irrationality. The multi-agent reinforcement learning community has leveraged ideas from social science, such as social value orientations (SVO), to solve social dilemmas in complex cooperative tasks. In this paper, by first introducing the typical\"division of labor or roles\"mechanism in human society, we provide a promising solution for intertemporal social dilemmas (ISD) with SVOs. A novel learning framework, called Learning Roles with Emergent SVOs (RESVO), is proposed to transform the learning of roles into the social value orientation emergence, which is symmetrically solved by endowing agents with altruism to share rewards with other agents. An SVO-based role embedding space is then constructed by individual conditioning policies on roles with a novel rank regularizer and mutual information maximizer. Experiments show that RESVO achieves a stable division of labor and cooperation in ISDs with different complexity.",

    "summary": "The RESVO framework addresses intertemporal social dilemmas by learning roles that emerge from social value orientations, using a novel learning approach that leverages altruism and a role embedding space to achieve stable cooperation and division of labor. This approach transforms role learning into the emergence of social value orientations."

    "title": "Hybrid Approaches for Moral Value Alignment in AI Agents: a Manifesto",
    "published_date": "2023-12-04",
    "abstract": "Increasing interest in ensuring the safety of next-generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems calls for novel approaches to embedding morality into autonomous agents. This goal differs qualitatively from traditional task-specific AI methodologies. In this paper, we provide a systematization of existing approaches to the problem of introducing morality in machines - modelled as a continuum. Our analysis suggests that popular techniques lie at the extremes of this continuum - either being fully hard-coded into top-down, explicit rules, or entirely learned in a bottom-up, implicit fashion with no direct statement of any moral principle (this includes learning from human feedback, as applied to the training and finetuning of large language models, or LLMs). Given the relative strengths and weaknesses of each type of methodology, we argue that more hybrid solutions are needed to create adaptable and robust, yet controllable and interpretable agentic systems. To that end, this paper discusses both the ethical foundations (including deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics) and implementations of morally aligned AI systems. We present a series of case studies that rely on intrinsic rewards, moral constraints or textual instructions, applied to either pure-Reinforcement Learning or LLM-based agents. By analysing these diverse implementations under one framework, we compare their relative strengths and shortcomings in developing morally aligned AI systems. We then discuss strategies for evaluating the effectiveness of moral learning agents. Finally, we present open research questions and implications for the future of AI safety and ethics which are emerging from this hybrid framework.",

    "summary": "This paper argues that achieving moral alignment in AI requires hybrid approaches combining explicitly coded moral rules with implicitly learned behaviors, bridging the gap between top-down and bottom-up methods; it analyzes existing techniques, proposes a framework for hybrid solutions, and identifies key research challenges in evaluating and developing morally aligned AI agents."
