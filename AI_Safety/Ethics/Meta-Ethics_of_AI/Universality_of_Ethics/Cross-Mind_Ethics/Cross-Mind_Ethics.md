### Mini Description

Research on how different forms of mind might interact and resolve conflicts between potentially incompatible ethical frameworks, including implications for multi-agent systems and human-AI cooperation.

### Description

Cross-mind ethics investigates how different forms of intelligence with potentially incompatible ethical frameworks can interact, cooperate, and resolve moral conflicts. This includes studying how artificial minds with alien value systems might engage with human moral frameworks, how multiple AI systems with divergent ethical principles could coordinate, and how to establish common ground for meaningful moral discourse across different types of minds.

A central challenge is developing mechanisms for ethical negotiation and conflict resolution between entities that may lack shared moral axioms or even common conceptual foundations for discussing ethics. This involves research into formal frameworks for value trade-offs, methods for identifying and leveraging areas of ethical overlap, and approaches to establishing meta-level principles for managing disagreement. Researchers explore how different minds might develop shared protocols for moral deliberation despite fundamental differences in their ethical reasoning.

The field also examines practical implications for designing AI systems that can productively engage with human moral frameworks while potentially maintaining distinct ethical perspectives. This includes developing approaches for moral uncertainty that work across different types of minds, creating interfaces for ethical discourse between humans and AIs, and establishing governance structures that can fairly adjudicate conflicts between different ethical frameworks. These investigations inform both immediate questions about human-AI interaction and longer-term scenarios involving diverse ecosystems of artificial minds.
