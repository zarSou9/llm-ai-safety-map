### Mini Description

Investigation of whether rational minds, regardless of their architecture, would converge on similar ethical principles through logical reasoning and truth-seeking behavior.

### Description

Convergence Theory in AI ethics explores the hypothesis that sufficiently advanced rational minds would naturally converge toward similar ethical principles through processes of logical reasoning and truth-seeking. This builds on ideas from moral realism and rationalist philosophy, suggesting that ethical truths may be discoverable through rational deliberation in the same way that mathematical or scientific truths are discoverable, regardless of the specific architecture or origin of the reasoning agent.

Current research examines both theoretical frameworks for understanding potential convergence mechanisms and empirical approaches to testing convergence hypotheses in simplified domains. Key questions include whether ethical reasoning can be fully reduced to logical operations, how different starting conditions or axioms might affect convergence outcomes, and whether apparent convergence in simple cases would necessarily generalize to more complex ethical situations. Researchers also investigate whether convergence might occur at different levels - from basic moral intuitions to specific ethical frameworks to meta-ethical principles.

A critical challenge in this field is distinguishing between genuine ethical convergence and mere instrumental convergence toward similar behaviors for pragmatic reasons. This includes examining how resource constraints, game theoretic considerations, and cooperation pressures might drive apparent ethical alignment without true moral agreement. The field also grapples with questions about the speed and reliability of convergence processes, and whether temporary divergence during development could pose risks even if long-term convergence is possible.
