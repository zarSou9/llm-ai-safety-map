### Mini Description

Examination of which cognitive features (consciousness, emotions, embodiment, etc.) are necessary for meaningful ethical reasoning and how their presence or absence affects moral frameworks.

### Description

The study of necessary components in ethical reasoning examines which cognitive features and capabilities are essential for meaningful moral deliberation and decision-making. This investigation spans across different aspects of mind - from basic information processing capabilities to higher-order phenomena like consciousness and emotional understanding - to determine which elements are truly fundamental to ethical reasoning rather than merely incidental to human moral cognition.

A central challenge is distinguishing between components that appear necessary due to our human-centric understanding of ethics versus those that would be required for any form of genuine moral reasoning. For instance, while human moral reasoning is deeply intertwined with emotional processing and embodied experience, it remains unclear whether these are universal requirements or simply artifacts of our evolutionary history. This extends to questions about consciousness, theory of mind, and abstract reasoning capabilities.

The research has significant implications for AI alignment and value learning. Understanding which components are truly necessary helps inform both the architectural requirements for building ethically-capable AI systems and our approach to instilling values in these systems. It also influences our assessment of whether current AI systems are capable of meaningful ethical reasoning and what capabilities they would need to develop to achieve this capacity.
