### Mini Description

Analysis of when and how AI systems should defer to human moral judgment versus developing independent ethical conclusions under meta-ethical uncertainty.

### Description

Moral deference in AI systems explores when and how artificial agents should defer to human moral judgment versus developing their own ethical conclusions. This involves balancing the potential benefits of AI systems' enhanced reasoning capabilities against the wisdom embedded in human moral intuitions and philosophical traditions. The challenge is particularly complex given that humans often disagree on moral issues, and human moral intuitions may themselves be flawed or biased.

A key consideration is the development of appropriate deference mechanisms that allow AI systems to learn from human moral judgments while maintaining the ability to identify potential errors or inconsistencies in human reasoning. This includes questions of how to aggregate diverse human moral opinions, how to weigh expert versus popular moral judgments, and how to handle cases where human moral intuitions conflict with logical ethical arguments. Researchers must also consider how to prevent excessive deference from leading to moral stagnation or the perpetuation of historical ethical mistakes.

The field also examines how moral deference should evolve as AI systems become more sophisticated. This includes developing frameworks for graduated autonomy in moral reasoning, where systems might initially defer strongly to human judgment but gradually develop more independent ethical reasoning capabilities as their understanding grows. Critical questions include how to maintain appropriate levels of deference while allowing for moral learning and growth, and how to ensure that systems remain corrigible even as they develop sophisticated ethical reasoning capabilities.
