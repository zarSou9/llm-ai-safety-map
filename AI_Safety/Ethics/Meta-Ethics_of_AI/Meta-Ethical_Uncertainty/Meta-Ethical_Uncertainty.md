### Mini Description

Research on how to handle uncertainty about fundamental meta-ethical questions when developing AI systems, including approaches to moral realism vs. anti-realism in the context of artificial minds.

### Description

Meta-ethical uncertainty in AI systems addresses the fundamental challenge of developing artificial agents that must operate and make decisions while lacking certainty about the nature of ethics itself. This uncertainty spans multiple levels, from questions about moral realism versus anti-realism to uncertainties about how different cognitive architectures might approach moral reasoning. The challenge is particularly acute because AI systems must be designed to make decisions even while these deep philosophical questions remain unresolved.

A key focus is developing frameworks and methodologies for AI systems to reason about and act under meta-ethical uncertainty. This includes approaches for representing and updating beliefs about different meta-ethical theories, methods for making decisions that remain robust across various meta-ethical frameworks, and techniques for learning from and incorporating new ethical insights while maintaining coherence with existing moral beliefs. Researchers explore how to balance between different meta-ethical positions and how to avoid premature philosophical lock-in.

The field also investigates the practical implications of meta-ethical uncertainty for AI alignment and value learning. This includes questions about how to design AI systems that can appropriately defer to human moral judgment while maintaining the capacity to recognize potential flaws in human moral reasoning, and how to ensure AI systems remain corrigible and open to moral learning even as they develop their own ethical understanding. These considerations directly influence approaches to AI safety and the development of robust alignment strategies.
