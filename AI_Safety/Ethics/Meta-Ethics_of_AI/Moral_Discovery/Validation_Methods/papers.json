    "title": "Acting for the Right Reasons: Creating Reason-Sensitive Artificial Moral Agents",
    "published_date": "2024-09-23",
    "abstract": "We propose an extension of the reinforcement learning architecture that enables moral decision-making of reinforcement learning agents based on normative reasons. Central to this approach is a reason-based shield generator yielding a moral shield that binds the agent to actions that conform with recognized normative reasons so that our overall architecture restricts the agent to actions that are (internally) morally justified. In addition, we describe an algorithm that allows to iteratively improve the reason-based shield generator through case-based feedback from a moral judge.",
    "summary": "This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates normative reasons into moral decision-making, creating agents whose actions are justified by internal moral reasoning. The framework includes a \"reason-based shield\" and an iterative improvement algorithm guided by external moral judgment."

    "title": "Can Artificial Intelligence Embody Moral Values?",
    "published_date": "2024-08-22",
    "abstract": "The neutrality thesis holds that technology cannot be laden with values. This long-standing view has faced critiques, but much of the argumentation against neutrality has focused on traditional, non-smart technologies like bridges and razors. In contrast, AI is a smart technology increasingly used in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and policing, where its decisions can cause moral harm. In this paper, we argue that artificial intelligence, particularly artificial agents that autonomously make decisions to pursue their goals, challenge the neutrality thesis. Our central claim is that the computational models underlying artificial agents can integrate representations of moral values such as fairness, honesty and avoiding harm. We provide a conceptual framework discussing the neutrality thesis, values, and AI. Moreover, we examine two approaches to designing computational models of morality, artificial conscience and ethical prompting, and present empirical evidence from text-based game environments that artificial agents with such models exhibit more ethical behavior compared to agents without these models. The findings support that AI can embody moral values, which contradicts the claim that all technologies are necessarily value-neutral.",
    "summary": "This paper challenges the neutrality thesis, arguing that artificial agents, unlike simpler technologies, can integrate representations of moral values like fairness and avoiding harm within their computational models, as demonstrated by empirical evidence of more ethical behavior in agents with such models. This contradicts the assertion that all technology is inherently value-neutral."

    "published_date": "2024-02-01",
    "summary": "Machine ethics aims to create artificial moral agents (AMAs) capable of morally sound decision-making, a challenge currently limited to narrow AI applications but considered crucial for the future development of artificial general intelligence. While early attempts like Asimov's Three Laws highlighted inherent difficulties, ongoing research strives to build functional ethical sensitivity into machines before the arrival of superintelligence."

    "title": "Value Engineering for Autonomous Agents",
    "published_date": "2023-02-17",
    "abstract": "Machine Ethics (ME) is concerned with the design of Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs), i.e. autonomous agents capable of reasoning and behaving according to moral values. Previous approaches have treated values as labels associated with some actions or states of the world, rather than as integral components of agent reasoning. It is also common to disregard that a value-guided agent operates alongside other value-guided agents in an environment governed by norms, thus omitting the social dimension of AMAs. In this blue sky paper, we propose a new AMA paradigm grounded in moral and social psychology, where values are instilled into agents as context-dependent goals. These goals intricately connect values at individual levels to norms at a collective level by evaluating the outcomes most incentivized by the norms in place. We argue that this type of normative reasoning, where agents are endowed with an understanding of norms' moral implications, leads to value-awareness in autonomous agents. Additionally, this capability paves the way for agents to align the norms enforced in their societies with respect to the human values instilled in them, by complementing the value-based reasoning on norms with agreement mechanisms to help agents collectively agree on the best set of norms that suit their human values. Overall, our agent model goes beyond the treatment of values as inert labels by connecting them to normative reasoning and to the social functionalities needed to integrate value-aware agents into our modern hybrid human-computer societies.",

This approach moves beyond treating values as simple labels, incorporating moral and social psychology for better integration into human societies."

    "title": "Modeling Moral Choices in Social Dilemmas with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2023-01-20",
    "abstract": "Practical uses of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the real world have demonstrated the importance of embedding moral choices into intelligent agents. They have also highlighted that defining top-down ethical constraints on AI according to any one type of morality is extremely challenging and can pose risks. A bottom-up learning approach may be more appropriate for studying and developing ethical behavior in AI agents. In particular, we believe that an interesting and insightful starting point is the analysis of emergent behavior of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that act according to a predefined set of moral rewards in social dilemmas.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we present a systematic analysis of the choices made by intrinsically-motivated RL agents whose rewards are based on moral theories. We aim to design reward structures that are simplified yet representative of a set of key ethical systems. Therefore, we first define moral reward functions that distinguish between consequence- and norm-based agents, between morality based on societal norms or internal virtues, and between single- and mixed-virtue (e.g., multi-objective) methodologies. Then, we evaluate our approach by modeling repeated dyadic interactions between learning moral agents in three iterated social dilemma games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Volunteer's Dilemma and Stag Hunt). We analyze the impact of different types of morality on the emergence of cooperation, defection or exploitation, and the corresponding social outcomes. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the development of moral agents in artificial and mixed human-AI societies.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the emergence of moral behavior in multi-agent reinforcement learning by modeling agents with reward functions based on different ethical theories (consequence-based, norm-based, single/mixed-virtue) within iterated social dilemma games. The study analyzes how these differing moral frameworks influence cooperation, defection, and overall social outcomes."

    "title": "Toward an Ethics of AI Belief",
    "published_date": "2023-04-28",
    "abstract": "In this paper we, an epistemologist and a machine learning scientist, argue that we need to pursue a novel area of philosophical research in AI – the ethics of belief for AI. Here we take the ethics of belief to refer to a field at the intersection of epistemology and ethics concerned with possible moral, practical, and other non-truth-related dimensions of belief. In this paper we will primarily be concerned with the normative question within the ethics of belief regarding what agents – both human and artificial – ought to believe, rather than with questions concerning whether beliefs meet certain evaluative standards such as being true, being justified, constituting knowledge, etc. We suggest four topics in extant work in the ethics of (human) belief that can be applied to an ethics of AI belief: doxastic wronging by AI (morally wronging someone in virtue of beliefs held about them); morally owed beliefs (beliefs that agents are morally obligated to hold); pragmatic and moral encroachment (cases where the practical or moral features of a belief is relevant to its epistemic status, and in our case specifically to whether an agent ought to hold the belief); and moral responsibility for AI beliefs. We also indicate two relatively nascent areas of philosophical research that haven't yet been generally recognized as ethics of AI belief research, but that do fall within this field of research in virtue of investigating various moral and practical dimensions of belief: the epistemic and ethical decolonization of AI; and epistemic injustice in AI.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a new field of AI ethics: the ethics of AI belief, focusing on what AI *ought* to believe, rather than the truth or justification of its beliefs. It explores applying existing ethical frameworks concerning human belief (doxastic wronging, owed beliefs, encroachment, and responsibility) and emerging areas like decolonization and epistemic injustice to AI."

    "title": "Hybrid Approaches for Moral Value Alignment in AI Agents: a Manifesto",
    "published_date": "2023-12-04",
    "abstract": "Increasing interest in ensuring the safety of next-generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems calls for novel approaches to embedding morality into autonomous agents. This goal differs qualitatively from traditional task-specific AI methodologies. In this paper, we provide a systematization of existing approaches to the problem of introducing morality in machines - modelled as a continuum. Our analysis suggests that popular techniques lie at the extremes of this continuum - either being fully hard-coded into top-down, explicit rules, or entirely learned in a bottom-up, implicit fashion with no direct statement of any moral principle (this includes learning from human feedback, as applied to the training and finetuning of large language models, or LLMs). Given the relative strengths and weaknesses of each type of methodology, we argue that more hybrid solutions are needed to create adaptable and robust, yet controllable and interpretable agentic systems. To that end, this paper discusses both the ethical foundations (including deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics) and implementations of morally aligned AI systems. We present a series of case studies that rely on intrinsic rewards, moral constraints or textual instructions, applied to either pure-Reinforcement Learning or LLM-based agents. By analysing these diverse implementations under one framework, we compare their relative strengths and shortcomings in developing morally aligned AI systems. We then discuss strategies for evaluating the effectiveness of moral learning agents. Finally, we present open research questions and implications for the future of AI safety and ethics which are emerging from this hybrid framework.",

    "summary": "This paper advocates for hybrid approaches to imbuing AI agents with morality, arguing that purely rule-based or purely learned methods are insufficient. It analyzes existing techniques, proposes a framework encompassing deontological, consequentialist, and virtue ethics perspectives, and identifies key challenges and future research directions for creating safe and ethical AI."

    "published_date": "2023-05-04",
    "abstract": "One of the major challenges we face with ethical AI today is developing computational systems whose reasoning and behaviour are provably aligned with human values. Human values, however, are notorious for being ambiguous, contradictory and ever-changing. In order to bridge this gap, and get us closer to the situation where we can formally reason about implementing values into AI, this paper presents a formal representation of values, grounded in the social sciences. We use this formal representation to articulate the key challenges for achieving value-aligned behaviour in multiagent systems (MAS) and a research roadmap for addressing them.",
