    "title": "Post series on \"Liability Law for reducing Existential Risk from AI\"",
    "published_date": "2024-02-29",
    "summary": "Gabriel Weil argues that adapting tort law, specifically through strict liability and expanded punitive damages, could significantly mitigate AI existential risks. This requires legal and legislative action to overcome current limitations on proving negligence and accessing punitive damages, potentially including mandatory liability insurance for AI development."

    "published_date": "2023-11-28",
    "summary": "The author argues that, akin to liability insurance mitigating risks from individual actions, AI labs should be required to purchase \"apocalypse insurance\" to cover potential catastrophic damage caused by their AI, aligning incentives and preventing reckless behavior. This approach, while not requiring a large state, is consistent with a libertarian worldview by internalizing externalities and preventing a form of theft."

    "title": "AI - AI Alignment Forum",
    "published_date": "2023-02-06",
    "summary": "Artificial intelligence alignment focuses on ensuring powerful AI systems act according to human values, preventing unintended consequences and existential risks. This involves diverse approaches ranging from narrow goals (e.g., curing disease) to broader objectives (e.g., creating a beneficial future), all addressing the challenge of aligning AI's optimization processes with human intentions."

    "published_date": "2023-02-06",
    "summary": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to machines capable of intelligent behavior across diverse domains, unlike narrow AI which excels only in specific tasks. While AGI's creation is anticipated within the next century, its potential benefits and existential risks, stemming from its potentially alien values, are widely debated."

    "title": "Artificial intelligence and legal liability: towards an international approach of proportional liability based on risk sharing",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper critically examines the allocation of liability when autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) systems cause accidents. Problems of applying existing principles of legal liability in AI environment are addressed. This paper argues that the sharing of risk as a basis for proportionate liability should be a basis for a new liability regime to govern future autonomous machines. It is argued that this approach favors the reality of parties' consent to taking the risk of unpredictable AI behavior over the technicality of existing principles of legal liability. The suggested approach also encourages transparency and responsible decisions of developers and owners of AI systems. A flowchart to clarify possible outcomes of applying the suggested approach is provided. The paper also discusses the need for harmonization of national laws and international cooperation regarding AI incidents crossing national borders to ensure predictability of legal rules governing the liability ensuing from AI applications.",

    "summary": "This paper advocates for a new international liability regime for AI accidents based on proportionate risk-sharing, arguing that this approach better reflects the inherent uncertainties of AI and incentivizes responsible development than applying existing legal principles. It emphasizes the need for international cooperation to harmonize national laws and address cross-border incidents."

    "title": "Artificial intelligence and legal disruption: a new model for analysis",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly expected to disrupt the ordinary functioning of society. From how we fight wars or govern society, to how we work and play, and from how we create to how we teach and learn, there is almost no field of human activity which is believed to be entirely immune from the impact of this emerging technology. This poses a multifaceted problem when it comes to designing and understanding regulatory responses to AI. This article aims to: (i) defend the need for a novel conceptual model for understanding the systemic legal disruption caused by new technologies such as AI; (ii) to situate this model in relation to preceding debates about the interaction of regulation with new technologies (particularly the 'cyberlaw' and 'robolaw' debates); and (iii) to set out a detailed model for understanding the legal disruption precipitated by AI, examining both pathways stemming from new affordances that can give rise to a regulatory 'disruptive moment', as well as the Legal Development, Displacement or Destruction that can ensue. The article proposes that this model of legal disruption can be broadly generalisable to understanding the legal effects and challenges of other emerging technologies.",

    "published_date": "2020-06-22",
    "summary": "This article introduces a series exploring AI applications beneficial to humanity, focusing on benefits unlikely to be produced by profit-maximizing businesses alone. The author emphasizes AI's potential positive externalities and its ability to address issues like climate change and unequal access to beneficial technologies, even when market mechanisms fall short."
