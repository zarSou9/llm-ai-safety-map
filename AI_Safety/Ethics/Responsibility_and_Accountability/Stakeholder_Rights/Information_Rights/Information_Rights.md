### Mini Description

Rights concerning access to information about AI systems, including transparency about decision-making processes, data usage, and system capabilities and limitations.

### Description

Information rights in AI systems encompass the entitlements of stakeholders to access, understand, and verify information about the AI systems that affect them. This includes rights to know when one is interacting with an AI, understand how personal data is being used, and access meaningful explanations of AI decisions. These rights are fundamental to ensuring accountability and enabling informed consent, while also addressing power imbalances between AI system developers and those affected by their decisions.

A key challenge in implementing information rights is balancing transparency with other legitimate interests, such as protecting trade secrets, maintaining system security, and preventing gaming or manipulation of AI systems. This has led to research into selective disclosure mechanisms, layered explanation frameworks, and methods for providing meaningful transparency without compromising system integrity. Researchers also explore how to make technical information accessible to different stakeholder groups while maintaining its utility.

The field increasingly focuses on proactive information rights, moving beyond mere disclosure to ensure stakeholders can effectively use and act upon the information they receive. This includes developing standards for information quality, timeliness, and accessibility, as well as mechanisms for verifying the accuracy and completeness of disclosed information. Particular attention is paid to ensuring information rights serve their intended purpose of empowering stakeholders rather than becoming merely procedural requirements.
