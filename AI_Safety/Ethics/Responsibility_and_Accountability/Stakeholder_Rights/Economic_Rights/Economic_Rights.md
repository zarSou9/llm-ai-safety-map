### Mini Description

Rights related to the economic impacts of AI systems, including intellectual property rights, rights to compensation for data or harm, and rights to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains.

### Description

Economic rights in AI systems encompass the complex array of entitlements and protections related to the economic value created, captured, and distributed through AI technologies. This includes rights regarding data ownership and monetization, intellectual property protections for AI innovations, and mechanisms for ensuring equitable distribution of AI-driven economic benefits. The field examines how traditional economic rights frameworks must evolve to address novel challenges posed by AI systems, particularly regarding the unique nature of data as both a resource and a product of AI operations.

A central challenge is determining fair compensation models for various forms of economic contribution to AI systems. This includes establishing rights frameworks for data providers, model developers, infrastructure providers, and end-users who may all contribute to and derive value from AI systems in different ways. Researchers investigate mechanisms for tracking and attributing value creation in AI ecosystems, as well as frameworks for ensuring fair compensation when AI systems build upon or learn from existing works, data, or innovations.

The field also addresses broader questions of economic justice and access rights in an AI-driven economy. This includes examining rights to economic opportunities in automated markets, protections against economic displacement, and mechanisms for ensuring universal access to essential AI-driven services. Particular attention is paid to preventing the concentration of economic power through data monopolies and ensuring that the economic benefits of AI advancement are distributed in ways that promote social welfare and economic stability.
