### Mini Description

Analysis of the rights, obligations, and protections that should be afforded to different parties affected by AI decision-making systems.

### Description

Stakeholder rights in AI systems examines the complex web of entitlements, protections, and obligations that should be afforded to various parties affected by AI decision-making. This includes direct stakeholders like system developers, operators, and end-users, as well as indirect stakeholders such as individuals whose data is used in training or those impacted by AI decisions without direct interaction. The field explores how traditional concepts of rights and responsibilities must evolve to address the unique challenges posed by AI systems, particularly in cases where automated decisions have far-reaching consequences.

A central challenge is balancing competing rights and interests among different stakeholder groups. For instance, the right of developers to protect proprietary information may conflict with users' rights to understand and challenge decisions affecting them. Similarly, the collective right to benefit from AI advancement must be weighed against individual rights to privacy and autonomy. Researchers investigate frameworks for resolving these tensions and establishing hierarchies of rights that can guide system design and deployment.

The field also addresses questions of representation and voice in AI development and governance. This includes examining how different stakeholder groups can meaningfully participate in decisions about AI systems that affect them, what mechanisms should exist for stakeholders to exercise their rights, and how to ensure marginalized groups are not disproportionately disadvantaged. Particular attention is paid to power dynamics and information asymmetries that may prevent certain stakeholders from effectively advocating for their interests.
