### Mini Description

Frameworks and methodologies for determining how responsibility should be distributed among various stakeholders involved in AI development and deployment.

### Description

Attribution models in AI safety focus on developing systematic frameworks for determining how responsibility should be distributed among the various actors involved in AI systems' development, deployment, and operation. These models must account for complex chains of causation, varying degrees of control and influence, and the inherent uncertainty in AI systems' behavior. The challenge lies in creating attribution frameworks that are both theoretically sound and practically applicable across different contexts and scales of AI deployment.

A key consideration is how to handle different types of responsibility - from direct causal responsibility to more nuanced forms of moral and professional responsibility. This includes analyzing how different stakeholders' decisions and actions contribute to outcomes, considering factors such as design choices, training data selection, deployment decisions, and oversight practices. Attribution models must also account for varying levels of knowledge, expertise, and authority among stakeholders.

Current research explores both retrospective and prospective approaches to attribution. Retrospective models focus on analyzing past events to assign responsibility for outcomes, while prospective models aim to establish clear responsibility structures before deployment. This includes developing frameworks for shared responsibility, examining how responsibility should shift as AI systems become more autonomous, and creating methods to handle cases where multiple actors' decisions interact in complex ways to produce outcomes.
