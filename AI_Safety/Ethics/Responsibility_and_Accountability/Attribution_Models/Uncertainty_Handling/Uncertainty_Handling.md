### Mini Description

Methods for attributing responsibility in scenarios with significant uncertainty about causation, system behavior, or outcome predictability, including probabilistic approaches to responsibility allocation.

### Description

Uncertainty handling in AI attribution models addresses the challenge of assigning responsibility when there is incomplete information, ambiguous causation, or unpredictable system behavior. This includes developing frameworks that can robustly allocate responsibility despite epistemic limitations about system operations, environmental conditions, and the complex interactions between multiple decision-makers and AI components. The field draws on probability theory, decision theory, and epistemology to create principled approaches for responsibility attribution under various types of uncertainty.

A central focus is distinguishing between different sources and types of uncertainty - from aleatory uncertainty inherent in stochastic systems to epistemic uncertainty from limited knowledge, and from local uncertainty about specific decisions to global uncertainty about system-wide behaviors. Researchers develop methods to quantify these uncertainties and incorporate them into attribution decisions, including techniques for uncertainty propagation through causal chains and methods for making attribution decisions robust to unknown factors.

Current research explores both theoretical frameworks and practical mechanisms for handling uncertainty in attribution. This includes developing probabilistic models that can express degrees of responsibility, methods for incorporating expert knowledge and bounded rationality into attribution decisions, and approaches for updating attribution as new information becomes available. Particular attention is paid to edge cases and corner cases where traditional deterministic attribution models break down, requiring more sophisticated uncertainty-aware approaches.
