### Mini Description

Models for handling cases where responsibility must be shared among multiple actors, including frameworks for determining appropriate distributions of responsibility in complex collaborative systems.

### Description

Collective Responsibility Frameworks address the challenge of distributing and managing responsibility across multiple actors involved in AI systems, where individual attribution becomes insufficient or inappropriate. These frameworks must account for complex interactions between different stakeholders, emergent behaviors that arise from collective decisions, and scenarios where responsibility is inherently shared rather than divisible.

A key focus is developing models that can handle different types of collective responsibility, from simple joint liability to more nuanced forms of shared moral and professional obligations. This includes frameworks for team-based development, distributed oversight systems, and multi-stakeholder governance structures. Researchers explore how different organizational structures, decision-making processes, and coordination mechanisms affect the distribution and effectiveness of collective responsibility.

Current research challenges include developing methods to balance individual and collective responsibilities, creating mechanisms for collective decision-making that maintain clear lines of accountability, and designing incentive structures that promote responsible collective behavior. Particular attention is paid to scenarios involving multiple organizations, cross-border collaboration, and public-private partnerships, where traditional models of responsibility may break down.
