### Mini Description

Methods and techniques for explaining decisions of existing AI systems after they are made, including feature attribution, counterfactual explanations, and saliency mapping.

### Description

Post-hoc analysis tools comprise methods and techniques for explaining decisions of AI systems after they have been made, without requiring modifications to the underlying model architecture. These tools are particularly crucial for analyzing complex, black-box models like deep neural networks, where the internal decision-making process is not immediately transparent. They aim to provide insights into model behavior through various lenses: from identifying important input features to generating counterfactual explanations that illustrate how different inputs would change the output.

The field encompasses both local and global explanation methods. Local methods focus on explaining specific predictions or decisions, providing detailed insights into individual cases. Global methods aim to understand overall model behavior and patterns across the entire decision space. A key challenge is balancing the fidelity of explanations with their interpretability - more accurate explanations often become more complex and harder for humans to understand.

Current research focuses on developing methods that are both mathematically rigorous and practically useful. This includes work on ensuring explanations are faithful to the original model, developing methods that are robust to adversarial manipulation, and creating explanations that are meaningful to different stakeholder groups. Important open questions include how to validate the quality of explanations, handle interactions between features, and explain temporal or sequential decision-making processes.
