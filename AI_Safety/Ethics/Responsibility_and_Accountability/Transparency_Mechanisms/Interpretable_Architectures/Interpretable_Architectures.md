### Mini Description

Design and development of AI systems that are inherently interpretable, including sparse linear models, decision trees, and attention-based networks that maintain transparency by construction.

### Description

Interpretable architectures represent AI system designs that prioritize transparency and explainability as fundamental properties rather than attempting to explain black-box systems after the fact. These architectures incorporate interpretability constraints directly into their structure and learning processes, creating models whose decision-making processes can be naturally understood and analyzed. This approach often involves trade-offs between model complexity, performance, and interpretability, requiring careful consideration of the specific use case and explainability requirements.

Current research in interpretable architectures spans multiple paradigms, from classical statistical models with clear parametric interpretations to modern neural network architectures designed with built-in explanation mechanisms. Key approaches include sparse linear models that maintain interpretability through coefficient constraints, decision trees and rule-based systems that mirror human reasoning patterns, and attention-based networks that explicitly model and expose their focus of analysis. Researchers are particularly interested in developing architectures that can maintain interpretability while scaling to handle complex tasks traditionally dominated by black-box models.

Emerging directions in the field focus on hybrid approaches that combine multiple interpretable components, architectures that can adapt their level of interpretability based on context, and systems that can generate their own explanations as part of their normal operation. There is also growing interest in architectures that can maintain interpretability while learning from streaming data or adapting to new environments, as well as designs that can provide different levels or types of explanations to different stakeholders.
