    "summary": "Biden's October 30, 2023 executive order on AI mandates various federal agencies to submit reports and develop plans regarding AI's use across sectors, with deadlines ranging from 30 to 90 days, focusing on responsible development, talent acquisition, risk mitigation, and addressing potential biases. The order also initiates longer-term projects like establishing an AI talent task force and pilot programs for AI research."

    "published_date": "2022-09-11",
    "summary": "Due to survival bias, we underestimate the likelihood and proximity of climate tipping points, making Earth more vulnerable to human-caused climate catastrophe. This \"anthropic fragility\" suggests a higher probability of runaway global warming and necessitates urgent geoengineering research."

    "title": "Cross-Border Cooperation Between Securities Regulators",
    "abstract": "The events of September 11, 2001, prompted sweeping cross-border coordination efforts for securities regulators around the globe. After 9/11, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) forged a nonbinding arrangement—the Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Consultation and Cooperation and the Exchange of Information (MMoU)—that standardized the protocol for information sharing among participating securities regulators. Because regulators from different countries entered the MMoU at different times, their enlistments created a set of staggered shocks. I use these shocks to show that the resulting cross-border cooperation (a) increases cross-border enforcement and (b) reduces the cost of liquidity provision in the capital markets of participating countries. These results support the conclusion that the MMoU helps fill gaps in cross-border regulation that historically exposed investors to information asymmetry, agency costs, and expropriation risks.",

    "title": "Rethinking Coordination in Large-Scale Software Development",
    "abstract": "Coordination was early identified as a key challenge in software development, and in particular in large development projects. With the arrival of agile methods and their increasing use also in large-scale projects, this calls for rethinking how the software engineering community addresses coordination. We argue for increasing the focus on coordination in software engineering and describe four directions for research. Focus on these areas can supplement advice given in current development methods with relevant research-based advice.",

    "title": "Institutional Legitimacy and Geoengineering Governance",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT There is general agreement amongst those involved in the normative discussion about geoengineering that if we are to move forward with significant research, development, and certainly any future deployment, legitimate governance is a must. However, while we agree that the abstract concept of legitimacy ought to guide geoengineering governance, agreement surrounding the appropriate conception of legitimacy has yet to emerge. Relying upon Allen Buchanan's metacoordination view of institutional legitimacy, this paper puts forward a conception of legitimacy appropriate for geoengineering governance, outlining five normative criteria an institution ought to fulfill if it is to justifiably coordinate our action around geoengineering.",

    "published_date": "2018-11-06",
    "summary": "Nick Bostrom's \"Vulnerable World Hypothesis\" posits that continued technological development significantly increases the likelihood of civilizational collapse unless global governance drastically improves. This risk stems from various technological vulnerabilities, ranging from easily accessible destructive technologies to the unintended consequences of seemingly benign innovations, necessitating stronger preventive measures and international cooperation."
