### Mini Description

Methods for comparing, weighing, and combining different moral theories or frameworks when making decisions under moral uncertainty.

### Description

Moral theory integration focuses on developing systematic approaches to combine and reconcile different ethical frameworks within AI decision-making systems. This involves creating formal methods to compare and aggregate various moral theories, such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics, while preserving their essential insights and handling their inherent tensions. The challenge extends beyond simple weighted averaging to address fundamental questions about how different moral frameworks can inform each other and contribute to more robust ethical reasoning.

Key technical challenges include developing common representational frameworks that can capture diverse moral theories without losing their distinctive features, creating principled methods for resolving conflicts between theories, and ensuring that the integration process remains stable under different conditions. Researchers explore various approaches, from multi-criteria decision making and preference aggregation to more sophisticated methods like moral parliament models and hybrid ethical frameworks that combine rule-based and consequence-based reasoning.

Current research questions include how to handle theories with fundamentally different decision procedures or value structures, how to maintain philosophical coherence while combining theories, and how to validate the effectiveness of integration methods. There is particular focus on developing approaches that can scale to handle multiple theories simultaneously while remaining computationally tractable and producing consistent, justifiable decisions across different contexts.
