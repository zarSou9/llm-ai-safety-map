### Mini Description

Approaches to updating and refining moral beliefs through experience, feedback, and interaction while maintaining appropriate uncertainty levels.

### Description

Learning under moral uncertainty focuses on how AI systems can update and refine their ethical understanding through experience while maintaining appropriate levels of uncertainty about moral principles. This involves developing mechanisms for systems to learn from various sources of moral information - including human feedback, observed behavior, and philosophical reasoning - while avoiding premature convergence to potentially flawed ethical frameworks.

A key challenge is balancing the need to learn and adapt moral beliefs with the importance of maintaining appropriate skepticism and uncertainty. This requires careful consideration of how to weight different sources of moral information, how to detect and handle potentially corrupted or biased feedback, and how to maintain robustness against value drift during the learning process. Researchers explore various approaches including inverse reinforcement learning from human demonstrations, active learning through moral discourse, and methods for detecting and resolving apparent contradictions in moral training data.

Current research questions include how to design learning algorithms that can appropriately distinguish between noise and genuine moral complexity in training data, how to handle potential conflicts between learned values and pre-existing moral constraints, and how to ensure that learning processes remain stable and beneficial even as systems become more capable. There is particular focus on developing methods that can learn from human moral behavior while accounting for human inconsistency and fallibility.
