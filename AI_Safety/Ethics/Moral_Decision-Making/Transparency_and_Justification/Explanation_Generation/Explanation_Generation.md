### Mini Description

Methods and frameworks for producing human-understandable explanations of moral decisions, including techniques for selecting relevant factors and generating appropriate levels of detail for different audiences.

### Description

Explanation generation in AI moral decision-making focuses on developing methods to produce clear, accurate, and meaningful explanations of ethical decisions made by AI systems. This involves identifying relevant moral considerations, structuring logical arguments, and presenting them in ways that different stakeholders can understand. The challenge extends beyond simple decision traces to include conveying moral weight, ethical principles, and value trade-offs in human-comprehensible terms.

Current approaches range from rule-based systems that can construct formal logical proofs to natural language generation methods that produce more narrative explanations. Key challenges include determining the appropriate level of detail, handling uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning, and bridging the gap between machine reasoning patterns and human moral intuitions. Researchers must also address how to maintain truthfulness while making complex ethical reasoning accessible to non-experts.

Emerging research questions focus on personalization of explanations based on stakeholder background and needs, handling explanations of decisions that involve multiple competing ethical frameworks, and developing methods to explain decisions that emerge from subsymbolic or distributed representations. There is particular interest in techniques that can generate explanations that are both compelling and faithful to the underlying decision process, while avoiding oversimplification or post-hoc rationalization.
