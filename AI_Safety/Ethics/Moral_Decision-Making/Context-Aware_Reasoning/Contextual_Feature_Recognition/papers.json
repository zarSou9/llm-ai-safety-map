    "title": "Contextuality Helps Representation Learning for Generalized Category Discovery",
    "published_date": "2024-07-29",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) by leveraging the concept of contextuality to enhance the identification and classification of categories in unlabeled datasets. Drawing inspiration from human cognition's ability to recognize objects within their context, we propose a dual-context based method. Our model integrates two levels of contextuality: instance-level, where nearest-neighbor contexts are utilized for contrastive learning, and cluster-level, employing prototypical contrastive learning based on category prototypes. The integration of the contextual information effectively improves the feature learning and thereby the classification accuracy of all categories, which better deals with the real-world datasets. Different from the traditional semi-supervised and novel category discovery techniques, our model focuses on a more realistic and challenging scenario where both known and novel categories are present in the unlabeled data. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art.

    "title": "Select2Col: Leveraging Spatial-Temporal Importance of Semantic Information for Efficient Collaborative Perception",
    "published_date": "2023-07-31",
    "abstract": "Collaborative perception by leveraging the shared semantic information plays a crucial role in overcoming the individual limitations of isolated agents. However, existing collaborative perception methods tend to focus solely on the spatial features of semantic information, while neglecting the importance of the temporal dimension. Consequently, the potential benefits of collaboration remain underutilized. In this article, we propose Select2Col, a novel collaborative perception framework that takes into account the spatial-temporal importance of semantic information. Within the Select2Col, we develop a collaborator selection method that utilizes a lightweight graph neural network (GNN) to estimate the importance of semantic information (IoSI) of each collaborator in enhancing perception performance, thereby identifying contributive collaborators while excluding those that potentially bring negative impact. Moreover, we present a semantic information fusion algorithm called HPHA (historical prior hybrid attention), which integrates multi-scale attention and short-term attention modules to capture the IoSI in feature representation from the spatial and temporal dimensions respectively, and assigns IoSI-consistent weights for efficient fusion of information from selected collaborators. Extensive experiments on three open datasets demonstrate that our proposed Select2Col significantly improves the perception performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "summary": "Select2Col is a collaborative perception framework that improves upon existing methods by considering both spatial and temporal importance of semantic information, using a graph neural network to select helpful collaborators and a hybrid attention mechanism to efficiently fuse their data.

    "title": "Ethosight: A Reasoning-Guided Iterative Learning System for Nuanced Perception based on Joint-Embedding&Contextual Label Affinity",
    "published_date": "2023-07-20",
    "abstract": "Traditional computer vision models often necessitate extensive data acquisition, annotation, and validation. These models frequently struggle in real-world applications, resulting in high false positive and negative rates, and exhibit poor adaptability to new scenarios, often requiring costly retraining. To address these issues, we present Ethosight, a flexible and adaptable zero-shot video analytics system. Ethosight begins from a clean slate based on user-defined video analytics, specified through natural language or keywords, and leverages joint embedding models and reasoning mechanisms informed by ontologies such as WordNet and ConceptNet. Ethosight operates effectively on low-cost edge devices and supports enhanced runtime adaptation, thereby offering a new approach to continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting. We provide empirical validation of Ethosight's promising effectiveness across diverse and complex use cases, while highlighting areas for further improvement. A significant contribution of this work is the release of all source code and datasets to enable full reproducibility and to foster further innovation in both the research and commercial domains.",
    "summary": "Ethosight is a zero-shot video analytics system using joint embedding and reasoning to perform nuanced perception from user-defined natural language instructions, overcoming limitations of traditional computer vision models through continuous learning and adaptability on low-cost devices. Its source code and datasets are publicly available to promote reproducibility and further research."

    "title": "Multi-scale Context-aware Network with Transformer for Gait Recognition",
    "published_date": "2022-04-07",
    "abstract": "Although gait recognition has drawn increasing research attention recently, since the silhouette differences are quite subtle in spatial domain, temporal feature representation is crucial for gait recognition. Inspired by the observation that humans can distinguish gaits of different subjects by adaptively focusing on clips of varying time scales, we propose a multi-scale context-aware network with transformer (MCAT) for gait recognition. MCAT generates temporal features across three scales, and adaptively aggregates them using contextual information from both local and global perspectives. Specifically, MCAT contains an adaptive temporal aggregation (ATA) module that performs local relation modeling followed by global relation modeling to fuse the multi-scale features. Besides, in order to remedy the spatial feature corruption resulting from temporal operations, MCAT incorporates a salient spatial feature learning (SSFL) module to select groups of discriminative spatial features. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance. Concretely, we achieve rank-1 accuracies of 98.7%, 96.2% and 88.7% under normal walking, bag-carrying and coat-wearing conditions on CASIA-B, 97.5% on OU-MVLP and 50.6% on GREW. The source code will be available at https://github.com/zhuduowang/MCAT.git.",

    "title": "Contexts and Context-awareness Revisited from an Intelligent Environments Perspective",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Context is a useful concept somehow unconsciously used by humans in daily life problem-solving. Recently, several subareas of computer science have been increasingly trying to rely on this concept to design systems with practical use in certain predefined circumstances. The perception is that imbuing in the system certain context-awareness qualities can support intelligent decision-making in specific practical situations. Despite a significant number of implemented systems that aim at providing context-awareness, there is a lack of commonly accepted and used methodologies and tools. At the root of this, is the lack of agreement on a set of good principles or standards, which can act as a guide to the scientific community and the developers interested in this class of systems. There have been some extensive surveys on the use of context, still there is no theoretical corpus emerging that we can use to discuss the essential concepts making up the fabric of contexts and its use by system developers. Here we attempted such enterprise at a level, which is more formal than popular surveys, in a way that is not implementation dependent and in a way that highlights key concepts of relevance to developers. We reassessed first the basic concepts identifying the need to more prominently consider system beneficiaries' satisfaction. We then transfer explicitly these values to a more formal outline of the basic componentgs and the operations which emerge as relevant. We identify and highlight the tasks of context activation, comparison, influence, construction, and interaction. We hint at how these may work in practice and explained these through examples. We show how the theory is flexible enough by generalizing it to multiusers so that optimization of global preferences and expectations is used to drive system development and system behavior.",

    "abstract": "Because of the growing interest for mobile device and pervasive applications deployed on cloud computing, the providing of intelligent and ubiquitous context-aware applications that take into account the user's context is one of the main challenges in future applications. In this article we consider how to augment applications aware context used by mobiles device and deployed on cloud computing. The behavior of these applications should depend not only on their internal state and user interactions but also on the context sensed during their execution. Indeed, our approach based on two essential mechanisms, context sensoring and context reasoning. We consider the information acquired by the context sensoring as a product line and we use feature models to represent this information received, the services provided by cloud provider, the available resources and constraints. At the context reasoning step, the context provisioning feature model (CSCAFM) algorithm permits to generate service context-aware that fulfils the requirements of use ensures a certain level of performance of resources.",
