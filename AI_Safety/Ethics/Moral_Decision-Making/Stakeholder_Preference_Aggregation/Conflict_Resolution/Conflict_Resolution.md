### Mini Description

Techniques for identifying, analyzing, and resolving conflicts between competing stakeholder preferences and interests.

### Description

Conflict resolution in stakeholder preference aggregation focuses on systematically identifying, analyzing, and addressing conflicts that arise when different stakeholders hold incompatible preferences or competing interests regarding AI system behavior. These conflicts can range from simple binary disagreements to complex multi-stakeholder tensions involving varying degrees of preference intensity, different temporal horizons, and fundamentally incompatible value systems.

Key approaches include formal methods for conflict detection using preference inconsistency analysis, game-theoretic models of strategic interactions, and techniques from dispute resolution theory adapted to AI contexts. Researchers explore both automated resolution mechanisms, such as preference relaxation and compromise generation algorithms, and hybrid approaches that incorporate human mediation and deliberative processes. Special attention is given to distinguishing between different types of conflicts, from those arising from misunderstandings or incomplete information to fundamental value disagreements that require careful trade-off analysis.

Current research challenges include developing scalable methods for handling conflicts in high-dimensional preference spaces, incorporating uncertainty and dynamic preferences into resolution frameworks, and ensuring that resolution mechanisms remain robust against strategic manipulation. There is particular interest in approaches that can preserve stakeholder autonomy while facilitating constructive compromise, and in methods that can appropriately handle conflicts involving indirect stakeholders or future generations.
