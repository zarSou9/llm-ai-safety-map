    "published_date": "2024-02-01",
    "summary": "Knuth's up-arrow notation provides a concise way to represent extremely large numbers, exemplified by 3^^^3, which despite being easily describable, represents an exponential tower of threes far exceeding the number of atoms in the observable universe. This highlights the difference between a number's description length and its magnitude."

    "title": "Representing and Reasoning with Multi-Stakeholder Qualitative Preference Queries",
    "published_date": "2023-07-30",
    "abstract": "Many decision-making scenarios, e.g., public policy, healthcare, business, and disaster response, require accommodating the preferences of multiple stakeholders. We offer the first formal treatment of reasoning with multi-stakeholder qualitative preferences in a setting where stakeholders express their preferences in a qualitative preference language, e.g., CP-net, CI-net, TCP-net, CP-Theory. We introduce a query language for expressing queries against such preferences over sets of outcomes that satisfy specified criteria, e.g., $\\mlangpref{\\psi_1}{\\psi_2}{A}$ (read loosely as the set of outcomes satisfying $\\psi_1$ that are preferred over outcomes satisfying $\\psi_2$ by a set of stakeholders $A$). Motivated by practical application scenarios, we introduce and analyze several alternative semantics for such queries, and examine their interrelationships. We provide a provably correct algorithm for answering multi-stakeholder qualitative preference queries using model checking in alternation-free $\\mu$-calculus. We present experimental results that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

    "title": "Group decision making with q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy preference relations",
    "published_date": "2022-03-30",
    "abstract": "： This paper mainly studies group decision making (GDM) problem based on q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy preference relations (q-ROHFPRs). First, Based on q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy sets (q-ROHFSs), the definitions of q-ROHFPR and additive consistent q-ROHFPR are introduced. However, the ideal state of complete consistency does not exist in real life. In order to better judge whether the decision maker's preference matrix satisfies consistency, the consistency index of q-ROHFPR is used to judge whether the matrix of q-ROHFPR is acceptable. For the q-ROHFPR matrix that does not meet the acceptable consistency, two optimization models are established for deriving the acceptably additive consistent q-ROHFPRs. In order to make the q-ROHFPR matrix of decision makers still satisfy the consistency after aggregation, this paper extends the q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric average operator (q-ROHFWGA). At the same time, in order to verify whether decision makers can reach consensus after aggregation, a consensus index based on distance is offered. Based on this consensus index, an optimization model that satisfies consistency and consensus is constructed to solve the priority vector, and develop a consistency and consensus-based approach for dealing with group decision-making (GDM) with q-ROHFPRs. Finally, the case in this paper verifies the validity and accuracy of the group decision-making model, and also verifies that the q-ROHFPR consistency and consensus management model proposed in this paper can solve the q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy preference group decision-making problem.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a group decision-making approach using q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy preference relations, addressing inconsistencies through optimization models and achieving consensus via a novel consensus index and optimization model. The method incorporates consistency and consensus measures to derive a priority vector for decision-making."

    "title": "Composite Consensus-Building Process: Permissible Meeting Analysis and Compromise Choice Exploration",
    "published_date": "2022-11-16",
    "abstract": "In solving today's social issues, it is necessary to determine solutions that are acceptable to all stakeholders and collaborate to apply them. The conventional technology of\"permissive meeting analysis\"derives a consensusable choice that falls within everyone's permissible range through mathematical analyses; however, it tends to be biased toward the majority in a group, making it difficult to reach a consensus when a conflict arises. To support consensus building (defined here as an acceptable compromise that not everyone rejects), we developed a composite consensus-building process. The developed process addresses this issue by combining permissible meeting analysis with a new\"compromise choice-exploration\"technology, which presents a consensusable choice that emphasizes fairness and equality among everyone when permissible meeting analysis fails to do so. When both permissible meeting analysis and compromise choice exploration do not arrive at a consensus, a facility is provided to create a sublated choice among those provided by them. The trial experimental results confirmed that permissive meeting analysis and compromise choice exploration are sufficiently useful for deriving consensusable choices. Furthermore, we found that compromise choice exploration is characterized by its ability to derive choices that control the balance between compromise and fairness. Our proposed composite consensus-building approach could be applied in a wide range of situations, from local issues in municipalities and communities to international issues such as environmental protection and human rights issues. It could also aid in developing digital democracy and platform cooperativism.",
    "summary": "This paper introduces a composite consensus-building process that combines permissible meeting analysis with a novel compromise choice exploration technique to achieve fairer and more inclusive solutions, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on majority-biased permissible meeting analysis. The process facilitates consensus even when initial analyses fail, offering a sublated choice as a final resort."

    "title": "Joint aggregation of cardinal and ordinal evaluations with an application to a student paper competition",
    "published_date": "2021-01-12",
    "abstract": "An important problem in decision theory concerns the aggregation of individual rankings/ratings into a collective evaluation. We illustrate a new aggregation method in the context of the 2007 MSOM's student paper competition. The aggregation problem in this competition poses two challenges. Firstly, each paper was reviewed only by a very small fraction of the judges; thus the aggregate evaluation is highly sensitive to the subjective scales chosen by the judges. Secondly, the judges provided both cardinal and ordinal evaluations (ratings and rankings) of the papers they reviewed. The contribution here is a new robust methodology that jointly aggregates ordinal and cardinal evaluations into a collective evaluation. This methodology is particularly suitable in cases of incomplete evaluations—i.e., when the individuals evaluate only a strict subset of the objects. This approach is potentially useful in managerial decision making problems by a committee selecting projects from a large set or capital budgeting involving multiple priorities.",

    "title": "Multi-criteria group decision-making method for green supplier selection based on distributed interval variables",
    "abstract": "Abstract Addressing the multi-criteria group decision making problem with interval attribute values and attribute weights, this paper proposes a decision method based on attribute distribution information. The selection of green suppliers is taken as an example for decision analysis. First, in the case of group decision-making, the quantitative values of the evaluation attributes of green suppliers are imputed by decision-makers, and the relevant distributions are constructed for each attribute. Next, combined with the ranges of attribute values, the random interval values are used to describe the information represented by each attribute to overcome the loss caused by the aggregation of individual expert information into group information. We then propose the distributed interval weighted arithmetic average (DIWAA) operator and corresponding operation rules, which realizes the fusion of qualitative data and quantitative judgment. Thus, the proposed approach allows ensuring reasonable results of the multi-criteria analysis. We also construct a ranking method for alternatives based on distributed interval comprehensive scores. Finally, we verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for the task of green supplier selection through numerical experiments.",

    "title": "Generalized Nash Equilibrium Seeking Algorithm Design for Distributed Constrained Multi-Cluster Games",
    "published_date": "2021-06-24",
    "abstract": "The multi-cluster games are addressed in this paper, where all players team up with the players in the cluster that they belong to, and compete against the players in other clusters to minimize the cost function of their own cluster. The decision of every player is constrained by coupling inequality constraints, local inequality constraints and local convex set constraints. Our problem extends well-known noncooperative game problems and resource allocation problems by considering the competition between clusters and the cooperation within clusters at the same time. Besides, without involving the resource allocation within clusters, the noncooperative game between clusters, and the aforementioned constraints, existing game algorithms as well as resource allocation algorithms cannot solve the problem. In order to seek the variational generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) of the multi-cluster games, we design a distributed algorithm via gradient descent and projections. Moreover, we analyze the convergence of the algorithm with the help of variational analysis and Lyapunov stability theory. Under the algorithm, all players asymptotically converge to the variational GNE of the multi-cluster game. Simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.",
