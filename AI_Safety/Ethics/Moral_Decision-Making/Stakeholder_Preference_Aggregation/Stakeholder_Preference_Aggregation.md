### Mini Description

Techniques for combining and balancing the potentially conflicting moral preferences and values of different stakeholders affected by AI decisions.

### Description

Stakeholder preference aggregation addresses the challenge of combining diverse and often conflicting moral preferences, values, and interests of multiple stakeholders into coherent decision-making frameworks for AI systems. This involves not only technical methods for preference elicitation and combination but also fundamental questions about fairness, representation, and the dynamic nature of stakeholder preferences over time. The field draws from social choice theory, welfare economics, and democratic theory while developing novel approaches specific to AI systems.

Key challenges include handling preference intensity and interpersonal utility comparisons, managing strategic behavior in preference reporting, and addressing power imbalances between stakeholder groups. Researchers explore various aggregation mechanisms, from voting-based approaches and preference learning to more sophisticated methods that attempt to capture nuanced value trade-offs and conditional preferences. Special attention is given to ensuring that aggregation methods are robust against manipulation and can handle uncertainty in preference specifications.

Current research focuses on developing dynamic and adaptive aggregation frameworks that can accommodate changing stakeholder compositions and evolving preferences while maintaining consistency and fairness. This includes work on mechanisms for continuous preference updating, methods for identifying and resolving preference conflicts, and approaches to balancing immediate stakeholder interests against longer-term societal impacts. Open questions remain about how to handle unknown or future stakeholders, aggregate across different levels of stakeholder expertise, and maintain democratic principles in automated decision-making systems.
