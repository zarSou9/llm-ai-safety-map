### Mini Description

Techniques and frameworks for accurately capturing and representing stakeholder preferences, including both explicit and implicit preference learning approaches.

### Description

Preference elicitation methods encompass the techniques and frameworks used to accurately capture, understand, and formalize stakeholder preferences in AI systems. These methods range from direct questioning and surveys to more sophisticated approaches like revealed preference learning and interactive preference refinement. The challenge lies not just in collecting preference data, but in ensuring its accuracy, completeness, and proper representation in a form that can guide AI decision-making.

A key consideration is handling the complexity and inconsistency of human preferences. People often have difficulty articulating their preferences explicitly, may hold contradictory views, or may express different preferences depending on context and framing. Modern approaches attempt to address these challenges through methods like active learning, multi-modal preference capture, and techniques for identifying and resolving preference inconsistencies. Additionally, researchers must consider how to handle preference uncertainty, ambiguity, and changes over time.

Current research focuses on developing more robust and scalable elicitation methods that can handle diverse stakeholder groups while minimizing cognitive burden and potential biases. This includes work on implicit preference learning from behavioral data, methods for preference decomposition and structuring, and techniques for validating and verifying elicited preferences. Open questions remain about how to handle strategic behavior, ensure preference stability, and effectively combine different elicitation approaches.
