    "title": "A knapsack for collective decision-making",
    "published_date": "2024-09-20",
    "abstract": "Collective decision-making is the process through which diverse stakeholders reach a joint decision. Within societal settings, one example is participatory budgeting, where constituents decide on the funding of public projects. How to most efficiently aggregate diverse stakeholder inputs on a portfolio of projects with uncertain long-term benefits remains an open question. We address this problem by studying collective decision-making through the integration of preference aggregation and knapsack allocation methods. Since different stakeholder groups may evaluate projects differently,we examine several aggregation methods that combine their diverse inputs. The aggregated evaluations are then used to fill a ``collective'' knapsack. Among the methods we consider are the arithmetic mean, Borda-type rankings, and delegation to experts. We find that the factors improving an aggregation method's ability to identify projects with the greatest expected long-term value include having many stakeholder groups, moderate variation in their expertise levels, and some degree of delegation or bias favoring groups better positioned to objectively assess the projects. We also discuss how evaluation errors and heterogeneous costs impact project selection. Our proposed aggregation methods are relevant not only in the context of funding public projects but also, more generally, for organizational decision-making under uncertainty.",
    "summary": "This paper models collective decision-making, such as participatory budgeting, as a knapsack problem, integrating preference aggregation methods (e.g., arithmetic mean, Borda rankings) to combine diverse stakeholder evaluations of projects with uncertain benefits. The authors analyze which aggregation methods best identify high-value projects, finding that factors like stakeholder number, expertise variation, and expert delegation improve performance."

    "title": "Algorithms for Multi-Criteria Decision-Making and Efficiency Analysis Problems",
    "published_date": "2024-06-10",
    "abstract": "Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems involve the evaluation of alternatives based on various minimization and maximization criteria. Similarly, efficiency evaluation (EA) methods assess decision-making units (DMUs) by analyzing their input consumption and output production. MCDM and EA methods face challenges in managing alternatives and DMUs with varying capacities across different criteria (inputs and outputs). That leads to performance assessments often skewed by subjective biases in criteria weighting. We introduce two innovative scenarios utilizing linear programming-based Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models to address these limitations. This dual-scenario approach aims to mitigate traditional biases, offering robust solutions for comprehensively assessing alternatives and DMUs. Our methodology allows for the influential ranking of alternatives in MCDM problems and enables each DMU to adjust its input and output ratios to achieve efficiency.",

    "title": "Participatory Budget Allocation Method for Approval Ballots",
    "published_date": "2024-10-09",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of Participatory Budgeting (PB) with approval ballots, inspired by Multi-Winner Voting schemes. We present generalized preference aggregation methods for participatory budgeting, especially for finding seemingly fair budget allocations. To achieve this, we generalize such preference aggregation methods from the well-known methods, namely the Sequential Chamberlin Courant rule and the Sequential Monroe Rule in the realm of social choice theory. Further, we provide an experimental evaluation of the preference aggregation methods using an impartial culture method of preference generation and study the extent to which such polynomial time algorithms satisfy one of the most popular notions of fairness called proportional representation.",

    "title": "Group decision making with q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy preference relations",
    "published_date": "2022-03-30",
    "abstract": "： This paper mainly studies group decision making (GDM) problem based on q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy preference relations (q-ROHFPRs). First, Based on q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy sets (q-ROHFSs), the definitions of q-ROHFPR and additive consistent q-ROHFPR are introduced. However, the ideal state of complete consistency does not exist in real life. In order to better judge whether the decision maker's preference matrix satisfies consistency, the consistency index of q-ROHFPR is used to judge whether the matrix of q-ROHFPR is acceptable. For the q-ROHFPR matrix that does not meet the acceptable consistency, two optimization models are established for deriving the acceptably additive consistent q-ROHFPRs. In order to make the q-ROHFPR matrix of decision makers still satisfy the consistency after aggregation, this paper extends the q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric average operator (q-ROHFWGA). At the same time, in order to verify whether decision makers can reach consensus after aggregation, a consensus index based on distance is offered. Based on this consensus index, an optimization model that satisfies consistency and consensus is constructed to solve the priority vector, and develop a consistency and consensus-based approach for dealing with group decision-making (GDM) with q-ROHFPRs. Finally, the case in this paper verifies the validity and accuracy of the group decision-making model, and also verifies that the q-ROHFPR consistency and consensus management model proposed in this paper can solve the q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy preference group decision-making problem.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a group decision-making method using q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy preference relations, addressing inconsistency by proposing optimization models and achieving consensus through a novel aggregation operator and consensus index. A case study validates the approach's effectiveness in handling group decisions with uncertain preferences."

    "title": "Joint aggregation of cardinal and ordinal evaluations with an application to a student paper competition",
    "published_date": "2021-01-12",
    "abstract": "An important problem in decision theory concerns the aggregation of individual rankings/ratings into a collective evaluation. We illustrate a new aggregation method in the context of the 2007 MSOM's student paper competition. The aggregation problem in this competition poses two challenges. Firstly, each paper was reviewed only by a very small fraction of the judges; thus the aggregate evaluation is highly sensitive to the subjective scales chosen by the judges. Secondly, the judges provided both cardinal and ordinal evaluations (ratings and rankings) of the papers they reviewed. The contribution here is a new robust methodology that jointly aggregates ordinal and cardinal evaluations into a collective evaluation. This methodology is particularly suitable in cases of incomplete evaluations—i.e., when the individuals evaluate only a strict subset of the objects. This approach is potentially useful in managerial decision making problems by a committee selecting projects from a large set or capital budgeting involving multiple priorities.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a novel robust method for aggregating both cardinal (ratings) and ordinal (rankings) evaluations from multiple judges, particularly useful when evaluations are incomplete, as demonstrated by its application to a student paper competition. The method addresses the challenges of inconsistent judge scales and limited individual reviews."

    "title": "Wisdom of the Crowd Voting: Truthful Aggregation of Voter Information and Preferences",
    "published_date": "2021-08-08",
    "abstract": "We consider two-alternative elections where voters' preferences depend on a state variable that is not directly observable. Each voter receives a private signal that is correlated to the state variable. Voters may be\"contingent\"with different preferences in different states; or predetermined with the same preference in every state. In this setting, even if every voter is a contingent voter, agents voting according to their private information need not result in the adoption of the universally preferred alternative, because the signals can be systematically biased. We present an easy-to-deploy mechanism that elicits and aggregates the private signals from the voters, and outputs the alternative that is favored by the majority. In particular, voters truthfully reporting their signals forms a strong Bayes Nash equilibrium (where no coalition of voters can deviate and receive a better outcome).",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a voting mechanism for two-alternative elections where voter preferences depend on an unobservable state variable, ensuring truthful signal reporting as a strong Bayes Nash equilibrium even with biased signals and contingent voters. The mechanism aggregates these signals to select the majority-preferred alternative."

    "abstract": "Abstract Addressing the multi-criteria group decision making problem with interval attribute values and attribute weights, this paper proposes a decision method based on attribute distribution information. The selection of green suppliers is taken as an example for decision analysis. First, in the case of group decision-making, the quantitative values of the evaluation attributes of green suppliers are imputed by decision-makers, and the relevant distributions are constructed for each attribute. Next, combined with the ranges of attribute values, the random interval values are used to describe the information represented by each attribute to overcome the loss caused by the aggregation of individual expert information into group information. We then propose the distributed interval weighted arithmetic average (DIWAA) operator and corresponding operation rules, which realizes the fusion of qualitative data and quantitative judgment. Thus, the proposed approach allows ensuring reasonable results of the multi-criteria analysis. We also construct a ranking method for alternatives based on distributed interval comprehensive scores. Finally, we verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for the task of green supplier selection through numerical experiments.",
