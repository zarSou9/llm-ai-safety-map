### Mini Description

Approaches to ensuring equitable representation of different stakeholder groups and handling power imbalances in preference aggregation.

### Description

Fairness and representation in stakeholder preference aggregation focuses on ensuring that AI systems' decision-making processes appropriately consider and balance the interests of all affected parties, particularly those who may be marginalized or underrepresented. This involves developing mechanisms to identify relevant stakeholders, measure and correct for power imbalances, and ensure that aggregation methods don't systematically disadvantage certain groups. The field draws from social justice theory, democratic principles, and studies of systemic bias while developing novel computational approaches to equitable representation.

Key challenges include defining appropriate metrics for representational fairness, handling intersectional identities and overlapping stakeholder groups, and balancing competing notions of fairness. Researchers explore various approaches, from statistical parity and demographic representation to more nuanced methods that consider historical inequities and structural power dynamics. Special attention is given to preventing the amplification of existing societal biases and ensuring that automated decision-making systems promote rather than hinder social justice goals.

Current research emphasizes the importance of participatory approaches that give stakeholders agency in how their interests are represented and weighted. This includes developing mechanisms for stakeholder empowerment, ensuring accessibility of preference expression methods across different capabilities and resources, and creating safeguards against manipulation or coercion. Open questions remain about how to handle proxy representation for future or indirect stakeholders, balance individual versus group fairness, and develop robust measures of representational quality that can guide system design and evaluation.
