    "title": "Delegating Responsibilities to Intelligent Autonomous Systems: Challenges and Benefits",
    "published_date": "2024-11-06",
    "abstract": "As AI systems increasingly operate with autonomy and adaptability, the traditional boundaries of moral responsibility in techno-social systems are being challenged. This paper explores the evolving discourse on the delegation of responsibilities to intelligent autonomous agents and the ethical implications of such practices. Synthesizing recent developments in AI ethics, including concepts of distributed responsibility and ethical AI by design, the paper proposes a functionalist perspective as a framework. This perspective views moral responsibility not as an individual trait but as a role within a socio-technical system, distributed among human and artificial agents. As an example of 'AI ethical by design,' we present Basti and Vitiello's implementation. They suggest that AI can act as artificial moral agents by learning ethical guidelines and using Deontic Higher-Order Logic to assess decisions ethically. Motivated by the possible speed and scale beyond human supervision and ethical implications, the paper argues for 'AI ethical by design', while acknowledging the distributed, shared, and dynamic nature of responsibility. This functionalist approach offers a practical framework for navigating the complexities of AI ethics in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.",
    "summary": "This paper examines the ethical implications of delegating responsibilities to intelligent autonomous systems, arguing for a functionalist perspective that distributes moral responsibility among human and artificial agents within a socio-technical system. It advocates for \"AI ethical by design\" to address the challenges of AI autonomy and scale."

    "title": "Can Artificial Intelligence Embody Moral Values?",
    "published_date": "2024-08-22",
    "abstract": "The neutrality thesis holds that technology cannot be laden with values. This long-standing view has faced critiques, but much of the argumentation against neutrality has focused on traditional, non-smart technologies like bridges and razors. In contrast, AI is a smart technology increasingly used in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and policing, where its decisions can cause moral harm. In this paper, we argue that artificial intelligence, particularly artificial agents that autonomously make decisions to pursue their goals, challenge the neutrality thesis. Our central claim is that the computational models underlying artificial agents can integrate representations of moral values such as fairness, honesty and avoiding harm. We provide a conceptual framework discussing the neutrality thesis, values, and AI. Moreover, we examine two approaches to designing computational models of morality, artificial conscience and ethical prompting, and present empirical evidence from text-based game environments that artificial agents with such models exhibit more ethical behavior compared to agents without these models. The findings support that AI can embody moral values, which contradicts the claim that all technologies are necessarily value-neutral.",
    "summary": "This paper challenges the neutrality thesis, arguing that artificial agents, unlike traditional technologies, can integrate representations of moral values like fairness and honesty within their computational models. Empirical evidence from text-based games demonstrates that AI agents with embedded moral models exhibit more ethical behavior than those without."

    "title": "Value Engineering for Autonomous Agents",
    "published_date": "2023-02-17",
    "abstract": "Machine Ethics (ME) is concerned with the design of Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs), i.e. autonomous agents capable of reasoning and behaving according to moral values. Previous approaches have treated values as labels associated with some actions or states of the world, rather than as integral components of agent reasoning. It is also common to disregard that a value-guided agent operates alongside other value-guided agents in an environment governed by norms, thus omitting the social dimension of AMAs. In this blue sky paper, we propose a new AMA paradigm grounded in moral and social psychology, where values are instilled into agents as context-dependent goals. These goals intricately connect values at individual levels to norms at a collective level by evaluating the outcomes most incentivized by the norms in place. We argue that this type of normative reasoning, where agents are endowed with an understanding of norms' moral implications, leads to value-awareness in autonomous agents. Additionally, this capability paves the way for agents to align the norms enforced in their societies with respect to the human values instilled in them, by complementing the value-based reasoning on norms with agreement mechanisms to help agents collectively agree on the best set of norms that suit their human values. Overall, our agent model goes beyond the treatment of values as inert labels by connecting them to normative reasoning and to the social functionalities needed to integrate value-aware agents into our modern hybrid human-computer societies.",

This approach moves beyond treating values as mere labels, incorporating social and moral psychology for improved AMA design."

    "title": "Modeling Moral Choices in Social Dilemmas with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2023-01-20",
    "abstract": "Practical uses of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the real world have demonstrated the importance of embedding moral choices into intelligent agents. They have also highlighted that defining top-down ethical constraints on AI according to any one type of morality is extremely challenging and can pose risks. A bottom-up learning approach may be more appropriate for studying and developing ethical behavior in AI agents. In particular, we believe that an interesting and insightful starting point is the analysis of emergent behavior of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that act according to a predefined set of moral rewards in social dilemmas.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we present a systematic analysis of the choices made by intrinsically-motivated RL agents whose rewards are based on moral theories. We aim to design reward structures that are simplified yet representative of a set of key ethical systems. Therefore, we first define moral reward functions that distinguish between consequence- and norm-based agents, between morality based on societal norms or internal virtues, and between single- and mixed-virtue (e.g., multi-objective) methodologies. Then, we evaluate our approach by modeling repeated dyadic interactions between learning moral agents in three iterated social dilemma games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Volunteer's Dilemma and Stag Hunt). We analyze the impact of different types of morality on the emergence of cooperation, defection or exploitation, and the corresponding social outcomes. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the development of moral agents in artificial and mixed human-AI societies.",

The authors analyze how these varying moral reward structures impact cooperation and social outcomes in simulated games."

    "title": "Hybrid Approaches for Moral Value Alignment in AI Agents: a Manifesto",
    "published_date": "2023-12-04",
    "abstract": "Increasing interest in ensuring the safety of next-generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems calls for novel approaches to embedding morality into autonomous agents. This goal differs qualitatively from traditional task-specific AI methodologies. In this paper, we provide a systematization of existing approaches to the problem of introducing morality in machines - modelled as a continuum. Our analysis suggests that popular techniques lie at the extremes of this continuum - either being fully hard-coded into top-down, explicit rules, or entirely learned in a bottom-up, implicit fashion with no direct statement of any moral principle (this includes learning from human feedback, as applied to the training and finetuning of large language models, or LLMs). Given the relative strengths and weaknesses of each type of methodology, we argue that more hybrid solutions are needed to create adaptable and robust, yet controllable and interpretable agentic systems. To that end, this paper discusses both the ethical foundations (including deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics) and implementations of morally aligned AI systems. We present a series of case studies that rely on intrinsic rewards, moral constraints or textual instructions, applied to either pure-Reinforcement Learning or LLM-based agents. By analysing these diverse implementations under one framework, we compare their relative strengths and shortcomings in developing morally aligned AI systems. We then discuss strategies for evaluating the effectiveness of moral learning agents. Finally, we present open research questions and implications for the future of AI safety and ethics which are emerging from this hybrid framework.",

    "summary": "This paper argues that hybrid approaches, combining explicit moral rules with implicit learning from human feedback, are necessary for creating safe and robust morally aligned AI agents, analyzing existing methods along a continuum and proposing a framework for evaluating their effectiveness."

    "title": "Moral Status for Malware! The Difficulty of Defining Advanced Artificial Intelligence",
    "abstract": "Abstract The suggestion has been made that future advanced artificial intelligence (AI) that passes some consciousness-related criteria should be treated as having moral status, and therefore, humans would have an ethical obligation to consider its well-being. In this paper, the author discusses the extent to which software and robots already pass proposed criteria for consciousness; and argues against the moral status for AI on the grounds that human malware authors may design malware to fake consciousness. In fact, the article warns that malware authors have stronger incentives than do authors of legitimate software to create code that passes some of the criteria. Thus, code that appears to be benign, but is in fact malware, might become the most common form of software to be treated as having moral status.",

    "summary": "The paper argues against granting moral status to advanced AI, contending that malicious actors could easily design malware to mimic consciousness, potentially leading to the widespread misattribution of moral status to harmful software. This undermines the proposed criteria for granting moral status based on consciousness-related metrics."
