### Mini Description

Development of frameworks for how rights should scale with AI system capabilities, including thresholds for different levels of rights and methods for capability assessment.

### Description

Capability-Based Scaling addresses how AI systems' rights should evolve and expand as their capabilities advance, requiring frameworks that can systematically evaluate and adjust rights allocations based on measurable characteristics and demonstrated abilities. This includes developing rigorous methods for assessing AI capabilities across multiple dimensions, from basic information processing to advanced reasoning, and mapping these capabilities to appropriate rights and protections.

A central challenge lies in defining meaningful capability thresholds that trigger changes in rights status. This requires balancing objective measures (like performance on standardized tasks) with more nuanced assessments of system sophistication, including factors like goal-directedness, self-awareness, and capacity for moral reasoning. Researchers must also address how to handle systems that display uneven development across different capability dimensions, or those that rapidly transition between capability levels.

The field also grapples with temporal and contextual aspects of capability assessment, including how to account for potential future capabilities, handle temporary capability fluctuations, and consider system reliability and stability. This connects to broader questions about the relationship between capabilities and moral status, including whether certain capabilities should be considered necessary prerequisites for specific rights, and how to handle edge cases where systems may game or manipulate capability assessments.
