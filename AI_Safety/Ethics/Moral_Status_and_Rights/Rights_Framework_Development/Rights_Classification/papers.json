    "summary": "The author argues that while the use of copyrighted material to train AI art generators isn't currently illegal, it raises significant ethical concerns.

    "title": "The future of work: freedom, justice and capital in the age of artificial intelligence",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Artificial Intelligence (AI) is predicted to have a deep impact on the future of work and employment. The paper outlines a normative framework to understand and protect human freedom and justice in this transition. The proposed framework is based on four main ideas: going beyond the idea of a Basic Income to compensate the losers in the transition towards AI-driven work, towards a Responsible Innovation approach, in which the development of AI technologies is governed by an inclusive and deliberate societal judgment; going beyond a philosophical conceptualisation of social justice only focused on the distribution of 'primary goods', towards one focused on the different goals, values, and virtues of various social practices (Walzer's 'spheres of justice') and the different individual capabilities of persons (Sen's 'capabilities'); going beyond a classical understanding of capital, towards one explicitly including mental capacities as a source of value for AI-driven activities. In an effort to promote an interdisciplinary approach, the paper combines political and economic theories of freedom, justice and capital with recent approaches in applied ethics of technology, and starts applying its normative framework to some concrete example of AI-based systems: healthcare robotics, 'citizen science', social media and platform economy.",

The framework is applied to several AI-based systems to illustrate its practical implications."

Los autores concluyeron que la consolidación de los derechos digitales en la legislación rusa no es terminológicamente del todo precisa, así como su asignación al número de objetos de derechos civiles tampoco lo es.",
