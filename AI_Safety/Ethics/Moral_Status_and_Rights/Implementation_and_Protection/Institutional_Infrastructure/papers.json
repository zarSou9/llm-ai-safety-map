    "title": "Decentralized Governance of Autonomous AI Agents",
    "published_date": "2024-12-22",
    "abstract": "Autonomous AI agents present transformative opportunities and significant governance challenges. Existing frameworks, such as the EU AI Act and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, fall short of addressing the complexities of these agents, which are capable of independent decision-making, learning, and adaptation. To bridge these gaps, we propose the ETHOS (Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System) framework, a decentralized governance (DeGov) model leveraging Web3 technologies, including blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). ETHOS establishes a global registry for AI agents, enabling dynamic risk classification, proportional oversight, and automated compliance monitoring through tools like soulbound tokens and zero-knowledge proofs. Furthermore, the framework incorporates decentralized justice systems for transparent dispute resolution and introduces AI specific legal entities to manage limited liability, supported by mandatory insurance to ensure financial accountability and incentivize ethical design. By integrating philosophical principles of rationality, ethical grounding, and goal alignment, ETHOS aims to create a robust research agenda for promoting trust, transparency, and participatory governance. This innovative framework offers a scalable and inclusive strategy for regulating AI agents, balancing innovation with ethical responsibility to meet the demands of an AI-driven future.",
    "summary": "The paper proposes ETHOS, a decentralized governance framework using Web3 technologies to manage the risks of autonomous AI agents, focusing on a global registry, dynamic risk classification, and decentralized dispute resolution mechanisms. This approach aims to balance AI innovation with ethical responsibility through transparency and participatory governance."

    "title": "Fundamentals of legislation for autonomous artificial intelligence systems",
    "published_date": "2024-09-14",
    "abstract": "The paper proposes a method for defining a dedicated operational context as part of the development and deployment of autonomous corporate governance systems. The case study of autonomous board of directors systems is examined. A significant part of the operational context for the autonomous corporate governance systems consists of the regulatory and legal framework that regulates the company's operations. A special operational context for autonomous artificial intelligence systems can be defined by simultaneously formulating local regulatory documents in two versions, i.e., to be used by people and by autonomous systems. In such a case, the artificial intelligence system receives a clearly defined operational context that allows such a system to perform its functions with a required operational quality. Local regulations that take into account the specificity of operations involving individuals and autonomous artificial intelligence systems can become the foundation of the relevant legislation that would regulate the development and deployment of autonomous systems.",
    "summary": "This paper suggests creating parallel legal frameworks—one for humans and one for AI—to define the operational context for autonomous corporate governance systems, arguing this approach improves AI functionality and informs broader AI legislation."

    "title": "International Institutions for Advanced AI",
    "published_date": "2023-07-10",
    "abstract": "International institutions may have an important role to play in ensuring advanced AI systems benefit humanity. International collaborations can unlock AI's ability to further sustainable development, and coordination of regulatory efforts can reduce obstacles to innovation and the spread of benefits. Conversely, the potential dangerous capabilities of powerful and general-purpose AI systems create global externalities in their development and deployment, and international efforts to further responsible AI practices could help manage the risks they pose. This paper identifies a set of governance functions that could be performed at an international level to address these challenges, ranging from supporting access to frontier AI systems to setting international safety standards. It groups these functions into four institutional models that exhibit internal synergies and have precedents in existing organizations: 1) a Commission on Frontier AI that facilitates expert consensus on opportunities and risks from advanced AI, 2) an Advanced AI Governance Organization that sets international standards to manage global threats from advanced models, supports their implementation, and possibly monitors compliance with a future governance regime, 3) a Frontier AI Collaborative that promotes access to cutting-edge AI, and 4) an AI Safety Project that brings together leading researchers and engineers to further AI safety research. We explore the utility of these models and identify open questions about their viability.",

    "title": "International Governance of Civilian AI: A Jurisdictional Certification Approach",
    "published_date": "2023-08-29",
    "abstract": "This report describes trade-offs in the design of international governance arrangements for civilian artificial intelligence (AI) and presents one approach in detail. This approach represents the extension of a standards, licensing, and liability regime to the global level. We propose that states establish an International AI Organization (IAIO) to certify state jurisdictions (not firms or AI projects) for compliance with international oversight standards. States can give force to these international standards by adopting regulations prohibiting the import of goods whose supply chains embody AI from non-IAIO-certified jurisdictions. This borrows attributes from models of existing international organizations, such as the International Civilian Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). States can also adopt multilateral controls on the export of AI product inputs, such as specialized hardware, to non-certified jurisdictions. Indeed, both the import and export standards could be required for certification. As international actors reach consensus on risks of and minimum standards for advanced AI, a jurisdictional certification regime could mitigate a broad range of potential harms, including threats to public safety.",
    "citation_count": 19,
    "summary": "This report proposes an international AI governance system where an International AI Organization certifies state jurisdictions on their AI compliance, leveraging import/export controls to incentivize adherence to global standards. This jurisdictional certification approach aims to mitigate risks associated with civilian AI development and deployment."

    "title": "The Global Governance of Artificial Intelligence: Next Steps for Empirical and Normative Research",
    "published_date": "2023-05-19",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a technological upheaval with the potential to change human society. Because of its transformative potential, AI is increasingly becoming subject to regulatory initiatives at the global level. Yet, so far, scholarship in political science and international relations has focused more on AI applications than on the emerging architecture of global AI regulation. The purpose of this article is to outline an agenda for research into the global governance of AI. The article distinguishes between two broad perspectives: an empirical approach, aimed at mapping and explaining global AI governance; and a normative approach, aimed at developing and applying standards for appropriate global AI governance. The two approaches offer questions, concepts, and theories that are helpful in gaining an understanding of the emerging global governance of AI. Conversely, exploring AI as a regulatory issue offers a critical opportunity to refine existing general approaches to the study of global governance.",
    "citation_count": 25,
    "summary": "This paper proposes a research agenda for understanding the global governance of artificial intelligence, advocating for both empirical mapping of existing regulatory initiatives and normative development of standards for responsible AI governance. This dual approach aims to advance both AI regulation and the broader study of global governance."
