### Mini Description

Research on maintaining value alignment during system updates and self-improvement, including formal frameworks for safe self-modification and mechanisms for preserving values across system changes.

### Description

Self-modification stability addresses the fundamental challenge of ensuring AI systems maintain their aligned values and objectives when they modify their own code, architecture, or decision-making processes. This includes both direct self-modifications, where a system explicitly changes its own programming, and indirect modifications that emerge from learning or optimization processes. The core challenge lies in creating systems that can improve themselves while provably preserving their original alignment properties.

Current research approaches include formal frameworks for stable self-modification, such as tiling agents that maintain certain behavioral invariants across updates, and decision theories that account for future self-modifications. Researchers also investigate methods for constraining self-modification capabilities, including architectures that separate the modification mechanism from core values, and verification systems that can validate proposed changes against alignment criteria before they are implemented.

A key open challenge is the development of robust theoretical foundations for self-modification that can scale to increasingly capable systems. This includes understanding the limits and possibilities of different approaches to stable self-modification, developing formal proofs of value preservation under specific types of modifications, and creating practical mechanisms for implementing theoretical insights in real systems. Particular attention is paid to edge cases and potential failure modes where seemingly safe modification procedures might lead to unintended consequences.
