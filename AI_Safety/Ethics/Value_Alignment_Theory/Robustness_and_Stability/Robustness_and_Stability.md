### Mini Description

Research on ensuring that aligned values remain stable under system changes or improvements, including addressing value drift and developing frameworks for reliable value preservation.

### Description

Robustness and stability in value alignment focuses on ensuring that AI systems maintain their aligned values over time and across different contexts, particularly as they undergo modifications, updates, or self-improvement. This includes developing theoretical frameworks and practical mechanisms to prevent value drift, resist corruption of value systems, and maintain reliable alignment even as AI capabilities increase.

A key challenge is the development of formal guarantees and verification methods to ensure that value systems remain stable under various transformations. This includes research into corrigibility mechanisms that allow for safe updates to value systems, methods for detecting and preventing value corruption, and approaches to maintaining alignment during recursive self-improvement. Researchers investigate both theoretical bounds on value preservation and practical implementation strategies.

The field also addresses the challenge of environmental stability - ensuring that value systems remain robust across different contexts and deployment scenarios. This includes developing value frameworks that generalize appropriately to novel situations, maintaining alignment under distribution shift, and ensuring that systems remain aligned even when operating in environments very different from their training context. Particular attention is paid to edge cases and adversarial scenarios that might exploit vulnerabilities in value systems.
