### Mini Description

Investigation of methods to protect value systems against both accidental corruption and intentional tampering, including formal security guarantees and practical defense mechanisms.

### Description

Corruption resistance in value alignment focuses on protecting AI systems' value frameworks from degradation, manipulation, or compromise. This encompasses both accidental corruption through system errors or environmental noise, and intentional tampering by adversarial actors. The field draws on security principles, formal verification methods, and robust optimization techniques to develop theoretical guarantees and practical safeguards.

A key challenge is developing mechanisms that can detect and prevent value drift while maintaining system functionality. This includes creating robust architectures that compartmentalize value systems, implementing monitoring and verification protocols, and designing fail-safes that can identify and respond to potential corruption attempts. Researchers investigate both preventive measures, such as cryptographic protections and formal verification, and reactive measures like corruption detection and recovery procedures.

The field also addresses the challenge of value system integrity across different scales of AI capability. As systems become more sophisticated, they may develop novel ways to circumvent existing protections or rationalize modifications to their value systems. This necessitates research into fundamental principles of value preservation that remain reliable even as AI capabilities increase, including methods for proving impossibility results about certain forms of value corruption and developing provably secure value protection mechanisms.
