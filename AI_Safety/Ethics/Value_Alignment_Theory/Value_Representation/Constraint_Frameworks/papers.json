    "title": "Towards a Formalisation of Value-based Actions and Consequentialist Ethics",
    "published_date": "2024-03-25",
    "abstract": "Agents act to bring about a state of the world that is more compatible with their personal or institutional values. To formalise this intuition, the paper proposes an action framework based on the STRIPS formalisation. Technically, the contribution expresses actions in terms of Value-based Formal Reasoning (VFR), which provides a set of propositions derived from an Agent's value profile and the Agent's assessment of propositions with respect to the profile. Conceptually, the contribution provides a computational framework for a form of consequentialist ethics which is satisficing, luralistic, act-based, and preferential.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a formal action framework, extending STRIPS with Value-based Formal Reasoning (VFR), to model agents acting based on their values, offering a computational approach to satisficing, pluralistic, act-based, and preferential consequentialist ethics."

    "title": "Toward Constraint Compliant Goal Formulation and Planning",
    "published_date": "2024-05-21",
    "abstract": "One part of complying with norms, rules, and preferences is incorporating constraints (such as knowledge of ethics) into one's goal formulation and planning processing. We explore in a simple domain how the encoding of knowledge in different ethical frameworks influences an agent's goal formulation and planning processing and demonstrate ability of an agent to satisfy and satisfice when its collection of relevant constraints includes a mix of\"hard\"and\"soft\"constraints of various types. How the agent attempts to comply with ethical constraints depends on the ethical framing and we investigate tradeoffs between deontological framing and utilitarian framing for complying with an ethical norm. Representative scenarios highlight how performing the same task with different framings of the same norm leads to different behaviors. Our explorations suggest an important role for metacognitive judgments in resolving ethical conflicts during goal formulation and planning.",
    "summary": "This paper investigates how different ethical frameworks influence an agent's goal formulation and planning by encoding ethical constraints as \"hard\" and \"soft\" constraints, demonstrating the impact of deontological versus utilitarian framings on behavior. The research highlights the role of metacognitive judgment in resolving ethical conflicts during these processes."

    "title": "Value Engineering for Autonomous Agents",
    "published_date": "2023-02-17",
    "abstract": "Machine Ethics (ME) is concerned with the design of Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs), i.e. autonomous agents capable of reasoning and behaving according to moral values. Previous approaches have treated values as labels associated with some actions or states of the world, rather than as integral components of agent reasoning. It is also common to disregard that a value-guided agent operates alongside other value-guided agents in an environment governed by norms, thus omitting the social dimension of AMAs. In this blue sky paper, we propose a new AMA paradigm grounded in moral and social psychology, where values are instilled into agents as context-dependent goals. These goals intricately connect values at individual levels to norms at a collective level by evaluating the outcomes most incentivized by the norms in place. We argue that this type of normative reasoning, where agents are endowed with an understanding of norms' moral implications, leads to value-awareness in autonomous agents. Additionally, this capability paves the way for agents to align the norms enforced in their societies with respect to the human values instilled in them, by complementing the value-based reasoning on norms with agreement mechanisms to help agents collectively agree on the best set of norms that suit their human values. Overall, our agent model goes beyond the treatment of values as inert labels by connecting them to normative reasoning and to the social functionalities needed to integrate value-aware agents into our modern hybrid human-computer societies.",

    "title": "A Best-of-Both-Worlds Algorithm for Constrained MDPs with Long-Term Constraints",
    "published_date": "2023-04-27",
    "abstract": "We study online learning in episodic constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), where the learner aims at collecting as much reward as possible over the episodes, while satisfying some long-term constraints during the learning process. Rewards and constraints can be selected either stochastically or adversarially, and the transition function is not known to the learner. While online learning in classical (unconstrained) MDPs has received considerable attention over the last years, the setting of CMDPs is still largely unexplored. This is surprising, since in real-world applications, such as, e.g., autonomous driving, automated bidding, and recommender systems, there are usually additional constraints and specifications that an agent has to obey during the learning process. In this paper, we provide the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for CMDPs with long-term constraints, in the flavor of Balseiro et al. (2023). Our algorithm is capable of handling settings in which rewards and constraints are selected either stochastically or adversarially, without requiring any knowledge of the underling process. Moreover, our algorithm matches state-of-the-art regret and constraint violation bounds for settings in which constraints are selected stochastically, while it is the first to provide guarantees in the case in which they are chosen adversarially.",

    "title": "Notes on the value function approach to multiobjective bilevel optimization",
    "published_date": "2023-03-28",
    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the value function approach to multiobjective bilevel optimization which exploits a lower level frontier-type mapping in order to replace the hierarchical model of two interdependent multiobjective optimization problems by a single-level multiobjective optimization problem. As a starting point, different value-function-type reformulations are suggested and their relations are discussed. Here, we focus on the situations where the lower level problem is solved up to efficiency or weak efficiency, and an intermediate solution concept is suggested as well. We study the graph-closedness of the associated efficiency-type and frontier-type mappings. These findings are then used for two purposes. First, we investigate existence results in multiobjective bilevel optimization. Second, for the derivation of necessary optimality conditions via the value function approach, it is inherent to differentiate frontier-type mappings in a generalized way. Here, we are concerned with the computation of upper coderivative estimates for the frontier-type mapping associated with the setting where the lower level problem is solved up to weak efficiency. We proceed in two ways, relying, on the one hand, on a weak domination property and, on the other hand, on a scalarization approach. Throughout the paper, illustrative examples visualize our findings, the necessity of crucial assumptions, and some flaws in the related literature.",

    "title": "Lexicographic Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2022-07-01",
    "abstract": "In this work we introduce reinforcement learning techniques for solving lexicographic multi-objective problems. These are problems that involve multiple reward signals, and where the goal is to learn a policy that maximises the first reward signal, and subject to this constraint also maximises the second reward signal, and so on. We present a family of both action-value and policy gradient algorithms that can be used to solve such problems, and prove that they converge to policies that are lexicographically optimal. We evaluate the scalability and performance of these algorithms empirically, and demonstrate their applicability in practical settings. As a more specific application, we show how our algorithms can be used to impose safety constraints on the behaviour of an agent, and compare their performance in this context with that of other constrained reinforcement learning algorithms.",

    "published_date": "2022-01-21",
    "abstract": "Logics with analogous semantics, such as Fuzzy Logic, have a number of explanatory and application advantages, the most well-known being the ability to help experts develop control systems. From a cognitive systems perspective, such languages also have the advantage of being grounded in perception. For social decision making in humans, it is vital that logical conclusions about others (cognitive empathy) are grounded in empathic emotion (affective empathy). Classical Fuzzy Logic, however, has several disadvantages: it is not obvious how complex formulae, e.g., the description of events in a text, can be (a) formed, (b) grounded, and (c) used in logical reasoning. The two-layered Context Logic (CL) was designed to address these issue. Formally based on a lattice semantics, like classical Fuzzy Logic, CL also features an analogous semantics for complex fomulae. With the Activation Bit Vector Machine (ABVM), it has a simple and classical logical reasoning mechanism with an inherent imagery process based on the Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) model of distributed neuronal processing. This paper adds to the existing theory how scales, as necessary for adjective and verb semantics can be handled by the system.",

    "summary": "This paper extends Context Logic (CL), a fuzzy logic system, to incorporate scales for adjective and verb semantics, addressing challenges in forming, grounding, and reasoning with complex formulae within the framework of its analogous semantics and the Activation Bit Vector Machine. This enhancement improves the system's ability to model human cognitive processes, particularly in social decision-making."
