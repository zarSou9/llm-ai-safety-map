### Mini Description

Methods for formally representing uncertainty about values, including approaches to modeling moral uncertainty, meta-preferences, and confidence levels in value judgments.

### Description

Uncertainty Representation in value alignment focuses on developing formal methods to capture and reason about the inherent uncertainties in our understanding and specification of human values. This includes uncertainty about what values people hold, how those values should be interpreted or traded off, and meta-level uncertainty about the very nature of value and preference formation. The field draws on probability theory, epistemic logic, and decision theory to create frameworks that can robustly handle these various forms of uncertainty.

A key challenge is distinguishing and appropriately handling different types of value uncertainty. This includes empirical uncertainty about human preferences, philosophical uncertainty about moral frameworks, and strategic uncertainty about how values might evolve or be interpreted in novel contexts. Researchers explore methods ranging from probabilistic value functions to ensemble approaches that maintain multiple competing value hypotheses, seeking representations that can guide AI systems to act appropriately under uncertainty while remaining corrigible.

Current research emphasizes developing uncertainty representations that can support safe and beneficial AI behavior even when value knowledge is incomplete or ambiguous. This includes work on conservative decision-making under value uncertainty, methods for updating value beliefs based on new information while maintaining stability, and frameworks for reasoning about the meta-preferences that should guide how uncertainty is resolved. Particular attention is paid to avoiding failure modes where uncertainty might be exploited or lead to undesirable convergent behaviors.
