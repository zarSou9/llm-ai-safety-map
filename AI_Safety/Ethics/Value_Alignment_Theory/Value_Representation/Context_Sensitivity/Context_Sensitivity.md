### Mini Description

Approaches to capturing how values and their relative importance vary across different contexts, situations, and temporal scales.

### Description

Context Sensitivity in value representation addresses how the meaning, importance, and application of values can fundamentally shift based on situational factors, temporal considerations, and environmental conditions. This includes modeling how different contexts can alter the relative priority of competing values, how interpretation of the same value can vary across situations, and how to develop formal frameworks that can capture these dynamic relationships.

A key challenge is developing representations that can identify and respond appropriately to relevant contextual features while maintaining coherent value structures. This involves both determining which contextual factors are relevant to value judgments and understanding how these factors should influence value-based reasoning. Researchers explore various approaches including hierarchical context models, attention mechanisms that identify salient contextual features, and frameworks for reasoning about value transfer across contexts.

Current research focuses on building robust representations that can handle novel contexts while avoiding unwanted value drift or context collapse. This includes work on meta-learning approaches that can adapt value representations appropriately to new situations, formal methods for specifying contextual boundaries and transfer conditions, and techniques for maintaining value stability while allowing appropriate context-dependent flexibility. Particular attention is given to edge cases and boundary conditions where context shifts might lead to unexpected or undesired behaviors.
