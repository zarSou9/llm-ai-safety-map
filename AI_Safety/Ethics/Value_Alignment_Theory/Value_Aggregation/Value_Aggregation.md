### Mini Description

Investigation of how to combine or reconcile different value systems and preferences across individuals and groups, including handling conflicting values and developing fair aggregation mechanisms.

### Description

Value aggregation in AI alignment addresses the fundamental challenge of combining multiple value systems, preferences, and ethical frameworks into coherent decision-making criteria for AI systems. This includes developing formal methods to aggregate individual preferences into collective choices, handling conflicting values across different stakeholders, and ensuring fair representation of diverse perspectives. The field draws heavily from social choice theory, welfare economics, and moral philosophy while addressing novel challenges specific to AI systems.

A central tension exists between different approaches to aggregation: direct preference aggregation methods that attempt to find compromise solutions versus higher-level frameworks that seek to aggregate moral principles or value systems themselves. Researchers must address theoretical impossibility results from social choice theory, such as Arrow's impossibility theorem, while developing practical mechanisms that can handle uncertainty, incomplete preferences, and strategic behavior. This includes questions of how to weight different stakeholders' input and how to ensure traditionally marginalized perspectives are adequately represented.

The field also grapples with temporal and scale considerations in value aggregation. This includes how to aggregate preferences across different time periods, how to handle changing values and preferences, and how to scale aggregation mechanisms from small groups to global populations. Researchers investigate both centralized approaches that attempt to find universal solutions and decentralized frameworks that allow for local variation while maintaining some level of coherence and stability.
