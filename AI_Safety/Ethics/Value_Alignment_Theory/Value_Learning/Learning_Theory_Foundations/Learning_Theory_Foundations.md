### Mini Description

Theoretical analysis of value learnability, including formal frameworks for understanding what types of values can be learned and under what conditions learning can be guaranteed to succeed.

### Description

Learning Theory Foundations in value learning examines the theoretical underpinnings and formal guarantees of learning human values from data and interaction. This includes analyzing the mathematical conditions under which different types of values can be reliably learned, establishing sample complexity bounds, and developing frameworks for understanding the completeness and correctness of learned value representations.

A key focus is on characterizing the learnability of different value structures, from simple preference relations to complex ethical frameworks. This involves developing formal definitions of value learning problems, analyzing the computational and statistical requirements for learning different classes of values, and establishing impossibility results for certain types of value learning. Researchers investigate questions about the expressiveness of different value representation schemes and their relationship to learnability.

The field also addresses fundamental questions about the reliability and verification of value learning systems. This includes developing formal frameworks for reasoning about uncertainty in learned values, establishing convergence guarantees for different learning approaches, and analyzing the robustness of learning methods to various forms of noise or adversarial influence. Particular attention is paid to understanding the theoretical limitations of value learning and identifying necessary conditions for learning to succeed.
