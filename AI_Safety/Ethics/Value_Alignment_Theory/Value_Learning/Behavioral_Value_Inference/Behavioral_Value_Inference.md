### Mini Description

Approaches for learning values from observed human behavior in natural settings, including methods for distinguishing between true preferences and biased or irrational behaviors.

### Description

Behavioral Value Inference focuses on extracting underlying human values and preferences from naturally occurring behavior, addressing the challenge of distinguishing genuine values from cognitive biases, situational constraints, and irrational actions. This approach leverages observational data from real-world human decisions and behaviors, attempting to reverse-engineer the value systems that would explain these choices while accounting for human limitations and environmental factors.

A key challenge lies in developing models that can separate true preferences from various confounding factors, including cognitive biases, limited information, social pressures, and temporal inconsistencies. Researchers must design inference mechanisms that can identify when observed behavior reflects genuine values versus when it stems from limitations in human decision-making or external constraints. This includes developing techniques for aggregating behavioral data across different contexts and time periods to build more robust value models.

The field also grapples with questions of generalization and transfer, seeking to understand how values inferred from behavior in one context can inform understanding of preferences in novel situations. This involves both theoretical work in understanding the relationship between values and their behavioral manifestations, and practical approaches to filtering and weighting behavioral evidence based on its reliability and relevance. Particular attention is paid to handling edge cases, rare events, and apparently contradictory behaviors that might reveal important aspects of human value systems.
