### Mini Description

Study of methods for AI systems to learn human values from various forms of interaction and feedback, including inverse reinforcement learning, preference learning, and other approaches to inferring values from behavior.

### Description

Value Learning focuses on developing methods for AI systems to learn, understand, and internalize human values through various forms of interaction and observation. This includes approaches ranging from inverse reinforcement learning and preference learning to more complex frameworks that attempt to infer deeper ethical principles and value structures from human behavior and feedback. The field grapples with fundamental challenges such as the complexity of human value systems, the difficulty of inferring true preferences from potentially inconsistent behaviors, and the need to account for human biases and irrationality.

A key area of research involves developing robust learning architectures that can effectively generalize from limited examples while avoiding overfitting to specific contexts or behaviors. This includes work on uncertainty quantification in value learning, methods for active learning that efficiently query humans for valuable information, and techniques for combining multiple sources of value information such as demonstrations, preferences, and explicit feedback. Researchers must also address challenges related to scalability, sample efficiency, and the potential for manipulation or gaming of learning mechanisms.

The field also explores theoretical frameworks for understanding the learning process itself, including questions about the learnability of various types of values, the relationship between learned values and their behavioral manifestations, and the conditions under which value learning can be considered reliable or complete. This includes investigation of formal guarantees and safety properties for value learning systems, as well as methods for detecting and correcting misaligned learned values before they lead to harmful behaviors.
