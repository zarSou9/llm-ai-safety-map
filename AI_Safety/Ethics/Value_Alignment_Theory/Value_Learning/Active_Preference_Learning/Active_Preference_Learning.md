### Mini Description

Techniques for efficiently querying humans about their preferences and values, including methods for selecting maximally informative queries and managing the cognitive load on human teachers.

### Description

Active Preference Learning focuses on developing methods for AI systems to efficiently and accurately learn human preferences through strategic interaction. Unlike passive approaches that rely on existing data, active learning methods dynamically select queries or scenarios to present to human teachers, optimizing the information gained while minimizing the cognitive burden and time requirements placed on humans.

A central challenge is the design of query selection strategies that balance multiple competing objectives: maximizing information gain, managing uncertainty, ensuring robust generalization, and maintaining human engagement. Researchers must address issues such as query diversity, cognitive load management, and the potential for human inconsistency or fatigue. This includes developing adaptive questioning strategies that can adjust to individual human capabilities and preferences while detecting and accounting for potential biases or errors in responses.

The field also grapples with theoretical questions about query optimization and sample complexity, including bounds on the number of queries needed to achieve desired levels of confidence in learned preferences. Recent work has expanded to include multi-agent scenarios where preferences must be learned from multiple teachers, methods for handling complex or hierarchical preference structures, and techniques for active learning in high-dimensional or continuous spaces where the space of possible queries is vast.
