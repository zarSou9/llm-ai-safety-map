### Mini Description

Study of how to identify, formalize, and encode human values and ethical principles into AI systems, including handling moral uncertainty and conflicts between different value systems.

### Description

Value Alignment Theory explores the fundamental challenge of ensuring AI systems pursue objectives and exhibit behaviors that align with human values and intentions. This involves both theoretical frameworks for understanding and representing human values, as well as practical approaches to encoding these values into AI systems. The field grapples with questions of value specification, aggregation of different value systems, and the philosophical foundations of what constitutes 'alignment'.

A central challenge is the complexity and diversity of human values across individuals and cultures. Researchers must address how to handle moral uncertainty, resolve conflicts between competing values, and develop robust methods for learning and representing value systems that can generalize across contexts. This includes understanding how values can be learned from human preferences and behavior, while accounting for human biases and inconsistencies.

The field also examines the stability and robustness of value systems in AI as capabilities increase. This includes ensuring that aligned values remain stable under self-improvement, developing frameworks for corrigibility and value learning that remain reliable as systems become more capable, and addressing potential failure modes where seemingly aligned systems might optimize for proxy objectives in harmful ways. Researchers investigate both direct approaches to specifying values and indirect approaches that might allow AI systems to learn or infer human values.
