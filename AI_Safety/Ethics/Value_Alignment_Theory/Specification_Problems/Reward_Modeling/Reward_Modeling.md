### Mini Description

Research on designing reward functions and objective specifications that accurately capture intended goals while avoiding unintended optimization behaviors or loopholes.

### Description

Reward modeling focuses on designing and implementing reward functions that accurately guide AI systems toward desired behaviors while avoiding misalignment through specification errors or optimization artifacts. This encompasses both theoretical frameworks for representing rewards and practical techniques for learning and implementing reward functions that reliably capture intended objectives.

A central challenge is the reward specification-implementation gap: the difficulty of translating high-level human preferences and values into precise mathematical reward functions that produce intended behaviors when optimized. Researchers explore various approaches including inverse reinforcement learning from demonstrations, preference learning from human feedback, and hybrid methods that combine multiple sources of information. These must account for human inconsistency, bounded rationality, and the challenge of eliciting accurate feedback.

Current research emphasizes scalable and robust reward modeling approaches that can handle increasing system capabilities while maintaining alignment. Key areas include reward uncertainty quantification, methods for detecting and preventing reward hacking, and techniques for reward decomposition that allow complex objectives to be broken down into learnable components. There is particular focus on approaches that remain reliable as AI systems become more capable of finding edge cases or unexpected optimization strategies.
