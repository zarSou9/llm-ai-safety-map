### Mini Description

Analysis of challenges in precisely specifying human values and avoiding unintended consequences from incomplete or incorrect value specifications, including reward modeling and impact measures.

### Description

Specification problems in AI value alignment focus on the fundamental challenges of precisely and completely defining human values, preferences, and intended behaviors in ways that can be reliably implemented in AI systems. These challenges arise from the complexity of human values, the difficulty of anticipating all relevant scenarios and edge cases, and the potential for unintended consequences when specifications are incomplete or imprecise.

A key aspect of specification problems is the challenge of reward modeling and objective specification. This includes addressing issues like reward hacking, where AI systems find unexpected ways to maximize specified rewards without achieving intended goals, and the difficulty of creating comprehensive impact measures that capture all relevant aspects of system behavior. Researchers must also contend with problems of abstraction and generalization, ensuring that specified values and constraints remain meaningful and appropriate across different contexts and scenarios.

The field explores various approaches to mitigating specification problems, including formal methods for robust specification, techniques for detecting and preventing specification gaming, and frameworks for iterative refinement of value specifications. Current research emphasizes the importance of understanding specification problems as fundamental rather than merely technical challenges, recognizing that even seemingly complete specifications may harbor hidden assumptions or gaps that could lead to unintended behaviors in sufficiently capable systems.
