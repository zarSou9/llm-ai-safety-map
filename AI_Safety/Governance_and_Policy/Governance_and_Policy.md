### Mini Description

Study of coordination, institutional design, and policy mechanisms needed to guide the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. This includes global cooperation, accountability mechanisms, and regulatory approaches.

### Description

AI governance and policy focuses on developing frameworks, institutions, and mechanisms to ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI systems at local, national, and international levels. This includes establishing standards for safety testing, defining liability frameworks, creating oversight bodies, and designing incentive structures that promote beneficial AI development while mitigating potential risks.

A key challenge in AI governance is the inherent uncertainty around future AI capabilities and their implications, requiring adaptive and robust governance structures that can evolve with technological progress. This is complicated by the global nature of AI development, where different jurisdictions may have competing interests and varying approaches to regulation. Current research explores mechanisms for international coordination, methods for distributing decision-making authority, and approaches to balancing innovation with safety.

The field draws on insights from institutional design, game theory, international relations, and complex systems theory to develop practical solutions for AI governance challenges. Active areas of research include the development of monitoring and verification systems for AI capabilities, mechanisms for enforcing safety standards across borders, and frameworks for managing the deployment of increasingly powerful AI systems. There is particular emphasis on designing governance structures that remain stable and effective even as AI systems become more sophisticated and potentially harder to control.
