    "title": "An Energy Sharing Mechanism Considering Network Constraints and Market Power Limitation",
    "published_date": "2022-03-09",
    "abstract": "As the number of prosumers with distributed energy resources (DERs) grows, the conventional centralized operation scheme may suffer from conflicting interests, privacy concerns, and incentive inadequacy. In this paper, we propose an energy sharing mechanism to address the above challenges. It takes into account network constraints and fairness among prosumers. In the proposed energy sharing market, all prosumers play a generalized Nash game. The market equilibrium is proved to have nice features in a large market or when it is a variational equilibrium. To deal with the possible market failure, inefficiency, or instability in general cases, we introduce a price regulation policy to avoid market power exploitation. The improved energy sharing mechanism with price regulation can guarantee the existence and uniqueness of a socially near-optimal market equilibrium. Some advantageous properties are proved, such as the prosumer's individual rationality, a sharing price structure similar to the locational marginal price, and the tendency towards social optimum with an increasing number of prosumers. For implementation, a practical bidding algorithm is developed with a convergence condition. Experimental results validate the theoretical outcomes and show the practicability of our model and method.",

    "published_date": "2022-11-02",
    "abstract": "A large amount of data has been accumulated. with the development of the Internet industry. Many problems have been exposed with data explosion: 1. The contradiction between data privacy and data collaborations; 2. The contradiction between data ownership and the right of data usage; 3. The legality of data collection and data usage; 4. The relationship between the governance of data and the governance of rules; 5. Traceability of evidence chain. In order to face such a complicated situation, many algorithms were proposed and developed. This article tries to build a model from the perspective of blockchain to make some breakthroughs.Internet Of Rights(IOR) model uses multi-chain technology to logically break down the consensus mechanism into layers, including storage consensus, permission consensus, role consensus, transaction consensus etc. thus to build a new infrastructure, which enables data sources with complex organizational structures and interactions to collaborate smoothly on the premise of protecting data privacy. With blockchain's nature of decentralization, openness, autonomy, immutability, and controllable anonymity, Internet Of Rights(IOR) model registers the ownership of data, enables applications to build ecosystem based on responsibilities and rights. It also provides cross-domain processing with privacy protection, as well as the separation of data governance and rule governance. With the processing capabilities of artificial intelligence and big data technology, as well as the ubiquitous data collection capabilities of the Internet of Things, Internet Of Rights(IOR) model may provide a new infrastructure concept for realizing swarm intelligence and building a new paradigm of the Internet, i.e. intelligent governance.",
    "summary": "The Internet of Rights (IOR) model leverages blockchain's multi-chain technology and layered consensus mechanisms to address data privacy and ownership conflicts, enabling secure data collaboration across complex organizations. This framework facilitates responsible data usage, cross-domain processing, and the separation of data and rule governance."

    "published_date": "2021-02-02",
    "abstract": "Novel blockchain technology provides the infrastructure layer for the creation of decentralized appli-cations. A rapidly growing ecosystem of applications is built around financial services, commonly referred to as decentralized finance. Whereas the intangible concept of decentralization is presented as a key driver for the applications, defining and measuring decentralization is multifaceted. This pa-per provides a framework to quantify decentralization of governance power among blockchain appli-cations. Governance of the applications is increasingly important and requires striking a balance be-tween broad distribution, fostering user activity, and financial incentives. Therefore, we aggregate, parse, and analyze empirical data of four finance applications calculating coefficients for the statistical dispersion of the governance token distribution. The gauges potentially support IS scholars for an objective evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of token governance and for fast iteration in design-driven governance mechanisms.",

    "title": "Calculus of Consent via MARL: Legitimating the Collaborative Governance Supplying Public Goods",
    "published_date": "2021-11-20",
    "abstract": "Public policies that supply public goods, especially those involve collaboration by limiting individual liberty, always give rise to controversies over governance legitimacy. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods are appropriate for supporting the legitimacy of the public policies that supply public goods at the cost of individual interests. Among these policies, the inter-regional collaborative pandemic control is a prominent example, which has become much more important for an increasingly inter-connected world facing a global pandemic like COVID-19. Different patterns of collaborative strategies have been observed among different systems of regions, yet it lacks an analytical process to reason for the legitimacy of those strategies. In this paper, we use the inter-regional collaboration for pandemic control as an example to demonstrate the necessity of MARL in reasoning, and thereby legitimizing policies enforcing such inter-regional collaboration. Experimental results in an exemplary environment show that our MARL approach is able to demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of restrictions on individual liberty for collaborative supply of public goods. Different optimal policies are learned by our MARL agents under different collaboration levels, which change in an interpretable pattern of collaboration that helps to balance the losses suffered by regions of different types, and consequently promotes the overall welfare. Meanwhile, policies learned with higher collaboration levels yield higher global rewards, which illustrates the benefit of, and thus provides a novel justification for the legitimacy of, promoting inter-regional collaboration. Therefore, our method shows the capability of MARL in computationally modeling and supporting the theory of calculus of consent, developed by Nobel Prize winner J. M. Buchanan.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to analyze and legitimize collaborative governance policies, particularly in the context of inter-regional pandemic control, by computationally modeling the \"calculus of consent\" and demonstrating the benefits of collaboration in maximizing overall welfare despite individual liberty restrictions. The MARL approach identifies optimal policies under varying collaboration levels, providing a justification for promoting inter-regional cooperation."

    "title": "Privacy-Preserving Supervisory Control of Discrete-Event Systems via Co-Synthesis of Edit Function and Supervisor for Opacity Enforcement and Requirement Satisfaction",
    "published_date": "2021-04-09",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of co-synthesis of edit function and supervisor for opacity enforcement in the supervisory control of discrete-event systems (DES), assuming the presence of an external (passive) intruder, where the following goals need to be achieved: 1) the external intruder should never infer the system secret, i.e., the system is opaque, and never be sure about the existence of the edit function, i.e., the edit function remains covert; 2) the controlled plant behaviors should satisfy some safety and nonblockingness requirements, in the presence of the edit function. We focus on the class of edit functions that satisfy the following properties: 1) the observation capability of the edit function in general can be different from those of the supervisor and the intruder; 2) the edit function can implement insertion, deletion, and replacement operations; 3) the edit function performs bounded edit operations, i.e., the length of each string output of the edit function is upper bounded by a given constant. We propose an approach to solve this cosynthesis problem by modeling it as a distributed supervisor synthesis problem in the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control framework. By taking the special structure of this distributed supervisor synthesis problem into consideration and to improve the possibility of finding a non-empty distributed supervisor, we propose two novel synthesis heuristics that incrementally synthesize the supervisor and the edit function. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on an example in the enforcement of the location privacy.",

    "title": "Governance for Security, Risks, Competition and Cooperation: Mapping the knowledge",
    "published_date": "2021-04-13",
    "abstract": "Governance is associated with multiple ways of governing (i.e., directing, guiding, or regulating) at the national, regional, organizationalor individual levels, among several diverse and divergent definitions (Robichau, 2011). Further factors such as security and risks, competition, and cooperation, certainly fit within the governance framework-reach. For instance, research in the lines above has focused on the variation of risk-taking actions of banks with the power of shareholders within the corporate governance (Laeven & Levine, 2009), the development of 'security governance' concept to understanding the European security coordination, management, and regulation, policy framework (Webber et al., 2004), and the role of governance and competition in firms' innovation (Ayyagari et al., 2011). Such exploration leads toward a bountiful research agenda on governance and: security or risks or competition or cooperation, nurtured by multiple problems and multi-inter-transdisciplinary approaches.",

    "title": "A Regulatory System for Optimal Legal Transaction Throughput in Cryptocurrency Blockchains",
    "published_date": "2021-03-30",
    "abstract": "Permissionless blockchain consensus protocols have been designed primarily for defining decentralized economies for the commercial trade of assets, both virtual and physical, using cryptocurrencies. In most instances, the assets being traded are regulated, which mandates that the legal right to their trade and their trade value are determined by the governmental regulator of the jurisdiction in which the trade occurs. Unfortunately, existing blockchains do not formally recognise proposal of legal cryptocurrency transactions, as part of the execution of their respective consensus protocols, resulting in rampant illegal activities in the associated crypto-economies. In this contribution, we motivate the need for regulated blockchain consensus protocols with a case study of the illegal, cryptocurrency based, Silk Road darknet market. We present a novel regulatory framework for blockchain protocols, for ensuring legal transaction confirmation as part of the blockchain distributed consensus. As per our regulatory framework, we derive conditions under which legal transaction throughput supersedes throughput of traditional transactions, which are, in the worst case, an indifferentiable mix of legal and illegal transactions. Finally, we show that with a small change to the standard blockchain consensus execution policy (appropriately introduced through regulation), the legal transaction throughput in the blockchain network can be maximized.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a regulatory framework for blockchain consensus protocols to prioritize and maximize legal cryptocurrency transaction throughput, addressing the issue of illegal activities on permissionless blockchains by incorporating legal transaction confirmation into the consensus mechanism. The authors demonstrate that a small regulatory change can significantly improve the ratio of legal to illegal transactions processed."

    "title": "A Regulation Enforcement Solution for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2019-01-29",
    "abstract": "Human behaviors are regularized by a variety of norms or regulations, either to maintain orders or to enhance social welfare. However, if artificially intelligent (AI) agents make decisions on behalf of human beings, it is possible that an AI agent can opt to disobey the regulations (being defective) for self-interests. In this paper, we aim to answer the following question: In a decentralized environment (no centralized authority can control agents), given that not all agents are compliant to regulations at first, can we develop a mechanism such that it is in the self-interest of non-compliant agents to comply after all. We first introduce the problem as Regulation Enforcement and formulate it using reinforcement learning and game theory. Then we propose our solution based on the key idea that although we could not alter how defective agents choose to behave, we can, however, leverage the aggregated power of compliant agents to boycott the defective ones. We conducted simulated experiments on two scenarios: Replenishing Resource Management Dilemma and Diminishing Reward Shaping Enforcement, using deep multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. We further use empirical game-theoretic analysis to show that the method alters the resulting empirical payoff matrices in a way that promotes compliance (making mutual compliant a Nash Equilibrium).",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a decentralized mechanism for enforcing regulations in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems, leveraging the collective action of compliant agents to incentivize non-compliant agents to comply by boycotting their actions. The approach is validated through simulations and game-theoretic analysis demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving regulatory compliance."
