    "title": "Barriers on the EDGE: A scalable CBF architecture over EDGE for safe aerial-ground multi-agent coordination",
    "published_date": "2024-11-25",
    "abstract": "In this article, we address the problem of designing a scalable control architecture for a safe coordinated operation of a multi-agent system with aerial (UAVs) and ground robots (UGVs) in a confined task space. The proposed method uses Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to impose constraints associated with (i) collision avoidance between agents, (ii) landing of UAVs on mobile UGVs, and (iii) task space restriction. Further, to account for the rapid increase in the number of constraints for a single agent with the increasing number of agents, the proposed architecture uses a centralized-decentralized Edge cluster, where a centralized node (Watcher) activates the relevant constraints, reducing the need for high onboard processing and network complexity. The distributed nodes run the controller locally to overcome latency and network issues. The proposed Edge architecture is experimentally validated using multiple aerial and ground robots in a confined environment performing a coordinated operation.",

    "title": "A Secure and Intelligent Data Sharing Scheme for UAV-Assisted Disaster Rescue",
    "published_date": "2022-11-23",
    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to establish flexible and reliable emergency networks in disaster sites when terrestrial communication infrastructures go down. Nevertheless, potential security threats may occur on UAVs during data transmissions due to the untrusted environment and open-access UAV networks. Moreover, UAVs typically have limited battery and computation capacity, making them unaffordable for heavy security provisioning operations when performing complicated rescue tasks. In this paper, we develop RescueChain, a secure and efficient information sharing scheme for UAV-assisted disaster rescue. Specifically, we first implement a lightweight blockchain-based framework to safeguard data sharing under disasters and immutably trace misbehaving entities. A reputation-based consensus protocol is devised to adapt the weakly connected environment with improved consensus efficiency and promoted UAVs' honest behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce a novel vehicular fog computing (VFC)-based off-chain mechanism by leveraging ground vehicles as moving fog nodes to offload UAVs' heavy data processing and storage tasks. To offload computational tasks from the UAVs to ground vehicles with idle computing resources, an optimal allocation strategy is developed by choosing payoffs that achieve equilibrium in a Stackelberg game formulation of the allocation problem. For lack of sufficient knowledge on network model parameters and users' private cost parameters in practical environment, we also design a two-tier deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to seek the optimal payment and resource strategies of UAVs and vehicles with improved learning efficiency. Simulation results show that RescueChain can effectively accelerate consensus process, improve offloading efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and enhance user payoffs.",

    "title": "A Capability-based Distributed Authorization System to Enforce Context-aware Permission Sequences",
    "published_date": "2022-06-07",
    "abstract": "Controlled sharing is fundamental to distributed systems. We consider a capability-based distributed authorization system where a client receives capabilities (access tokens) from an authorization server to access the resources of resource servers. Capability-based authorization systems have been widely used on the Web, in mobile applications and other distributed systems. A common requirement of such systems is that the user uses tokens of multiple servers in a particular order. A related requirement is the token may be used if certain environmental conditions hold. We introduce a secure capability-based system that supports \"permission sequence\" and \"context\". This allows a finite sequence of permissions to be enforced, each with their own specific context. We prove the safety property of this system for these conditions and integrate the system into OAuth 2.0 with proof-of-possession tokens. We evaluate our implementation and compare it with plain OAuth with respect to the average time for obtaining an authorization token and acquiring access to the resource.",

    "title": "Privacy-Preserving Supervisory Control of Discrete-Event Systems via Co-Synthesis of Edit Function and Supervisor for Opacity Enforcement and Requirement Satisfaction",
    "published_date": "2021-04-09",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of co-synthesis of edit function and supervisor for opacity enforcement in the supervisory control of discrete-event systems (DES), assuming the presence of an external (passive) intruder, where the following goals need to be achieved: 1) the external intruder should never infer the system secret, i.e., the system is opaque, and never be sure about the existence of the edit function, i.e., the edit function remains covert; 2) the controlled plant behaviors should satisfy some safety and nonblockingness requirements, in the presence of the edit function. We focus on the class of edit functions that satisfy the following properties: 1) the observation capability of the edit function in general can be different from those of the supervisor and the intruder; 2) the edit function can implement insertion, deletion, and replacement operations; 3) the edit function performs bounded edit operations, i.e., the length of each string output of the edit function is upper bounded by a given constant. We propose an approach to solve this cosynthesis problem by modeling it as a distributed supervisor synthesis problem in the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control framework. By taking the special structure of this distributed supervisor synthesis problem into consideration and to improve the possibility of finding a non-empty distributed supervisor, we propose two novel synthesis heuristics that incrementally synthesize the supervisor and the edit function. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on an example in the enforcement of the location privacy.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a co-synthesis approach for designing a supervisor and an edit function to ensure opacity (hiding system secrets from an intruder) in discrete-event systems, while simultaneously satisfying system requirements and keeping the edit function's existence covert. The approach leverages the Ramadge-Wonham framework and incorporates novel heuristics to improve the synthesis process."

    "title": "Calculus of Consent via MARL: Legitimating the Collaborative Governance Supplying Public Goods",
    "published_date": "2021-11-20",
    "abstract": "Public policies that supply public goods, especially those involve collaboration by limiting individual liberty, always give rise to controversies over governance legitimacy. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods are appropriate for supporting the legitimacy of the public policies that supply public goods at the cost of individual interests. Among these policies, the inter-regional collaborative pandemic control is a prominent example, which has become much more important for an increasingly inter-connected world facing a global pandemic like COVID-19. Different patterns of collaborative strategies have been observed among different systems of regions, yet it lacks an analytical process to reason for the legitimacy of those strategies. In this paper, we use the inter-regional collaboration for pandemic control as an example to demonstrate the necessity of MARL in reasoning, and thereby legitimizing policies enforcing such inter-regional collaboration. Experimental results in an exemplary environment show that our MARL approach is able to demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of restrictions on individual liberty for collaborative supply of public goods. Different optimal policies are learned by our MARL agents under different collaboration levels, which change in an interpretable pattern of collaboration that helps to balance the losses suffered by regions of different types, and consequently promotes the overall welfare. Meanwhile, policies learned with higher collaboration levels yield higher global rewards, which illustrates the benefit of, and thus provides a novel justification for the legitimacy of, promoting inter-regional collaboration. Therefore, our method shows the capability of MARL in computationally modeling and supporting the theory of calculus of consent, developed by Nobel Prize winner J. M. Buchanan.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to analyze and legitimize collaborative governance policies, particularly in the context of inter-regional pandemic control, by demonstrating the benefits of collaboration in maximizing overall welfare and justifying limitations on individual liberty. The MARL approach computationally models and supports the \"calculus of consent\" theory, providing a novel justification for collaborative strategies."

    "title": "Structured Diversification Emergence via Reinforced Organization Control and Hierarchical Consensus Learning",
    "published_date": "2021-02-09",
    "abstract": "When solving a complex task, humans will spontaneously form teams and to complete different parts of the whole task, respectively. Meanwhile, the cooperation between teammates will improve efficiency. However, for current cooperative MARL methods, the cooperation team is constructed through either heuristics or end-to-end blackbox optimization. In order to improve the efficiency of cooperation and exploration, we propose a structured diversification emergence MARL framework named {\\sc{Rochico}} based on reinforced organization control and hierarchical consensus learning. {\\sc{Rochico}} first learns an adaptive grouping policy through the organization control module, which is established by independent multi-agent reinforcement learning. Further, the hierarchical consensus module based on the hierarchical intentions with consensus constraint is introduced after team formation. Simultaneously, utilizing the hierarchical consensus module and a self-supervised intrinsic reward enhanced decision module, the proposed cooperative MARL algorithm {\\sc{Rochico}} can output the final diversified multi-agent cooperative policy. All three modules are organically combined to promote the structured diversification emergence. Comparative experiments on four large-scale cooperation tasks show that {\\sc{Rochico}} is significantly better than the current SOTA algorithms in terms of exploration efficiency and cooperation strength.",
