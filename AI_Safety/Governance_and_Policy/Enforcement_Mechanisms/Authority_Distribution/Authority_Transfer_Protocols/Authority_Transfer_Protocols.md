### Mini Description

Frameworks for dynamically shifting enforcement authority between different bodies based on changing circumstances, escalation triggers, or evolving AI capabilities.

### Description

Authority Transfer Protocols encompass the frameworks and mechanisms for dynamically reallocating enforcement responsibilities between different oversight bodies as circumstances change. These protocols are essential for ensuring AI governance remains responsive to evolving technological capabilities, emerging risks, and varying jurisdictional needs while maintaining consistent oversight and accountability throughout any transition process.

The design of these protocols requires careful consideration of trigger conditions that initiate transfers, the mechanics of how authority and associated resources are transferred, and verification procedures to ensure the receiving body is capable of assuming responsibility. Key challenges include maintaining operational continuity during transfers, preserving institutional knowledge, and ensuring clear chains of responsibility throughout the transition process. Research focuses on developing robust criteria for determining when transfers should occur and establishing standardized procedures that can be implemented across different governance contexts.

Current work explores both planned and emergency transfer scenarios, from scheduled reassessments of jurisdiction based on AI system capabilities to rapid response protocols for critical incidents. This includes developing frameworks for partial transfers that allow graduated responses to emerging challenges, mechanisms for temporary authority delegation during crises, and systems for reversing transfers when conditions change. Particular attention is given to ensuring transfer protocols remain resistant to manipulation and capture by interested parties while maintaining sufficient flexibility to address unforeseen circumstances.
