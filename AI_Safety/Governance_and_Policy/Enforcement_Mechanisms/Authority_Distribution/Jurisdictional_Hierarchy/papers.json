    "published_date": "2018-08-12",
    "summary": "This paper advocates for the scientific and ethical study of humanity's long-term future, outlining four potential trajectories: status quo, catastrophe, technological transformation, and astronomical expansion. The authors argue that current decisions significantly impact these future possibilities, necessitating a dedicated field of study to inform policy."

    "summary": "Nick Bostrom's \"The Vulnerable World Hypothesis\" argues that continued technological advancement significantly increases the likelihood of civilizational collapse unless global governance substantially improves. This risk stems from various technological vulnerabilities, ranging from easily accessible destructive technologies to the aggregate impact of many individually minor harmful actions."

    "title": "Logic of order: state hierarchy, law, sovereignty, and war",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT While natural sciences such as physics hold causality for granted as one of the most fundamental principles to make adequate theories of the real world, social sciences, first of all, sociology have not this advantage. Of course, humans are subjected to causality insofar as they are physical entities too, but moreover they are endowed with free will that essentially complicates their behavior and social activity. Unlike causality, logistics should take the same place in social sciences. Conscious beings behave rationally and act logistically as well as they possess some physical experience (including causality) and socially structured knowledge. Thus, free will is restricted not only by causality and other physical laws but also logistics. This paper argues for a logistical approach to the society and models the state as a power hierarchy (mathematical ideal). The state can exist, function, and be stable over time only as a hierarchy. Then sovereignty emerges as a logistical phenomenon whose 'dynamical magnitude' is naturally decomposed by the societal strata of the society and the mankind as a whole. Further, any state-based legal system (SLS) can be analyzed in structuralism tradition by means of logical-algebraic modeling. When the states as a set of the self-sufficient (logistically complete) sovereign hierarchies confront in the international law field (ILF) it leads inevitably to incompleteness of the ILF. In sum, the logistical theorem on war can be elicited.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a logistical approach to social sciences, modeling the state as a power hierarchy and arguing that sovereignty and legal systems are logistical phenomena. The inherent incompleteness of international law, resulting from the interaction of sovereign states, leads to a logistical theorem predicting war."

    "title": "Hierarchies in World Politics",
    "abstract": "Abstract Hierarchy-centered approaches to IR promise to deliver what anarchy-centered approaches have not: a framework for theorizing and empirically analyzing world politics as a global system rather than just an international one. At the core of this proposition are three features of hierarchical systems as they are represented across the growing IR literature on the topic. First, the structures of differentiation at the core of hierarchical systems are deeply implicated with power. Hierarchical systems are thus intrinsically political. Second, in world politics, hierarchies stratify, rank, and organize the relations not only among states but also other kinds of actors as well, and often even a mix of different actors within a single structure of differentiation. Third, there are many different kinds of hierarchical relations in world politics, each of which generate different “logics” influencing social, moral, and behavioral outcomes. Hierarchy has been understood in the IR literature in two ways: narrowly, as a relationship of legitimate authority; and broadly, as intersubjective manifestations of organized inequality. Hierarchy operates in a variety of different ways that range from ordering solutions to deep structures. We identify three such “logics” that have been fruitfully explored in IR scholarship and that can form the basis of a future research agenda: hierarchy as an institutionalized functional bargain between actors (a logic of trade-offs); hierarchy as differentiated social and political roles shaping behavior (a logic of positionality); and hierarchy as a productive political space or structure (a logic of productivity).",

    "summary": "This paper argues that hierarchy-centered approaches offer a superior framework for understanding global politics by analyzing power structures and differentiated actor relationships within a systemic context, rather than solely focusing on anarchy. It proposes three key logics of hierarchy – trade-offs, positionality, and productivity – to guide future research."

    "title": "Population patterns in World's administrative units",
    "abstract": "Whereas there has been an extended discussion concerning city population distribution, little has been said about that of administrative divisions. In this work, we investigate the population distribution of second-level administrative units of 150 countries and territories and propose the discrete generalized beta distribution (DGBD) rank-size function to describe the data. After testing the balance between the goodness of fit and number of parameters of this function compared with a power law, which is the most common model for city population, the DGBD is a good statistical model for 96% of our datasets and preferred over a power law in almost every case. Moreover, the DGBD is preferred over a power law for fitting country population data, which can be seen as the zeroth-level administrative unit. We present a computational toy model to simulate the formation of administrative divisions in one dimension and give numerical evidence that the DGBD arises from a particular case of this model. This model, along with the fitting of the DGBD, proves adequate in reproducing and describing local unit evolution and its effect on the population distribution.",

    "summary": "The study analyzes the population distribution of second-level administrative units across 150 countries, finding the discrete generalized beta distribution (DGBD) to be a superior model compared to the power law typically used for city populations. A computational model further supports the DGBD's effectiveness in describing administrative unit population distribution."

    "published_date": "2016-02-22",
    "summary": "The author argues that the risk of a globally catastrophic bioengineered pandemic is significantly understudied and comparable in magnitude to artificial general intelligence (AGI) existential risks. Because biorisks are both imminent and easily achievable with current technology, they pose a more immediate threat to humanity than AGI, potentially even preempting an AGI-related extinction event."
