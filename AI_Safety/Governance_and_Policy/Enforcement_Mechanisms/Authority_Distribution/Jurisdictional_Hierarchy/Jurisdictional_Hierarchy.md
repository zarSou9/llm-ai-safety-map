### Mini Description

Analysis of how enforcement authority should be structured vertically across international, national, and local levels, including mechanisms for managing jurisdictional overlap and conflict resolution.

### Description

Jurisdictional hierarchy in AI enforcement examines how authority and responsibility should be structured across different levels of governance, from international bodies to local regulators. This involves analyzing the appropriate distribution of enforcement powers, establishing clear chains of command, and developing mechanisms for managing jurisdictional overlap. The field grapples with unique challenges posed by AI systems that often operate across borders while having localized impacts, requiring careful consideration of sovereignty, subsidiarity, and effective coordination.

Current research focuses on developing models that balance the need for consistent global standards with the flexibility to address local contexts and concerns. This includes exploring nested governance structures where higher-level bodies set broad frameworks and principles, while lower-level authorities handle implementation and context-specific enforcement. Key challenges include determining appropriate thresholds for escalating enforcement to higher jurisdictional levels, managing conflicts between different jurisdictional claims, and ensuring effective information flow across hierarchical levels.

Emerging frameworks must address both vertical integration (between different levels of authority) and horizontal coordination (between entities at the same level). This includes developing clear protocols for jurisdiction assignment based on AI system characteristics, impact scope, and deployment context. Particular attention is given to establishing mechanisms for managing cross-border enforcement actions, resolving jurisdictional disputes, and ensuring consistent application of standards while respecting local autonomy.
