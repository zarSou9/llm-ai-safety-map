### Mini Description

Design and implementation of testing protocols to evaluate AI system behavior, including systematic test case generation, adversarial testing, and coverage metrics.

### Description

Empirical testing of AI systems involves systematic evaluation of system behavior through controlled experiments, test cases, and real-world scenarios to validate safety properties and identify potential failure modes. This approach complements formal verification by providing concrete evidence of system performance and uncovering unexpected behaviors that may not be captured by theoretical analysis. The field encompasses both white-box testing, which leverages knowledge of system internals, and black-box testing, which evaluates system behavior solely through inputs and outputs.

A central challenge in empirical testing of AI systems is the vast input space that needs to be explored, particularly for deep learning models with high-dimensional inputs. Researchers develop sophisticated sampling strategies, adversarial testing approaches, and automated test case generation methods to efficiently probe system behavior. This includes techniques for identifying edge cases, generating challenging scenarios, and systematically exploring behavioral boundaries where safety violations are more likely to occur.

Current research focuses on developing metrics to quantify test coverage and effectiveness, creating standardized benchmarks for safety-critical properties, and designing test suites that can evaluate complex behavioral specifications. There is particular emphasis on methods for testing AI systems' robustness to distribution shifts, ability to handle corner cases, and adherence to safety constraints under various environmental conditions. The field also explores techniques for continuous testing during development and deployment, including regression testing approaches for systems that learn and adapt over time.
