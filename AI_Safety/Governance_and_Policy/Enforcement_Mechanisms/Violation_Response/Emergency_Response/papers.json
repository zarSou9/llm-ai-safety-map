    "title": "Separation Assurance in Urban Air Mobility Systems using Shared Scheduling Protocols",
    "published_date": "2025-01-15",
    "abstract": "Ensuring safe separation between aircraft is a critical challenge in air traffic management, particularly in urban air mobility (UAM) environments where high traffic density and low altitudes require precise control. In these environments, conflicts often arise at the intersections of flight corridors, posing significant risks. We propose a tactical separation approach leveraging shared scheduling protocols, originally designed for Ethernet networks and operating systems, to coordinate access to these intersections. Using a decentralized Markov decision process framework, the proposed approach enables aircraft to autonomously adjust their speed and timing as they navigate these critical areas, maintaining safe separation without a central controller. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in simulated UAM scenarios, demonstrating its ability to reduce separation violations to zero while acknowledging trade-offs in flight times as traffic density increases. Additionally, we explore the impact of non-compliant aircraft, showing that while shared scheduling protocols can no longer guarantee safe separation, they still provide significant improvements over systems without scheduling protocols.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a decentralized approach to aircraft separation in urban air mobility using shared scheduling protocols, enabling autonomous conflict resolution at flight corridor intersections and minimizing separation violations even with non-compliant aircraft, though at the cost of potentially increased flight times."

    "abstract": "A smart city solution toward future 6G network deployment allows small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), industry, and government entities to connect with the infrastructures and play a crucial role in enhancing emergency preparedness with advanced sensors. The objective of this work is to propose a set of coordinated technological solutions to transform an existing emergency response system into an intelligent interactive system, thereby improving the public services and the quality of life for residents at home, on road, in hospitals, transport hubs, etc. In this context, we consider a city wide view from three different application scenes that are closely related to peoples daily life, to optimize the actions taken at relevant departments. Therefore, using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to enable the next generation connected vehicle experiences, we specifically focus on accidents happening in indoor households, urban roads, and at large public facilities. This smart interactive response system will benefit from advanced sensor fusion and AI by formulating a real time dynamic model.",

    "title": "Barriers on the EDGE: A scalable CBF architecture over EDGE for safe aerial-ground multi-agent coordination",
    "published_date": "2024-11-25",
    "abstract": "In this article, we address the problem of designing a scalable control architecture for a safe coordinated operation of a multi-agent system with aerial (UAVs) and ground robots (UGVs) in a confined task space. The proposed method uses Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to impose constraints associated with (i) collision avoidance between agents, (ii) landing of UAVs on mobile UGVs, and (iii) task space restriction. Further, to account for the rapid increase in the number of constraints for a single agent with the increasing number of agents, the proposed architecture uses a centralized-decentralized Edge cluster, where a centralized node (Watcher) activates the relevant constraints, reducing the need for high onboard processing and network complexity. The distributed nodes run the controller locally to overcome latency and network issues. The proposed Edge architecture is experimentally validated using multiple aerial and ground robots in a confined environment performing a coordinated operation.",

    "title": "Disaster Anomaly Detector via Deeper FCDDs for Explainable Initial Responses",
    "published_date": "2023-06-05",
    "abstract": "Extreme natural disasters can have devastating effects on both urban and rural areas. In any disaster event, an initial response is the key to rescue within 72 hours and prompt recovery. During the initial stage of disaster response, it is important to quickly assess the damage over a wide area and identify priority areas. Among machine learning algorithms, deep anomaly detection is effective in detecting devastation features that are different from everyday features. In addition, explainable computer vision applications should justify the initial responses. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection application utilizing deeper fully convolutional data descriptions (FCDDs), that enables the localization of devastation features and visualization of damage-marked heatmaps. More specifically, we show numerous training and test results for a dataset AIDER with the four disaster categories: collapsed buildings, traffic incidents, fires, and flooded areas. We also implement ablation studies of anomalous class imbalance and the data scale competing against the normal class. Our experiments provide results of high accuracies over 95% for F1. Furthermore, we found that the deeper FCDD with a VGG16 backbone consistently outperformed other baselines CNN27, ResNet101, and Inceptionv3. This study presents a new solution that offers a disaster anomaly detection application for initial responses with higher accuracy and devastation explainability, providing a novel contribution to the prompt disaster recovery problem in the research area of anomaly scene understanding. Finally, we discuss future works to improve more robust, explainable applications for effective initial responses.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a deep learning-based anomaly detection system using deeper fully convolutional data descriptions (FCDDs) to improve the speed and accuracy of initial disaster response, achieving over 95% F1-score accuracy on a disaster image dataset.

    "title": "Collective Conditioned Reflex: A Bio-Inspired Fast Emergency Reaction Mechanism for Designing Safe Multi-Robot Systems",
    "published_date": "2022-02-24",
    "abstract": "A multi-robot system (MRS) is a group of coordinated robots designed to cooperate with each other and accomplish given tasks. Due to the uncertainties in operating environments, the system may encounter emergencies, such as unobserved obstacles, moving vehicles, and extreme weather. Animal groups such as bee colonies initiate collective emergency reaction behaviors such as bypassing obstacles and avoiding predators, similar to muscle conditioned reflex which organizes local muscles to avoid hazards in the first response without delaying passage through the brain. Inspired by this, we develop a similar collective conditioned reflex mechanism for multi-robot systems to respond to emergencies. In this study, Collective Conditioned Reflex (CCR), a bio-inspired emergency reaction mechanism, is developed based on animal collective behavior analysis and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The algorithm uses a physical model to determine if the robots are experiencing an emergency; then, rewards for robots involved in the emergency are augmented with corresponding heuristic rewards, which evaluate emergency magnitudes and consequences and decide local robots' participation. CCR is validated on three typical emergency scenarios: turbulence, strong wind, and hidden obstacle. Simulation results demonstrate that CCR improves robot teams' emergency reaction capability with faster reaction speed and safer trajectory adjustment compared with baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "Designing effective emergency response management (ERM) systems to respond to incidents such as road accidents is a major problem faced by communities. In addition to responding to frequent incidents each day (about 240 million emergency medical services calls and over 5 million road accidents in the US each year), these systems also support response during natural hazards. Recently, there has been a consistent interest in building decision support and optimization tools that can help emergency responders provide more efficient and effective response. This includes a number of principled subsystems that implement early incident detection, incident likelihood forecasting and strategic resource allocation and dispatch policies. In this paper, we highlight the key challenges and provide an overview of the approach developed by our team in collaboration with our community partners.",

    "title": "Learning to Help Emergency Vehicles Arrive Faster: A Cooperative Vehicle-Road Scheduling Approach",
    "published_date": "2022-02-20",
    "abstract": "The ever-increasing heavy traffic congestion potentially impedes the accessibility of emergency vehicles (EVs), resulting in detrimental impacts on critical services and even safety of people's lives. Hence, it is significant to propose an efficient scheduling approach to help EVs arrive faster. Existing vehicle-centric scheduling approaches aim to recommend the optimal paths for EVs based on the current traffic status while the road-centric scheduling approaches aim to improve the traffic condition and assign a higher priority for EVs to pass an intersection. With the intuition that real-time vehicle-road information interaction and strategy coordination can bring more benefits, we propose LEVID, a LEarning-based cooperative VehIcle-roaD scheduling approach including a real-time route planning module and a collaborative traffic signal control module, which interact with each other and make decisions iteratively. The real-time route planning module adapts the artificial potential field method to address the real-time changes of traffic signals and avoid falling into a local optimum. The collaborative traffic signal control module leverages a graph attention reinforcement learning framework to extract the latent features of different intersections and abstract their interplay to learn cooperative policies. Extensive experiments based on multiple real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "title": "Explainable and Safe Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Air Mobility",
    "published_date": "2022-11-24",
    "abstract": "Increasing traffic demands, higher levels of automation, and communication enhancements provide novel design opportunities for future air traffic controllers (ATCs). This article presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) controller to aid conflict resolution for autonomous free flight. Although DRL has achieved important advancements in this field, the existing works pay little attention to the explainability and safety issues related to DRL controllers, particularly the safety under adversarial attacks. To address those two issues, we design a fully explainable DRL framework wherein we: 1) decompose the coupled Q value learning model into a safety-awareness and efficiency (reach the target) one; and 2) use information from surrounding intruders as inputs, eliminating the needs of central controllers. In our simulated experiments, we show that by decoupling the safety-awareness and efficiency, we can exceed performance on free flight control tasks while dramatically improving explainability on practical. In addition, the safety Q learning module provides rich information about the safety situation of environments. To study the safety under adversarial attacks, we additionally propose an adversarial attack strategy that can impose both safety-oriented and efficiency-oriented attacks. The adversarial aims to minimize safety/efficiency by only attacking the agent at a few time steps. In the experiments, our attack strategy increases as many collisions as the uniform attack (i.e., attacking at every time step) by only attacking the agent four times less often, which provide insights into the capabilities and restrictions of the DRL in future ATC designs. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/WLeiiiii/Gym-ATC-Attack-Project.",
