    "title": "Separation Assurance in Urban Air Mobility Systems using Shared Scheduling Protocols",
    "published_date": "2025-01-15",
    "abstract": "Ensuring safe separation between aircraft is a critical challenge in air traffic management, particularly in urban air mobility (UAM) environments where high traffic density and low altitudes require precise control. In these environments, conflicts often arise at the intersections of flight corridors, posing significant risks. We propose a tactical separation approach leveraging shared scheduling protocols, originally designed for Ethernet networks and operating systems, to coordinate access to these intersections. Using a decentralized Markov decision process framework, the proposed approach enables aircraft to autonomously adjust their speed and timing as they navigate these critical areas, maintaining safe separation without a central controller. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in simulated UAM scenarios, demonstrating its ability to reduce separation violations to zero while acknowledging trade-offs in flight times as traffic density increases. Additionally, we explore the impact of non-compliant aircraft, showing that while shared scheduling protocols can no longer guarantee safe separation, they still provide significant improvements over systems without scheduling protocols.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a decentralized, shared scheduling protocol for ensuring safe separation in high-density urban air mobility (UAM) environments, enabling autonomous aircraft to coordinate their movements at intersection points and significantly reducing separation violations, even with non-compliant aircraft. The approach uses a Markov decision process framework and demonstrates effectiveness in simulation, although increased traffic density results in longer flight times."

    "title": "Exploring the Impact of Rewards on Developers' Proactive AI Accountability Behavior",
    "published_date": "2024-11-27",
    "abstract": "The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems offers benefits for various domains of the economy and society but simultaneously raises concerns due to emerging scandals. These scandals have led to the increasing importance of AI accountability to ensure that actors provide justification and victims receive compensation. However, AI accountability has a negative connotation due to its emphasis on penalizing sanctions, resulting in reactive approaches to emerging concerns. To counteract the prevalent negative view and offer a proactive approach to facilitate the AI accountability behavior of developers, we explore rewards as an alternative mechanism to sanctions. We develop a theoretical model grounded in Self-Determination Theory to uncover the potential impact of rewards and sanctions on AI developers. We further identify typical sanctions and bug bounties as potential reward mechanisms by surveying related research from various domains, including cybersecurity.",
    "summary": "This paper investigates the impact of rewards, specifically bug bounties, on encouraging proactive AI accountability behavior among developers, contrasting this approach with the typically negative and reactive approach of sanctions. A theoretical model based on Self-Determination Theory is used to explore the effectiveness of these reward mechanisms."

    "title": "An Exploratory Mixed-Methods Study on General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance in Open-Source Software",
    "published_date": "2024-06-20",
    "abstract": "Background: Governments worldwide are considering data privacy regulations. These laws, e.g. the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require software developers to meet privacy-related requirements when interacting with users' data. Prior research describes the impact of such laws on software development, but only for commercial software. Open-source software is commonly integrated into regulated software, and thus must be engineered or adapted for compliance. We do not know how such laws impact open-source software development. Aims: To understand how data privacy laws affect open-source software development. We studied the European Union's GDPR, the most prominent such law. We investigated how GDPR compliance activities influence OSS developer activity (RQ1), how OSS developers perceive fulfilling GDPR requirements (RQ2), the most challenging GDPR requirements to implement (RQ3), and how OSS developers assess GDPR compliance (RQ4). Method: We distributed an online survey to explore perceptions of GDPR implementations from open-source developers (N=56). We further conducted a repository mining study to analyze development metrics on pull requests (N=31462) submitted to open-source GitHub repositories. Results: GDPR policies complicate open-source development processes and introduce challenges for developers, primarily regarding the management of users' data, implementation costs and time, and assessments of compliance. Moreover, we observed negative perceptions of GDPR from open-source developers and significant increases in development activity, in particular metrics related to coding and reviewing activity, on GitHub pull requests related to GDPR compliance. Conclusions: Our findings motivate policy-related resources and automated tools to support data privacy regulation implementation and compliance efforts in open-source software.",

    "summary": "This mixed-methods study investigated the impact of the GDPR on open-source software development, finding that while GDPR compliance increased development activity, it also introduced challenges related to data management, cost, time, and compliance assessment, leading to generally negative developer perceptions. The researchers recommend policy support and automated tools to aid future GDPR compliance efforts in open-source projects."

    "published_date": "2024-10-08",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to managing access to Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), focusing on combating the misuse of tokens through performance analysis and statistical access patterns. In particular, we explore the impact of token sharing on the content delivery infrastructure, proposing the definition of acceptable request limits to detect and block abnormal accesses. Additionally, we introduce countermeasures against piracy, such as degrading the quality of service for pirate users to discourage them from illegal sharing, and using queuing models to quantify system performance in different piracy scenarios. Adopting these measures can improve the consistency and efficiency of CDN access and cost management, protecting the infrastructure and the legitimate user experience.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a minimally intrusive CDN access management system that leverages performance modeling and access pattern analysis to detect and mitigate token misuse and piracy, improving CDN efficiency and protecting legitimate users. The system uses request limits, QoS degradation for pirates, and queuing models to achieve this."

    "title": "IoT Monitoring with Blockchain: Generating Smart Contracts from Service Level Agreements",
    "published_date": "2024-08-23",
    "abstract": "A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a client and provider that assures the quality of service (QoS) a client can expect to receive when purchasing a service. However, evidence of SLA violations in Internet of Things (IoT) service monitoring data can be manipulated by the provider or consumer, resulting in an issue of trust between contracted parties. The following research aims to explore the use of blockchain technology in monitoring IoT systems using smart contracts so that SLA violations captured are irrefutable amongst service providers and clients. The research focuses on the development of a Java library that is capable of generating a smart contract from a given SLA. A smart contract generated by this library is validated through a mock scenario presented in the form of a Remote Patient Monitoring IoT system. In this scenario, the findings demonstrate a 100 percent success rate in capturing all emulated violations.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes using blockchain and smart contracts to ensure trustworthy monitoring of Internet of Things (IoT) services by automatically generating smart contracts from Service Level Agreements (SLAs), thus preventing manipulation of SLA violation evidence. A Java library for this process is developed and validated through a successful remote patient monitoring scenario."

    "title": "Blockchain based resource governance for decentralized web environments",
    "published_date": "2023-01-17",
    "abstract": "Decentralization initiatives such as Solid, Digi.me, and ActivityPub aim to give data owners more control over their data and to level the playing field by enabling small companies and individuals to gain access to data, thus stimulating innovation. However, these initiatives typically use access control mechanisms that cannot verify compliance with usage conditions after access has been granted to others. In this paper, we extend the state of the art by proposing a resource governance conceptual framework, entitled ReGov, that facilitates usage control in decentralized web environments. We subsequently demonstrate how our framework can be instantiated by combining blockchain and trusted execution environments. Through blockchain technologies, we record policies expressing the usage conditions associated with resources and monitor their compliance. Our instantiation employs trusted execution environments to enforce said policies, inside data consumers' devices. We evaluate the framework instantiation through a detailed analysis of requirments derived from a data market motivating scenario, as well as an assessment of the security, privacy, and affordability aspects of our proposal.",

    "summary": "The ReGov framework uses blockchain to record and monitor usage policies for decentralized web resources, enhancing data governance by leveraging trusted execution environments to enforce these policies on data consumers' devices. This approach addresses limitations in existing decentralized web access control mechanisms."

    "title": "A Regulatory System for Optimal Legal Transaction Throughput in Cryptocurrency Blockchains",
    "published_date": "2021-03-30",
    "abstract": "Permissionless blockchain consensus protocols have been designed primarily for defining decentralized economies for the commercial trade of assets, both virtual and physical, using cryptocurrencies. In most instances, the assets being traded are regulated, which mandates that the legal right to their trade and their trade value are determined by the governmental regulator of the jurisdiction in which the trade occurs. Unfortunately, existing blockchains do not formally recognise proposal of legal cryptocurrency transactions, as part of the execution of their respective consensus protocols, resulting in rampant illegal activities in the associated crypto-economies. In this contribution, we motivate the need for regulated blockchain consensus protocols with a case study of the illegal, cryptocurrency based, Silk Road darknet market. We present a novel regulatory framework for blockchain protocols, for ensuring legal transaction confirmation as part of the blockchain distributed consensus. As per our regulatory framework, we derive conditions under which legal transaction throughput supersedes throughput of traditional transactions, which are, in the worst case, an indifferentiable mix of legal and illegal transactions. Finally, we show that with a small change to the standard blockchain consensus execution policy (appropriately introduced through regulation), the legal transaction throughput in the blockchain network can be maximized.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a regulatory framework for blockchain consensus protocols to prioritize legal cryptocurrency transactions, addressing the issue of illegal activities within crypto-economies by maximizing legal transaction throughput through a modified consensus execution policy. The framework is motivated by the need to formally recognize legal transactions within blockchain systems."

    "title": "Privacy-Preserving Supervisory Control of Discrete-Event Systems via Co-Synthesis of Edit Function and Supervisor for Opacity Enforcement and Requirement Satisfaction",
    "published_date": "2021-04-09",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of co-synthesis of edit function and supervisor for opacity enforcement in the supervisory control of discrete-event systems (DES), assuming the presence of an external (passive) intruder, where the following goals need to be achieved: 1) the external intruder should never infer the system secret, i.e., the system is opaque, and never be sure about the existence of the edit function, i.e., the edit function remains covert; 2) the controlled plant behaviors should satisfy some safety and nonblockingness requirements, in the presence of the edit function. We focus on the class of edit functions that satisfy the following properties: 1) the observation capability of the edit function in general can be different from those of the supervisor and the intruder; 2) the edit function can implement insertion, deletion, and replacement operations; 3) the edit function performs bounded edit operations, i.e., the length of each string output of the edit function is upper bounded by a given constant. We propose an approach to solve this cosynthesis problem by modeling it as a distributed supervisor synthesis problem in the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control framework. By taking the special structure of this distributed supervisor synthesis problem into consideration and to improve the possibility of finding a non-empty distributed supervisor, we propose two novel synthesis heuristics that incrementally synthesize the supervisor and the edit function. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on an example in the enforcement of the location privacy.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel co-synthesis approach for designing a supervisor and an edit function to ensure opacity (hiding system secrets from intruders) in discrete-event systems while maintaining system requirements, using a distributed supervisory control framework and two new synthesis heuristics. The edit function, which can insert, delete, or replace events, is designed to remain covert while ensuring opacity and satisfying safety and nonblockingness constraints."
