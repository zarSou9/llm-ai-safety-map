### Mini Description

Detailed protocols for conducting audits, including methodologies for evidence collection, testing procedures, and analysis frameworks.

### Description

Assessment procedures for AI auditing define the systematic methodologies and workflows for evaluating AI systems against established criteria and requirements. These procedures must balance thoroughness with practicality while ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different audits. They encompass both automated testing approaches and manual inspection processes, requiring careful coordination between technical tools, human expertise, and organizational protocols.

A key challenge in developing effective assessment procedures is handling the complexity and opacity of modern AI systems. Traditional software testing approaches often fall short when dealing with neural networks and other machine learning models where behavior can be difficult to predict or verify. This has led to the development of specialized techniques for testing AI-specific properties such as robustness, fairness, and alignment with stated objectives. Current research focuses on methods for decomposing complex systems into testable components, establishing appropriate test coverage metrics, and developing procedures for evaluating emergent behaviors.

The field is actively exploring ways to standardize assessment procedures while maintaining flexibility to address diverse AI applications and contexts. This includes developing frameworks for risk-based testing prioritization, methods for continuous monitoring during deployment, and approaches for evaluating AI systems' interaction with broader sociotechnical systems. Particular attention is being paid to procedures for detecting potential failure modes, assessing system boundaries and limitations, and validating safety claims across different operational conditions.
