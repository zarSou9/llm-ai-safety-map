    "published_date": "2019-07-13",
    "summary": "The COMPAS algorithm controversy stems from conflicting definitions of fairness; Northpointe demonstrated calibration fairness (equal predictive accuracy across racial groups), while ProPublica highlighted the lack of parity fairness (equal false positive and false negative rates). These competing metrics are mathematically incompatible when base rates differ, rendering a perfectly \"fair\" algorithm impossible in practice."

    "title": "IN SEARCH OF A MEASURE OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTIONS: AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Internal auditing (IA) effectiveness is still viewed, to large extent, as a “black box” in academic research. In this article, relevant empirical studies based on self-assessments of internal auditors and on other stakeholders' perspectives are reviewed through an “effectiveness lens.” Major patterns are identified in the existing literature. This article reviews the empirical literature on IA effectiveness that has been published since the latest revision of the IA definition in 1999, using the perspectives of new institutional theory and institutional entrepreneurship as a framework, thereby recognizing the tension between institutional forces and the role of agency. In cases where isomorphic forces are in conflict with other organizational demands, chief auditing executives' (CAE) agency can be a solution that enables local adaptation (institutional entrepreneurship). The ability to exploit fully the potential of agency is an opportunity for the CAE to tailor and advance the role of IA in its specific organizational context.",

    "summary": "This paper reviews empirical research on internal audit effectiveness since 1999, using the lens of new institutional theory to identify recurring patterns and highlight the chief audit executive's role in navigating conflicting institutional pressures to achieve local adaptation. The authors emphasize the CAE's agency in tailoring internal audit functions to specific organizational contexts."

    "title": "Assessments in global software development: a tailorable framework for industrial projects",
    "abstract": "Assessments are an effective technique for software quality assurance. As global software development (GSD) becomes the standard, an assessment framework must be flexible to support different sourcing and shoring models. Although much work exists on inspections and reviews, an assessment framework which addresses these challenges is missing. We present a systematic yet flexible assessment framework. The paper contributes: i) The description of our assessment framework which addresses four challenges: Appropriateness of a software requirements specification (SRS), viability of software architectures and SRS, wholeness of work packages, and compliance of results with predefined quality objectives. ii) A detailed explanation how the assessment framework can be tailored to support offshore and outsourcing scenarios. This paper describes the result of a two years research initiative at Capgemini SD&M and serves the practitioner to implement assessment frameworks according to his needs. We also discuss open research questions of high relevance for the software industry.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a tailorable assessment framework for ensuring software quality in global software development projects, addressing challenges related to requirements specifications, architecture viability, work package completeness, and quality objective compliance across different sourcing models. The framework, developed through two years of research, is designed for practical implementation and highlights open research questions for the industry."
