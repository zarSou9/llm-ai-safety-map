### Mini Description

Design of systematic approaches for reviewing AI systems and their development processes, including standardized audit procedures, documentation requirements, and evaluation criteria.

### Description

AI auditing frameworks establish systematic methodologies and standards for evaluating AI systems' compliance with safety requirements, ethical guidelines, and regulatory obligations. These frameworks define the scope, procedures, and criteria for conducting thorough assessments of AI systems throughout their lifecycle, from development to deployment and ongoing operation. They aim to create reproducible, objective ways to verify that AI systems meet established standards while identifying potential risks or compliance gaps.

A key challenge in developing effective auditing frameworks is balancing comprehensiveness with practicality. Frameworks must be detailed enough to capture complex technical and ethical considerations while remaining implementable within reasonable resource constraints. This includes determining appropriate documentation requirements, establishing measurable evaluation criteria, and defining clear procedures for evidence collection and analysis. Current research focuses on developing standardized metrics, assessment tools, and documentation templates that can be adapted across different types of AI systems and use cases.

Emerging areas of investigation include methods for evaluating AI systems' robustness against manipulation, assessing the completeness and quality of training data documentation, and verifying claims about system capabilities and limitations. Particular attention is being paid to developing frameworks that can effectively audit black-box systems and complex neural networks where traditional software auditing approaches may fall short. There is also growing focus on frameworks for evaluating AI development processes themselves, including assessment of safety practices, testing procedures, and risk management protocols.
