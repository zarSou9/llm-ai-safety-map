### Mini Description

Specification of required documentation for AI systems, including model cards, datasheets, testing results, and development process records that enable thorough auditing.

### Description

Documentation standards for AI systems establish comprehensive requirements for recording and communicating essential information about an AI system's development, capabilities, limitations, and operational characteristics. These standards aim to enable effective auditing, promote transparency, and facilitate responsible development by ensuring critical details about AI systems are systematically captured and accessible to relevant stakeholders.

A key challenge in developing documentation standards is determining the appropriate level of detail and structure that balances completeness with practicality. Standards must capture complex technical information about model architectures, training processes, and performance characteristics while remaining accessible to various stakeholders, from technical auditors to policy makers. This includes establishing clear requirements for documenting training data sources, preprocessing steps, validation procedures, and known limitations or potential risks.

Current research focuses on developing standardized formats and templates that can accommodate diverse AI systems while ensuring consistency and comparability. This includes work on machine-readable documentation formats, versioning systems for evolving AI models, and methods for documenting complex system behaviors and failure modes. Particular attention is being paid to documentation requirements for safety-critical systems and the development of standards that can scale with increasing system complexity.
