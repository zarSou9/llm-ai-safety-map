    "title": "A Case Study of API Design for Interoperability and Security of the Internet of Things",
    "published_date": "2024-11-20",
    "abstract": "Heterogeneous distributed systems, including the Internet of Things (IoT) or distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS), often suffer a lack of interoperability and security, which hinders the wider deployment of such systems. Specifically, the different levels of security requirements and the heterogeneity in terms of communication models, for instance, point-to-point vs. publish-subscribe, are the example challenges of IoT and distributed CPS consisting of heterogeneous devices and applications. In this paper, we propose a working application programming interface (API) and runtime to enhance interoperability and security while addressing the challenges that stem from the heterogeneity in the IoT and distributed CPS. In our case study, we design and implement our application programming interface (API) design approach using open-source software, and with our working implementation, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our experimental results suggest that our approach can achieve both interoperability and security in the IoT and distributed CPS with a reasonably small overhead and better-managed software.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a case study of an API design for Internet of Things (IoT) systems, aiming to improve interoperability and security among heterogeneous devices and applications through open-source implementation and evaluation. The results demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in achieving both goals with minimal performance overhead."

    "title": "Secure Computation and Trustless Data Intermediaries in Data Spaces",
    "published_date": "2024-10-21",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the integration of advanced cryptographic techniques for secure computation in data spaces to enable secure and trusted data sharing, which is essential for the evolving data economy. In addition, the paper examines the role of data intermediaries, as outlined in the EU Data Governance Act, in data spaces and specifically introduces the idea of trustless intermediaries that do not have access to their users' data. Therefore, we exploit the introduced secure computation methods, i.e. Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and discuss the security benefits. Overall, we identify and address key challenges for integration, focusing on areas such as identity management, policy enforcement, node selection, and access control, and present solutions through real-world use cases, including air traffic management, manufacturing, and secondary data use. Furthermore, through the analysis of practical applications, this work proposes a comprehensive framework for the implementation and standardization of secure computing technologies in dynamic, trustless data environments, paving the way for future research and development of a secure and interoperable data ecosystem.",

    "title": "Blockchain Interoperability Landscape",
    "published_date": "2022-12-17",
    "abstract": "Blockchain has become a popular emergent technology in many industries. It is suitable for a broad range of applications, from its base role as an immutable distributed ledger to the deployment of distributed applications. Many organizations are adopting the technology, but choosing a specific blockchain implementation in an emerging field exposes them to significant technology risk. Selecting the wrong implementation could expose an organization to security vulnerabilities, reduce access to its target audience, or cause issues in the future when switching to a more mature protocol. Blockchain interoperability aims to solve this adaptability problem by increasing the extensibility of blockchain, enabling the addition of new use cases and features without sacrificing the performance of the original blockchain. However, most existing blockchain platforms need to be designed for interoperability, and simple operations like sending assets across platforms create problems. Cryptographic protocols that are secure in isolation may become insecure when several different (individually secure) protocols are composed. Similarly, utilizing trusted custodians may undercut most of the benefits of decentralization offered by blockchain-based systems. Even though there is some research and development in the field of blockchain interoperability, a characterization of the interoperability solutions for various infrastructure options is lacking. This paper presents a methodology for characterizing blockchain interoperability solutions that will help focus on new developments and evaluate existing and future solutions in this space.",

    "title": "PRShare: A Framework for Privacy-preserving, Interorganizational Data Sharing",
    "abstract": "We consider the task of interorganizational data sharing, in which data owners, data clients, and data subjects have different and sometimes competing privacy concerns. One real-world scenario in which this problem arises concerns law-enforcement use of phone-call metadata: The data owner is a phone company, the data clients are law-enforcement agencies, and the data subjects are individuals who make phone calls. A key challenge in this type of scenario is that each organization uses its own set of proprietary intraorganizational attributes to describe the shared data; such attributes cannot be shared with other organizations. Moreover, data-access policies are determined by multiple parties and may be specified using attributes that are not directly comparable with the ones used by the owner to specify the data. We propose a system architecture and a suite of protocols that facilitate dynamic and efficient interorganizational data sharing, while allowing each party to use its own set of proprietary attributes to describe the shared data and preserving the confidentiality of both data records and proprietary intraorganizational attributes. We introduce the novel technique of Attribute-Based Encryption with Oblivious Attribute Translation (OTABE), which plays a crucial role in our solution. This extension of attribute-based encryption uses semi-trusted proxies to enable dynamic and oblivious translation between proprietary attributes that belong to different organizations; it supports hidden access policies, direct revocation, and fine-grained, data-centric keys and queries. We prove that our OTABE-based framework is secure in the standard model and provide two real-world use cases.",

    "title": "Mahiru: a federated, policy-driven data processing and exchange system",
    "published_date": "2022-10-31",
    "abstract": "Secure, privacy-preserving sharing of scientiﬁc or business data is currently a popular topic for research and development, both in academia and outside of it. Systems have been proposed for sharing individual facts about individuals and sharing entire data sets, for sharing data through trusted third parties, for obfuscating sensitive data by anonymisation and homomorphic encryption, for distributed processing as in federated machine learning and secure multiparty computation, and for trading data access or ownership. However, these systems typically support only one of these solutions, while organisations often have a variety of data and use cases for which di ﬀ erent solutions are appropriate. If a single system could be built that is ﬂexible enough to support a variety of solutions, then administration would be greatly simpliﬁed and attack surfaces reduced. In this paper we present Mahiru, a design for a data exchange and processing system in which owners of data and software fully control their assets, users may submit a wide variety of processing requests including most of the above applications, and all parties collaborate to execute those requests in a distributed fashion, while ensuring that the policies are adhered to at all times. This is achieved through a federated, mostly decentralised architecture and a powerful policy mechanism designed to be easy to understand and simple to implement. We have created a proof-of-concept implementation of the system which is openly available and in continuous development, and which we aim to continue to extend with new functionality.",
    "summary": "Mahiru is a federated data processing and exchange system designed to allow flexible, policy-driven sharing and processing of data using various privacy-preserving techniques, all while maintaining user control over their assets. This is achieved through a decentralized architecture and a robust, user-friendly policy mechanism."
