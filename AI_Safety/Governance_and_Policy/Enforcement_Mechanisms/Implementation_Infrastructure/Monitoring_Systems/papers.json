    "title": "Real-World Community-in-the-Loop Smart Video Surveillance - A Case Study at a Community College",
    "published_date": "2023-03-22",
    "abstract": "Smart Video surveillance systems have become important recently for ensuring public safety and security, especially in smart cities. However, applying real-time artificial intelligence technologies combined with low-latency notification and alarming has made deploying these systems quite challenging. This paper presents a case study for designing and deploying smart video surveillance systems based on a real-world testbed at a community college. We primarily focus on a smart camera-based system that can identify suspicious/abnormal activities and alert the stakeholders and residents immediately. The paper highlights and addresses different algorithmic and system design challenges to guarantee real-time high-accuracy video analytics processing in the testbed. It also presents an example of cloud system infrastructure and a mobile application for real-time notification to keep students, faculty/staff, and responsible security personnel in the loop. At the same time, it covers the design decision to maintain communities' privacy and ethical requirements as well as hardware configuration and setups. We evaluate the system's performance using throughput and end-to-end latency. The experiment results show that, on average, our system's end-to-end latency to notify the end users in case of detecting suspicious objects is 5.3, 5.78, and 11.11 seconds when running 1, 4, and 8 cameras, respectively. On the other hand, in case of detecting anomalous behaviors, the system could notify the end users with 7.3, 7.63, and 20.78 seconds average latency. These results demonstrate that the system effectively detects and notifies abnormal behaviors and suspicious objects to the end users within a reasonable period. The system can run eight cameras simultaneously at a 32.41 Frame Per Second (FPS) rate.",

    "title": "Research on Early Warning and NB-IoT Real-time Monitoring System for Radiation Source Shedding of Gamma Flaw Detection Machine",
    "published_date": "2022-12-05",
    "abstract": ": The system takes the embedded system single chip as the core, and organizes the gamma ray induction module, keying switch, radiation source braid locking mechanism, on-site alarm equipment, NB-IoT communication module, GPS positioning system and other related equipment to realize real-time operators warning and remote alarming to the monitoring platform. Thus, timely management of the fallen radiation source can be realized. What's more, position of radiation source braid is monitored by radiation source braid locking mechanism, gamma-ray induction module and keying switch. This idea solves the bottleneck problem of difficulty in transmitting real-time remote monitoring signal by NB-IoT technology. Single-chip microcontroller is innovatively embedded around the radiation source to monitor whether the source falls off. As a result, when part or all of the source braid are not returned to the storage location of the flaw detector, the gamma ray induction module, keying switch, and radiation source braid locking mechanism remind the operator of the dangerous situation. At the same time, NB-IoT transmission system alarms companies and regulators of safety risks. In conclusion, radiation source can be found timely when it falls off, to avoid radiation accident. Two bottlenecks related to installing GPS positioning system can be solved, that the GPS positioning system is installed on the flaw detector, and the radioactive source is still unable to be controlled, and that the GPS positioning system requires power to transmit the signal back to the regulatory platform or to the platform of the flaw detection enterprise. This article's ideas can solve this problem through the advantages of NB-IoT.",
    "summary": "This paper presents an NB-IoT-based real-time monitoring system for gamma flaw detection machines, using embedded sensors and a locking mechanism to detect and remotely report radiation source shedding, thus preventing radiation accidents. The system overcomes limitations of previous GPS-based solutions by leveraging NB-IoT's low-power, wide-area capabilities."

    "title": "Application Scheduling With Multiplexed Sensing of Monitoring Points in Multi-Purpose IoT Wireless Sensor Networks",
    "published_date": "2022-10-12",
    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a crucial role in Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems serving a variety of applications. They gather data from specific sensor nodes and transmit it to remote units for processing. When multiple applications share a WSN infrastructure, efficient scheduling becomes vital. In our research, we address the problem of application scheduling in WSNs. Specifically, we focus on scenarios where applications request data from monitoring points within the coverage area of a WSN. We propose a shared-data approach that reduces the network's sensing and communication load by allowing multiple applications to use the same sensing data. To tackle the scheduling challenge, we introduce a genetic algorithm named GABAS and three greedy algorithms: LMPF, LMSF, and LTSF. These algorithms determine the order in which applications are admitted to the WSN infrastructure, considering various criteria. To assess the performance of our algorithms, we conducted extensive simulation experiments and compared them with standard scheduling methods. We also evaluated the performance of GABAS as compared to another genetic scheduling algorithm that has recently appeared in the literature. The overall experimental results show that the methods we propose outperform the compared approaches across various metrics, namely makespan, turnaround time, waiting time, and successful execution rate. In particular, our genetic algorithm proves to be highly effective in scheduling applications and optimizing the mentioned metrics.",

    "title": "Model-bounded Monitoring of Hybrid Systems",
    "published_date": "2021-02-15",
    "abstract": "Monitoring of hybrid systems attracts both scientific and practical attention. However, monitoring algorithms suffer from the methodological difficulty of only observing sampled discrete-time signals, while real behaviors are continuous-time signals. To mitigate this problem of sampling uncertainties, we introduce a model-bounded monitoring scheme, where we use prior knowledge about the target system to prune interpolation candidates. Technically, we express such prior knowledge by linear hybrid automata (LHAs)—the LHAs are called bounding models. We introduce a novel notion of monitored language of LHAs, and we reduce the monitoring problem to the membership problem of the monitored language. We present two partial algorithms—one is via reduction to reachability in LHAs and the other is a direct one using polyhedra—and show that these methods, and thus the proposed model-bounded monitoring scheme, are efficient and practically relevant.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a model-bounded monitoring scheme for hybrid systems that addresses the challenges of monitoring continuous-time systems with discrete-time observations by leveraging linear hybrid automata as bounding models to constrain interpolation and reduce the monitoring problem to language membership. Two efficient partial algorithms for this scheme are introduced and analyzed."

    "abstract": "Cross-border security is of topmost priority for societies. Economies lose billions each year due to counterfeiters and other threats. Security checkpoints equipped with X-ray Security Systems (NIIS-Non-Intrusive Inspection Systems) like airports, ports, border control and customs authorities tackle the myriad of threats by using NIIS to inspect bags, air, land, sea and rail cargo, and vehicles. The reliance on the X-ray scanning systems necessitates their continuous 24/7 functioning being provided for. Hence the need for their working condition being closely monitored and preemptive actions being taken to reduce the overall X-ray systems downtime. In this paper, we present a predictive maintenance decision support system, abbreviated as PMT4NIIS (Predictive Maintenance Tool for Non-Intrusive Inspection Systems), which is a kind of augmented analytics platforms that provides real-time AI-generated warnings for upcoming risk of system malfunctioning leading to possible downtime. The industrial platform is the basis of a 24/7 Service Desk and Monitoring center for the working condition of various X-ray Security Systems.",

    "title": "A Novel Spatial–Temporal Specification-Based Monitoring System for Smart Cities",
    "published_date": "2021-04-11",
    "abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Things, millions of sensors are being deployed in cities to collect real-time data. This leads to a need for checking city states against city requirements at runtime. In this article, we develop a novel spatial–temporal specification-based monitoring system for smart cities. We first describe a study of over 1000 smart city requirements, some of which cannot be specified using the existing logic, such as the signal temporal logic (STL) and its variants. To tackle this limitation, we develop spatial aggregation STL (SaSTL)—a novel spatial aggregation STL—for the efficient runtime monitoring of safety and performance requirements in smart cities. We develop two new logical operators in SaSTL to augment STL for expressing spatial aggregation and spatial counting characteristics that are commonly found in real city requirements. We define the Boolean and quantitative semantics for SaSTL in support of the analysis of city performance across different periods and locations. We also develop efficient monitoring algorithms that can check the SaSTL requirement in parallel over multiple data streams (e.g., generated by multiple sensors distributed spatially in a city). Additionally, we build an SaSTL-based monitoring tool to support decision making of different stakeholders to specify and runtime monitor their requirements in smart cities. We evaluate our SaSTL monitor by applying it to three case studies with large-scale real city sensing data (e.g., up to 10 000 sensors in one study). The results show that SaSTL has a much higher coverage expressiveness than other spatial–temporal logics, and with a significant reduction of computation time for monitoring requirements. We also demonstrate that the SaSTL monitor improves the safety and performance of smart cities via simulated experiments.",
