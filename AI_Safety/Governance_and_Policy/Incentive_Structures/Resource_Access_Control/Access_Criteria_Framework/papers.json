    "title": "RAGent: Retrieval-based Access Control Policy Generation",
    "published_date": "2024-09-08",
    "abstract": "Manually generating access control policies from an organization's high-level requirement specifications poses significant challenges. It requires laborious efforts to sift through multiple documents containing such specifications and translate their access requirements into access control policies. Also, the complexities and ambiguities of these specifications often result in errors by system administrators during the translation process, leading to data breaches. However, the automated policy generation frameworks designed to help administrators in this process are unreliable due to limitations, such as the lack of domain adaptation. Therefore, to improve the reliability of access control policy generation, we propose RAGent, a novel retrieval-based access control policy generation framework based on language models. RAGent identifies access requirements from high-level requirement specifications with an average state-of-the-art F1 score of 87.9%. Through retrieval augmented generation, RAGent then translates the identified access requirements into access control policies with an F1 score of 77.9%. Unlike existing frameworks, RAGent generates policies with complex components like purposes and conditions, in addition to subjects, actions, and resources. Moreover, RAGent automatically verifies the generated policies and iteratively refines them through a novel verification-refinement mechanism, further improving the reliability of the process by 3%, reaching the F1 score of 80.6%. We also introduce three annotated datasets for developing access control policy generation frameworks in the future, addressing the data scarcity of the domain.",

    "summary": "RAGent is a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework that automates access control policy creation from high-level requirements, achieving high accuracy (F1 scores of 87.9% for requirement identification and 80.6% for policy generation) by incorporating a verification-refinement mechanism and generating policies with complex components. It addresses limitations of existing frameworks by improving reliability and providing three new annotated datasets for future research."

    "title": "Collaborative Access Control for IoT - A Blockchain Approach",
    "published_date": "2024-05-24",
    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates robust access control mechanisms to secure a vast array of interconnected devices. We adopt the blockchain based decentralized access control approach and identify the gaps in existing works. Then, We develop a blockchain embedded access control (BEAC) framework to bridge the gaps. First, blockchain based solutions for access control require an enabling P2P network while existing P2P overlays do not support some required features. We develop a novel P2P infrastructure to seamlessly support our BEAC framework. Second, most of the works consider blockchain based access control for a single access control model, and we develop a generic blockchain mechanism and show that it can support the embedding of various access control models. Finally, existing works adopt existing blockchain platforms which may incur a high communication overhead. We design a more efficient consortium blockchain solution by leveraging more advanced components to achieve better performance. Our experiments demonstrate that our design can cut the communication cost to half compared to the most recent Hyperledger Fabric platform.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a novel blockchain-based access control framework (BEAC) for IoT devices, addressing limitations of existing systems by developing a new P2P infrastructure and a generic mechanism supporting multiple access control models, ultimately achieving improved performance and reduced communication costs compared to Hyperledger Fabric."

    "title": "FRAP: A Flexible Resource Accessing Protocol for Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems",
    "published_date": "2024-08-25",
    "abstract": "Fully-partitioned fixed-priority scheduling (FP-FPS) multiprocessor systems are widely found in real-time applications, where spin-based protocols are often deployed to manage the mutually exclusive access of shared resources. Unfortunately, existing approaches either enforce rigid spin priority rules for resource accessing or carry significant pessimism in the schedulability analysis, imposing substantial blocking time regardless of task execution urgency or resource over-provisioning. This paper proposes FRAP, a spin-based flexible resource accessing protocol for FP-FPS systems. A task under FRAP can spin at any priority within a range for accessing a resource, allowing flexible and finegrained resource control with predictable worst-case behaviour. Under flexible spinning, we demonstrate that the existing analysis techniques can lead to incorrect timing bounds and present a novel MCMF (minimum cost maximum flow)-based blocking analysis, providing predictability guarantee for FRAP. A spin priority assignment is reported that fully exploits flexible spinning to reduce the blocking time of tasks with high urgency, enhancing the performance of FRAP. Experimental results show that FRAP outperforms the existing spin-based protocols in schedulability by $\\mathbf{1 5. 2 0 \\%} \\mathbf{- 3 2. 7 3 \\%}$ on average, up to $\\mathbf{6 5. 8 5 \\%}$.",
    "summary": "FRAP is a novel spin-based resource access protocol for real-time multiprocessor systems that allows flexible task spin priorities, improving schedulability compared to existing methods. This flexibility is supported by a novel minimum cost maximum flow-based blocking analysis guaranteeing predictable worst-case behavior and significantly reducing blocking time for urgent tasks."

    "title": "Algorithms for Multi-Criteria Decision-Making and Efficiency Analysis Problems",
    "published_date": "2024-06-10",
    "abstract": "Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems involve the evaluation of alternatives based on various minimization and maximization criteria. Similarly, efficiency evaluation (EA) methods assess decision-making units (DMUs) by analyzing their input consumption and output production. MCDM and EA methods face challenges in managing alternatives and DMUs with varying capacities across different criteria (inputs and outputs). That leads to performance assessments often skewed by subjective biases in criteria weighting. We introduce two innovative scenarios utilizing linear programming-based Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models to address these limitations. This dual-scenario approach aims to mitigate traditional biases, offering robust solutions for comprehensively assessing alternatives and DMUs. Our methodology allows for the influential ranking of alternatives in MCDM problems and enables each DMU to adjust its input and output ratios to achieve efficiency.",

    "published_date": "2022-04-06",
    "abstract": "Essential functionality in the ICT (Information and Communication Technology) space draws from standards such as HTTP (IETF RFC 2616, Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15) and various telecommunication standards (4G, 5G). They have fuelled rapid growth of ICT sector in the last decades by ensuring interoperability and consistency in computing environment. Research shows that firms that backed ICT standards and participated in standards development, have emerged as industry innovators. Standards development thus clearly has benefits for participating companies as well as technology development and innovation in general. However, significant costs are also associated with development of standards and need to be better understood to support investment in standardization necessary for todays ICT environment. We present a conceptual model that considers the potential for market innovation across a standards lifecycle and efficiency from standardization work, to build a forward-looking decision model that can guide an organizations standards development activities. We investigate and formalize motivations that drive firms to participate in standardization, specifically, changes in market innovation. Our model can serve as a strategic decision framework to drive assessments of a firms participation in standards development. We test our model with a use case on an established access control approach that was standardized more than two decades ago, Role Based Access Control (RBAC) using historical data. The investigation of the case study shows that change in market innovation is a significant indicator of success in standards development and are viable criteria to model a firms decision to participate (or not to participate) in a specific area of standardization.",
    "summary": "This paper develops a model to guide firms' strategic decisions regarding participation in standards development, considering the costs and benefits related to market innovation throughout a standard's lifecycle. A case study on Role-Based Access Control demonstrates that changes in market innovation significantly influence the success of standards development and inform participation decisions."

    "published_date": "2022-06-07",
    "abstract": "Controlled sharing is fundamental to distributed systems. We consider a capability-based distributed authorization system where a client receives capabilities (access tokens) from an authorization server to access the resources of resource servers. Capability-based authorization systems have been widely used on the Web, in mobile applications and other distributed systems. A common requirement of such systems is that the user uses tokens of multiple servers in a particular order. A related requirement is the token may be used if certain environmental conditions hold. We introduce a secure capability-based system that supports \"permission sequence\" and \"context\". This allows a finite sequence of permissions to be enforced, each with their own specific context. We prove the safety property of this system for these conditions and integrate the system into OAuth 2.0 with proof-of-possession tokens. We evaluate our implementation and compare it with plain OAuth with respect to the average time for obtaining an authorization token and acquiring access to the resource.",

The system improves upon standard OAuth by adding support for ordered permissions and contextual conditions."
