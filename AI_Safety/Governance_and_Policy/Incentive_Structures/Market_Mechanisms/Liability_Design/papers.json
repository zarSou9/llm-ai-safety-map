    "title": "Governing AI Agents",
    "published_date": "2025-01-14",
    "abstract": "The field of AI is undergoing a fundamental transition from systems that can produce synthetic content upon request to autonomous agents that can plan and execute complex tasks with only limited human involvement. Companies that pioneered the development of generative AI tools are now building AI agents that can be instructed to independently navigate the internet, perform a wide range of online tasks, and serve as artificial personal assistants and virtual coworkers. The opportunities presented by this new technology are tremendous, as are the associated risks. Fortunately, there exist robust analytic frameworks for confronting many of these challenges, namely, the economic theory of principal-agent problems and the common law doctrine of agency relationships. Drawing on these frameworks, this Article makes three contributions. First, it uses agency law and theory to identify and characterize problems arising from AI agents, including issues of information asymmetry, discretionary authority, and loyalty. Second, it illustrates the limitations of conventional solutions to agency problems: incentive design, monitoring, and enforcement might not be effective for governing AI agents that make uninterpretable decisions and operate at unprecedented speed and scale. Third, the Article explores the implications of agency law and theory for designing and regulating AI agents, arguing that new technical and legal infrastructure is needed to support governance principles of inclusivity, visibility, and liability.",
    "summary": "This paper argues that the rise of autonomous AI agents necessitates new legal and technical frameworks, as traditional agency law and incentive design are insufficient to address the unique challenges posed by their speed, scale, and opacity. It proposes focusing on governance principles of inclusivity, visibility, and liability to mitigate risks associated with these powerful new tools."

    "title": "Delegating Responsibilities to Intelligent Autonomous Systems: Challenges and Benefits",
    "published_date": "2024-11-06",
    "abstract": "As AI systems increasingly operate with autonomy and adaptability, the traditional boundaries of moral responsibility in techno-social systems are being challenged. This paper explores the evolving discourse on the delegation of responsibilities to intelligent autonomous agents and the ethical implications of such practices. Synthesizing recent developments in AI ethics, including concepts of distributed responsibility and ethical AI by design, the paper proposes a functionalist perspective as a framework. This perspective views moral responsibility not as an individual trait but as a role within a socio-technical system, distributed among human and artificial agents. As an example of 'AI ethical by design,' we present Basti and Vitiello's implementation. They suggest that AI can act as artificial moral agents by learning ethical guidelines and using Deontic Higher-Order Logic to assess decisions ethically. Motivated by the possible speed and scale beyond human supervision and ethical implications, the paper argues for 'AI ethical by design', while acknowledging the distributed, shared, and dynamic nature of responsibility. This functionalist approach offers a practical framework for navigating the complexities of AI ethics in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.",
    "summary": "This paper examines the ethical implications of delegating responsibilities to increasingly autonomous AI systems, arguing for a functionalist approach that distributes moral responsibility among humans and AI agents within a socio-technical system, advocating for \"AI ethical by design.\""

    "title": "Liability and Insurance for Catastrophic Losses: the Nuclear Power Precedent and Lessons for AI",
    "published_date": "2024-09-10",
    "abstract": "As AI systems become more autonomous and capable, experts warn of them potentially causing catastrophic losses. Drawing on the successful precedent set by the nuclear power industry, this paper argues that developers of frontier AI models should be assigned limited, strict, and exclusive third party liability for harms resulting from Critical AI Occurrences (CAIOs) - events that cause or easily could have caused catastrophic losses. Mandatory insurance for CAIO liability is recommended to overcome developers' judgment-proofness, mitigate winner's curse dynamics, and leverage insurers' quasi-regulatory abilities. Based on theoretical arguments and observations from the analogous nuclear power context, insurers are expected to engage in a mix of causal risk-modeling, monitoring, lobbying for stricter regulation, and providing loss prevention guidance in the context of insuring against heavy-tail risks from AI. While not a substitute for regulation, clear liability assignment and mandatory insurance can help efficiently allocate resources to risk-modeling and safe design, facilitating future regulatory efforts.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "To mitigate the catastrophic risks posed by advanced AI, the authors propose a liability regime mirroring the nuclear power industry: assigning developers limited, strict liability for critical AI occurrences, coupled with mandatory insurance to ensure compensation and incentivize safer AI development. This approach, while not replacing regulation, would efficiently allocate resources to risk management and inform future regulatory efforts."

    "title": "Decentralized Governance of Autonomous AI Agents",
    "published_date": "2024-12-22",
    "abstract": "Autonomous AI agents present transformative opportunities and significant governance challenges. Existing frameworks, such as the EU AI Act and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, fall short of addressing the complexities of these agents, which are capable of independent decision-making, learning, and adaptation. To bridge these gaps, we propose the ETHOS (Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System) framework, a decentralized governance (DeGov) model leveraging Web3 technologies, including blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). ETHOS establishes a global registry for AI agents, enabling dynamic risk classification, proportional oversight, and automated compliance monitoring through tools like soulbound tokens and zero-knowledge proofs. Furthermore, the framework incorporates decentralized justice systems for transparent dispute resolution and introduces AI specific legal entities to manage limited liability, supported by mandatory insurance to ensure financial accountability and incentivize ethical design. By integrating philosophical principles of rationality, ethical grounding, and goal alignment, ETHOS aims to create a robust research agenda for promoting trust, transparency, and participatory governance. This innovative framework offers a scalable and inclusive strategy for regulating AI agents, balancing innovation with ethical responsibility to meet the demands of an AI-driven future.",
    "summary": "The paper proposes ETHOS, a decentralized governance framework using Web3 technologies to regulate autonomous AI agents, addressing limitations of existing frameworks by enabling dynamic risk assessment, automated compliance, and decentralized dispute resolution. This approach aims to foster trust and ethical development in AI through a globally accessible and participatory system."

    "title": "The risks of risk-based AI regulation: taking liability seriously",
    "published_date": "2023-11-03",
    "abstract": "The development and regulation of multi-purpose, large\"foundation models\"of AI seems to have reached a critical stage, with major investments and new applications announced every other day. Some experts are calling for a moratorium on the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. Legislators globally compete to set the blueprint for a new regulatory regime. This paper analyses the most advanced legal proposal, the European Union's AI Act currently in the stage of final\"trilogue\"negotiations between the EU institutions. This legislation will likely have extra-territorial implications, sometimes called\"the Brussels effect\". It also constitutes a radical departure from conventional information and communications technology policy by regulating AI ex-ante through a risk-based approach that seeks to prevent certain harmful outcomes based on product safety principles. We offer a review and critique, specifically discussing the AI Act's problematic obligations regarding data quality and human oversight. Our proposal is to take liability seriously as the key regulatory mechanism. This signals to industry that if a breach of law occurs, firms are required to know in particular what their inputs were and how to retrain the system to remedy the breach. Moreover, we suggest differentiating between endogenous and exogenous sources of potential harm, which can be mitigated by carefully allocating liability between developers and deployers of AI technology.",
    "citation_count": 3,
    "summary": "The paper critiques the EU AI Act's risk-based approach to AI regulation, arguing that focusing on liability—specifically differentiating between endogenous and exogenous harm sources and assigning responsibility to developers and deployers—would be a more effective mechanism for ensuring AI safety and accountability. This approach would incentivize better data practices and system retraining."

    "title": "A Case for AI Safety via Law",
    "published_date": "2023-07-31",
    "abstract": "How to make artificial intelligence (AI) systems safe and aligned with human values is an open research question. Proposed solutions tend toward relying on human intervention in uncertain situations, learning human values and intentions through training or observation, providing off-switches, implementing isolation or simulation environments, or extrapolating what people would want if they had more knowledge and more time to think. Law-based approaches--such as inspired by Isaac Asimov--have not been well regarded. This paper makes a case that effective legal systems are the best way to address AI safety. Law is defined as any rules that codify prohibitions and prescriptions applicable to particular agents in specified domains/contexts and includes processes for enacting, managing, enforcing, and litigating such rules.",
    "summary": "This paper argues that legal frameworks, encompassing rules, enforcement, and litigation, offer the most effective approach to ensuring AI safety, surpassing other proposed technical solutions. It counters the common dismissal of law-based approaches to AI safety."

    "title": "International Governance of Civilian AI: A Jurisdictional Certification Approach",
    "published_date": "2023-08-29",
    "abstract": "This report describes trade-offs in the design of international governance arrangements for civilian artificial intelligence (AI) and presents one approach in detail. This approach represents the extension of a standards, licensing, and liability regime to the global level. We propose that states establish an International AI Organization (IAIO) to certify state jurisdictions (not firms or AI projects) for compliance with international oversight standards. States can give force to these international standards by adopting regulations prohibiting the import of goods whose supply chains embody AI from non-IAIO-certified jurisdictions. This borrows attributes from models of existing international organizations, such as the International Civilian Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). States can also adopt multilateral controls on the export of AI product inputs, such as specialized hardware, to non-certified jurisdictions. Indeed, both the import and export standards could be required for certification. As international actors reach consensus on risks of and minimum standards for advanced AI, a jurisdictional certification regime could mitigate a broad range of potential harms, including threats to public safety.",
    "citation_count": 19,
    "summary": "This report proposes an international AI governance system where an International AI Organization certifies state jurisdictions' compliance with AI safety standards, leveraging import/export controls to incentivize global adoption and mitigate risks. This jurisdictional certification approach draws parallels with existing international organizations regulating aviation, maritime shipping, and financial transactions."
