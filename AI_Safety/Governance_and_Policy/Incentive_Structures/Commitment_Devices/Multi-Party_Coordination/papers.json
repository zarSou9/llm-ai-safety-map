    "published_date": "2024-10-30",
    "abstract": "Multi-valued Byzantine agreement (MVBA) protocols are essential for atomic broadcast and fault-tolerant state machine replication in asynchronous networks. Despite advances, challenges persist in optimizing these protocols for communication and computation efficiency. This paper presents a committee-based MVBA protocol (cMVBA), a novel approach that achieves agreement without extra communication rounds by analyzing message patterns in asynchronous networks with probability 1.",

    "title": "Efficient Public Good Provision Between and Within Groups",
    "published_date": "2023-03-18",
    "abstract": "We generalize the model of Gallice and Monzon (2019) to incorporate a public goods game with groups, position uncertainty, and observational learning. Contributions are simultaneous within groups, but groups play sequentially based on their observation of an incomplete sample of past contributions. We show that full cooperation between and within groups is possible with self-interested players on a fixed horizon. Position uncertainty implies the existence of an equilibrium where groups of players conditionally cooperate in the hope of influencing further groups. Conditional cooperation implies that each group member is pivotal, so that efficient simultaneous provision within groups is an equilibrium.",
    "summary": "This paper extends a public goods game model to include inter-group and intra-group contributions, sequential play with observational learning, and position uncertainty. It demonstrates that full cooperation, both within and between groups, can be achieved even with self-interested players through conditional cooperation based on observed prior contributions."

    "title": "Discrete-choice Multi-agent Optimization: Decentralized Hard Constraint Satisfaction for Smart Cities",
    "published_date": "2023-05-26",
    "abstract": "Making Smart Cities more sustainable, resilient and democratic is emerging as an endeavor of satisfying hard constraints, for instance meeting net-zero targets. Decentralized multi-agent methods for socio-technical optimization of large-scale complex infrastructures such as energy and transport networks are scalable and more privacy-preserving by design. However, they mainly focus on satisfying soft constraints to remain cost-effective. This paper introduces a new model for decentralized hard constraint satisfaction in discrete-choice combinatorial optimization problems. The model solves the cold start problem of partial information for coordination during initialization that can violate hard constraints. It also preserves a low-cost satisfaction of hard constraints in subsequent coordinated choices during which soft constraints optimization is performed. Strikingly, experimental results in real-world Smart City application scenarios demonstrate the required behavioral shift to preserve optimality when hard constraints are satisfied. These findings are significant for policymakers, system operators, designers and architects to create the missing social capital of running cities in more viable trajectories.",

    "title": "Commitment Games with Conditional Information Disclosure",
    "published_date": "2022-04-07",
    "abstract": "The conditional commitment abilities of mutually transparent computer agents have been studied in previous work on commitment games and program equilibrium. This literature has shown how these abilities can help resolve Prisoner's Dilemmas and other failures of cooperation in complete information settings. But inefficiencies due to private information have been neglected thus far in this literature, despite the fact that these problems are pervasive and might also be addressed by greater mutual transparency. In this work, we introduce a framework for commitment games with a new kind of conditional commitment device, which agents can use to conditionally disclose private information. We prove a folk theorem for this setting that provides sufficient conditions for ex post efficiency, and thus represents a model of ideal cooperation between agents without a third-party mediator. Further, extending previous work on program equilibrium, we develop an implementation of conditional information disclosure. We show that this implementation forms program ε-Bayesian Nash equilibria corresponding to the Bayesian Nash equilibria of these commitment games.",

    "published_date": "2021-03-03",
    "abstract": "Large-scale multi-agent cooperative control problems have materially enjoyed the scalability, adaptivity, and flexibility of decentralized optimization. However, due to the mandatory iterative communications between the agents and the system operator, the decentralized architecture is vulnerable to malicious attacks and privacy breach. Current research on addressing privacy preservation of both agents and the system operator in cooperative decentralized optimization with strongly coupled objective functions and constraints is still primitive. To fill in the gaps, this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving decentralized optimization paradigm based on Paillier cryptosystem. The proposed paradigm achieves ideal correctness and security, as well as resists attacks from a range of adversaries. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach are verified via numerical simulations and a real-world physical platform.",

    "published_date": "2020-05-11",
    "abstract": "The problem of obtaining secret commitments from multiple parties and revealing them after a certain time is useful for sealed-bid auctions, games, and other applications. Existing solutions, dating back to Rivest, Shamir and Wagner, either do not scale or rely on synchrony for the commitment phase and trust of $t/n$ parties. We formalize the problem of implementing such commitments with a probabilistic delay and without the aforementioned assumptions as Multi-Party Timed Commitments (MPTC) and present a solution -- the Time-Capsule protocol. Like previous approaches, Time Capsule forms a puzzle whose solution reveals the committed values. But unlike previous solutions, no party has an advantage in solving the puzzle, and individual commitments cannot be revealed before the entire set is committed. A particular application of MPTC realizes an advancement in the study of decentralized systems. The state of the art in decentralized systems is manifested in blockchain systems that utilize Proof of Work to achieve censorship resistance. However, they are still vulnerable to frontrunning, an issue that is plaguing operational systems. By adapting Time Capsule, we allow it to be used for Proof of Work, preventing frontrunning by system operators and tuning the puzzle difficulty using the blockchain mechanism.",

    "summary": "The paper introduces Multi-Party Timed Commitments (MPTC) to solve the problem of securely committing secrets from multiple parties with delayed revelation, addressing scalability and trust limitations of existing methods. A novel protocol, Time-Capsule, is presented, offering a solution that prevents premature revelation and avoids giving any party an advantage in revealing the commitments, with application to improving decentralized systems and mitigating frontrunning in Proof-of-Work blockchains."
