    "title": "Realizing a Collaborative RDF Benchmark Suite in Practice",
    "published_date": "2024-10-16",
    "abstract": "Collaborative mechanisms allow benchmarks to be updated continuously and adjust to the changing requirements and new use cases. This paradigm is employed for example in the field of machine learning, but up until now there were no examples of truly open and collaborative benchmarks for RDF systems. In this demo paper we present the collaboration functionalities of RiverBench, an open, multi-task RDF benchmark suite. Owing to its fully open and community-driven design, RiverBench allows any researcher or practitioner to submit a new dataset or benchmark task, report performed benchmark runs, and edit any resource in the suite. RiverBench's collaboration system is itself based on RDF and Linked Data mechanisms, and every resource in the suite has machine-readable RDF metadata. The showcased functionalities together make up a first-of-a-kind fully open and collaborative RDF benchmark suite. These features are meant to encourage other researchers to contribute to RiverBench, and make it a long-term project sustained by the community.",
    "summary": "RiverBench is a novel, open-source RDF benchmark suite employing collaborative mechanisms allowing researchers to contribute datasets, tasks, and results, fostering continuous improvement and community-driven development. Its design leverages RDF and Linked Data for its own metadata and collaborative functionalities."

    "title": "A Framework for Incentivized Collaborative Learning",
    "published_date": "2023-05-26",
    "abstract": "Collaborations among various entities, such as companies, research labs, AI agents, and edge devices, have become increasingly crucial for achieving machine learning tasks that cannot be accomplished by a single entity alone. This is likely due to factors such as security constraints, privacy concerns, and limitations in computation resources. As a result, collaborative learning (CL) research has been gaining momentum. However, a significant challenge in practical applications of CL is how to effectively incentivize multiple entities to collaborate before any collaboration occurs. In this study, we propose ICL, a general framework for incentivized collaborative learning, and provide insights into the critical issue of when and why incentives can improve collaboration performance. Furthermore, we show the broad applicability of ICL to specific cases in federated learning, assisted learning, and multi-armed bandit with both theory and experimental results.",

    "title": "Strategic Data Sharing between Competitors",
    "published_date": "2023-05-25",
    "abstract": "Collaborative learning techniques have significantly advanced in recent years, enabling private model training across multiple organizations. Despite this opportunity, firms face a dilemma when considering data sharing with competitors -- while collaboration can improve a company's machine learning model, it may also benefit competitors and hence reduce profits. In this work, we introduce a general framework for analyzing this data-sharing trade-off. The framework consists of three components, representing the firms' production decisions, the effect of additional data on model quality, and the data-sharing negotiation process, respectively. We then study an instantiation of the framework, based on a conventional market model from economic theory, to identify key factors that affect collaboration incentives. Our findings indicate a profound impact of market conditions on the data-sharing incentives. In particular, we find that reduced competition, in terms of the similarities between the firms' products, and harder learning tasks foster collaboration.",

    "summary": "This paper models the strategic trade-off firms face when considering sharing data with competitors for improved machine learning, finding that collaboration is more likely under less competitive market conditions and when model training is more challenging."

    "title": "Incentivizing Honesty among Competitors in Collaborative Learning and Optimization",
    "published_date": "2023-05-25",
    "abstract": "Collaborative learning techniques have the potential to enable training machine learning models that are superior to models trained on a single entity's data. However, in many cases, potential participants in such collaborative schemes are competitors on a downstream task, such as firms that each aim to attract customers by providing the best recommendations. This can incentivize dishonest updates that damage other participants' models, potentially undermining the benefits of collaboration. In this work, we formulate a game that models such interactions and study two learning tasks within this framework: single-round mean estimation and multi-round SGD on strongly-convex objectives. For a natural class of player actions, we show that rational clients are incentivized to strongly manipulate their updates, preventing learning. We then propose mechanisms that incentivize honest communication and ensure learning quality comparable to full cooperation. Lastly, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our incentive scheme on a standard non-convex federated learning benchmark. Our work shows that explicitly modeling the incentives and actions of dishonest clients, rather than assuming them malicious, can enable strong robustness guarantees for collaborative learning.",

    "title": "Evaluating and Incentivizing Diverse Data Contributions in Collaborative Learning",
    "published_date": "2023-06-08",
    "abstract": "For a federated learning model to perform well, it is crucial to have a diverse and representative dataset. However, the data contributors may only be concerned with the performance on a specific subset of the population, which may not reflect the diversity of the wider population. This creates a tension between the principal (the FL platform designer) who cares about global performance and the agents (the data collectors) who care about local performance. In this work, we formulate this tension as a game between the principal and multiple agents, and focus on the linear experiment design problem to formally study their interaction. We show that the statistical criterion used to quantify the diversity of the data, as well as the choice of the federated learning algorithm used, has a significant effect on the resulting equilibrium. We leverage this to design simple optimal federated learning mechanisms that encourage data collectors to contribute data representative of the global population, thereby maximizing global performance.",

    "summary": "This paper models the problem of encouraging diverse data contributions in federated learning as a game between a platform and data contributors, showing that the choice of statistical diversity metric and federated learning algorithm significantly impacts the resulting equilibrium and proposing mechanisms to incentivize globally representative data."

    "title": "The Collaborative Business Intelligence Ontology (CBIOnt)",
    "published_date": "2022-11-02",
    "abstract": "In the current era, many disciplines are seen devoted towards ontology development for their domains with the intention of creating, disseminating and managing resource descriptions of their domain knowledge into machine understandable and processable manner. Ontology construction is a difficult group activity that involves many people with the different expertise. Generally, domain experts are not familiar with the ontology implementation environments and implementation experts do not have all the domain knowledge. We have designed Collaborative Business Intelligence Ontology (CBIOnt) for BI4People project. In this paper, we present CBIOnt that is OWL 2 DL ontology for the description of collaborative session between different collaborators working together on the business intelligent platform. As the collaborative session between various collaborators belongs to some collaborative form, phase and research aspect, therefore CBIOnt captures this knowledge along with the collaborative session content (comments, questions, answers, etc.) so that one can inference various types of information stored on ontologies when required. In addition, it stores the location and temporal-spatial information about the collaboration held between collaborators. We believe CBIOnt serves as a formal framework for dealing with the collaborative session taken place among collaborators on the semantic Web.",

It facilitates inference and knowledge management within a semantic web environment."

    "published_date": "2022-04-27",
    "abstract": "HCI researchers have been gradually shifting attention from individual users to communities when engaging in research, design, and system development. However, our field has yet to establish a cohesive, systematic understanding of the challenges, benefits, and commitments of community-collaborative approaches to research. We conducted a systematic review and thematic analysis of 47 computing research papers discussing participatory research with communities for the development of technological artifacts and systems, published over the last two decades. From this review, we identified seven themes associated with the evolution of a project: from establishing community partnerships to sustaining results. Our findings suggest that several tensions characterize these projects, many of which relate to the power and position of researchers, and the computing research environment, relative to community partners. We discuss the implications of our findings and offer methodological proposals to guide HCI, and computing research more broadly, towards practices that center communities.",

    "title": "Flexible Vertical Federated Learning With Heterogeneous Parties",
    "published_date": "2022-08-26",
    "abstract": "We propose flexible vertical federated learning (Flex-VFL), a distributed machine algorithm that trains a smooth, nonconvex function in a distributed system with vertically partitioned data. We consider a system with several parties that wish to collaboratively learn a global function. Each party holds a local dataset; the datasets have different features but share the same sample ID space. The parties are heterogeneous in nature: the parties' operating speeds, local model architectures, and optimizers may be different from one another and, further, they may change over time. To train a global model in such a system, Flex-VFL utilizes a form of parallel block coordinate descent (P-BCD), where parties train a partition of the global model via stochastic coordinate descent. We provide theoretical convergence analysis for Flex-VFL and show that the convergence rate is constrained by the party speeds and local optimizer parameters. We apply this analysis and extend our algorithm to adapt party learning rates in response to changing speeds and local optimizer parameters. Finally, we compare the convergence time of Flex-VFL against synchronous and asynchronous VFL algorithms, as well as illustrate the effectiveness of our adaptive extension.",
    "citation_count": 25,
    "summary": "Flex-VFL is a novel vertical federated learning algorithm that efficiently trains a global model from heterogeneous, vertically partitioned datasets by using parallel block coordinate descent, adapting to varying party speeds and optimizer parameters. Its convergence rate is theoretically analyzed and shown to be impacted by party-specific factors, leading to an adaptive extension for improved performance."
