### Mini Description

Analysis of economic and social incentives that influence AI development, and design of mechanisms to align developer and deployer interests with societal benefit.

### Description

Incentive structures in AI governance focus on understanding and designing mechanisms that shape the behavior of AI developers, deployers, and other stakeholders toward outcomes that benefit society. This includes both formal incentives, such as regulations, markets, and liability frameworks, and informal incentives like reputation, professional norms, and ethical guidelines. The field draws heavily from economics, game theory, and mechanism design to analyze how different actors respond to incentives and how these can be structured to promote safety and beneficial outcomes.

A central challenge is addressing misaligned incentives in AI development, where competitive pressures, market forces, or organizational objectives may encourage rushing deployment or cutting corners on safety. Researchers study how to create counterbalancing forces through mechanisms like certification schemes, insurance requirements, funding conditions, and reward structures that make safety and careful development economically advantageous. This includes examining how different incentive structures might affect the pace and direction of AI development, and how to prevent races to the bottom in safety standards.

Current research explores novel approaches such as commitment mechanisms, conditional compute access, and governance tokens that could help align institutional incentives with long-term societal interests. There is particular focus on designing robust incentive structures that remain effective as AI capabilities advance, including mechanisms that can adapt to changing circumstances and technological progress. Key open questions include how to create credible commitment mechanisms for powerful actors, how to design incentives that work across different jurisdictions and cultures, and how to balance competing interests while maintaining strong safety standards.
