### Mini Description

Programs and mechanisms to support development of AI safety expertise and governance capabilities across nations, particularly in regions with limited resources.

### Description

Capacity building in AI safety focuses on developing and strengthening the capabilities of nations, institutions, and communities to effectively participate in and contribute to global AI safety efforts. This includes establishing educational programs, technical infrastructure, and governance frameworks that enable meaningful engagement in international AI safety initiatives, particularly in regions with limited resources or expertise.

A key challenge is the significant disparity in AI capabilities and safety expertise across different nations and regions. This inequality can lead to exclusion from important decision-making processes and potentially create blind spots in global AI safety efforts. Current approaches focus on developing sustainable, locally-adapted programs that build both technical and governance capabilities while respecting cultural contexts and specific regional needs.

Research in this area examines effective methods for knowledge transfer, sustainable resource allocation, and the development of self-sustaining AI safety ecosystems in different contexts. This includes studying how to bridge gaps between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation, developing metrics for measuring capacity building success, and understanding how to maintain long-term engagement and expertise retention in resource-constrained environments.
