    "title": "Verification methods for international AI agreements",
    "published_date": "2024-08-28",
    "abstract": "What techniques can be used to verify compliance with international agreements about advanced AI development? In this paper, we examine 10 verification methods that could detect two types of potential violations: unauthorized AI training (e.g., training runs above a certain FLOP threshold) and unauthorized data centers. We divide the verification methods into three categories: (a) national technical means (methods requiring minimal or no access from suspected non-compliant nations), (b) access-dependent methods (methods that require approval from the nation suspected of unauthorized activities), and (c) hardware-dependent methods (methods that require rules around advanced hardware). For each verification method, we provide a description, historical precedents, and possible evasion techniques. We conclude by offering recommendations for future work related to the verification and enforcement of international AI governance agreements.",
    "summary": "This paper analyzes ten verification methods for ensuring compliance with international AI agreements, categorizing them by access requirements (national technical means, access-dependent, and hardware-dependent), and assessing their effectiveness against potential violations like excessive AI training or unauthorized data centers. The authors also discuss evasion techniques and suggest future research directions."

    "title": "Incorporation of Verifier Functionality in the Software for Operations and Network Attack Results Review and the Autonomous Penetration Testing System",
    "published_date": "2024-09-13",
    "abstract": "The software for operations and network attack results review (SONARR) and the autonomous penetration testing system (APTS) use facts and common properties in digital twin networks to represent real-world entities. However, in some cases fact values will change regularly, making it difficult for objects in SONARR and APTS to consistently and accurately represent their real-world counterparts. This paper proposes and evaluates the addition of verifiers, which check real-world conditions and update network facts, to SONARR. This inclusion allows SONARR to retrieve fact values from its executing environment and update its network, providing a consistent method of ensuring that the operations and, therefore, the results align with the real-world systems being assessed. Verifiers allow arbitrary scripts and dynamic arguments to be added to normal SONARR operations. This provides a layer of flexibility and consistency that results in more reliable output from the software.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes incorporating \"verifiers\" into the Software for Operations and Network Attack Results Review (SONARR) system to dynamically update its representation of real-world network conditions, ensuring consistency between the digital twin and the actual environment during penetration testing. This improves the reliability of SONARR's output by allowing for real-time fact verification and updates."

    "title": "Formal Verification of Permission Voucher",
    "published_date": "2024-12-18",
    "abstract": "Formal verification is a critical process in ensuring the security and correctness of cryptographic protocols, particularly in high-assurance domains. This paper presents a comprehensive formal analysis of the Permission Voucher Protocol, a system designed for secure and authenticated access control in distributed environments. The analysis employs the Tamarin Prover, a state-of-the-art tool for symbolic verification, to evaluate key security properties such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, mutual authentication, and replay prevention. We model the protocol's components, including trust relationships, secure channels, and adversary capabilities under the Dolev-Yao model. Verification results confirm the protocol's robustness against common attacks such as message tampering, impersonation, and replay. Additionally, dependency graphs and detailed proofs demonstrate the successful enforcement of security properties like voucher authenticity, data confidentiality, and key integrity. The study identifies potential enhancements, such as incorporating timestamp-based validity checks and augmenting mutual authentication mechanisms to address insider threats and key management challenges. This work highlights the advantages and limitations of using the Tamarin Prover for formal security verification and proposes strategies to mitigate scalability and performance constraints in complex systems.",
    "summary": "This paper formally verifies the security of the Permission Voucher Protocol using the Tamarin Prover, confirming its resistance to various attacks and identifying areas for improvement in its design. The analysis demonstrates the protocol's adherence to key security properties like authentication and confidentiality, while also highlighting the tool's capabilities and limitations."

    "title": "Meta-Sealing: A Revolutionizing Integrity Assurance Protocol for Transparent, Tamper-Proof, and Trustworthy AI System",
    "published_date": "2024-10-31",
    "abstract": "The Artificial intelligence in critical sectors-healthcare, finance, and public safety-has made system integrity paramount for maintaining societal trust. Current verification methods for AI systems lack comprehensive lifecycle assurance, creating significant vulnerabilities in deployment of both powerful and trustworthy AI. This research introduces Meta-Sealing, a cryptographic framework that fundamentally changes integrity verification in AI systems throughout their operational lifetime. Meta-Sealing surpasses traditional integrity protocols through its implementation of cryptographic seal chains, establishing verifiable, immutable records for all system decisions and transformations. The framework combines advanced cryptography with distributed verification, delivering tamper-evident guarantees that achieve both mathematical rigor and computational efficiency. Our implementation addresses urgent regulatory requirements for AI system transparency and auditability. The framework integrates with current AI governance standards, specifically the EU's AI Act and FDA's healthcare AI guidelines, enabling organizations to maintain operational efficiency while meeting compliance requirements. Testing on financial institution data demonstrated Meta-Sealing's capability to reduce audit timeframes by 62% while enhancing stakeholder confidence by 47%. Results can establish a new benchmark for integrity assurance in enterprise AI deployments. This research presents Meta-Sealing not merely as a technical solution, but as a foundational framework ensuring AI system integrity aligns with human values and regulatory requirements. As AI continues to influence critical decisions, provides the necessary bridge between technological advancement and verifiable trust. Meta-Sealing serves as a guardian of trust, ensuring that the AI systems we depend on are as reliable and transparent as they are powerful.",
    "summary": "Meta-Sealing is a novel cryptographic framework providing comprehensive, tamper-proof integrity assurance for AI systems throughout their lifecycle, using cryptographic seal chains to create verifiable records of all system actions and significantly improving audit efficiency and stakeholder trust. It aligns with existing AI governance regulations, enhancing transparency and accountability."

    "title": "Nuclear Arms Control Verification and Lessons for AI Treaties",
    "published_date": "2023-04-08",
    "abstract": "Security risks from AI have motivated calls for international agreements that guardrail the technology. However, even if states could agree on what rules to set on AI, the problem of verifying compliance might make these agreements infeasible. To help clarify the difficulty of verifying agreements on AI$\\unicode{x2013}$and identify actions that might reduce this difficulty$\\unicode{x2013}$this report examines the case study of verification in nuclear arms control. We review the implementation, track records, and politics of verification across three types of nuclear arms control agreements. Then, we consider implications for the case of AI, especially AI development that relies on thousands of highly specialized chips. In this context, the case study suggests that, with certain preparations, the foreseeable challenges of verification would be reduced to levels that were successfully managed in nuclear arms control. To avoid even worse challenges, substantial preparations are needed: (1) developing privacy-preserving, secure, and acceptably priced methods for verifying the compliance of hardware, given inspection access; and (2) building an initial, incomplete verification system, with authorities and precedents that allow its gaps to be quickly closed if and when the political will arises.",

    "summary": "The paper analyzes nuclear arms control verification methods to illuminate the challenges of verifying AI arms control agreements, arguing that while difficult, achievable verification with sufficient preparation (including developing privacy-preserving verification methods and an initial, expandable verification system) is possible."

    "title": "VCTP: A Verifiable Credential-Based Trust Propagation Protocol for Personal Issuers in Self-Sovereign Identity Platforms",
    "published_date": "2023-07-01",
    "abstract": "Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an emerging identity system that facilitates secure credential issuance and verification without placing trust in any centralised authority. To bypass central trust, most SSI implementations place blockchain as a trusted mediator by placing credential transactions on-chain. Yet, existing SSI platforms face trust issues as all credential issuers in SSI are not supported with adequate trust. Current SSI solutions provide trust support to the officiated issuers (e.g., government agencies), who must follow a precise process to assess their credentials. However, there is no structured trust support for individuals of SSI who may attempt to issue a credential (e.g., letter of consent) in the context of business processes. Therefore, some risk-averse verifiers in the system may not accept the credentials from individual issuers to avoid carrying the cost of mishaps from potentially inadmissible credentials without reliance on a trusted agency. This paper proposes a trust propagation protocol that supports individual users to be trusted as verifiable issuers in the SSI platform by establishing a trust propagation credential template in the blockchain. Our approach utilises (i) the sanitizable signature scheme to propagate the required trust to an individual issuer, (ii) a voting mechanism to minimises the possibility of collusion. Our implementation demonstrates that the solution is both practical and performs well under varying system loads.",
    "summary": "VCTP is a new protocol enabling trust in individual credential issuers within Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) platforms, using a blockchain-based trust propagation credential and a sanitizable signature scheme to mitigate risks associated with untrusted personal issuers. A voting mechanism further minimizes the chance of collusion."

    "title": "Verifiable Privacy-Preserving Computing",
    "published_date": "2023-09-15",
    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving computation (PPC) methods, such as secure multiparty computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE), are deployed increasingly often to guarantee data confidentiality in computations over private, distributed data. Similarly, we observe a steep increase in the adoption of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to guarantee (public) verifiability of locally executed computations. We project that applications that are data intensive and require strong privacy guarantees, are also likely to require verifiable correctness guarantees, especially when outsourced. While the combination of methods for verifiability and privacy protection has clear benefits, certain challenges stand before their widespread practical adoption. In this work, we analyze existing solutions that combine verifiability with privacy-preserving computations over distributed data, in order to preserve confidentiality and guarantee correctness at the same time. We classify and compare 37 different schemes, regarding solution approach, security, efficiency, and practicality. Lastly, we discuss some of the most promising solutions in this regard, and present various open challenges and directions for future research.",

    "summary": "This paper analyzes 37 schemes combining privacy-preserving computation (like MPC and HE) with zero-knowledge proofs to achieve both data confidentiality and verifiable computation correctness, classifying them and highlighting promising solutions and future research directions."
