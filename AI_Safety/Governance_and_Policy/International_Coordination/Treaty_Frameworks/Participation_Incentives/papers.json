    "published_date": "2023-10-30",
    "summary": "Military institutions have long utilized psychological research in warfare, and information warfare, increasingly crucial in the modern era, focuses on influencing high-intelligence elites rather than the general population, leveraging advanced psychological techniques that are rapidly improving."

    "title": "Rewarding in International Law",
    "abstract": "Abstract Why states comply with international law has long been at the forefront of international law and international relations scholarship. The compliance discussion has largely focused on negative incentives. We argue that there is another, undertheorized mechanism: rewarding. We provide a typology and illustrations of how rewards can be applied. Furthermore, we explore the rationale, potential, and limitations of rewarding, drawing on rationalist and psychological approaches. Both approaches provide ample justifications for making greater use of rewarding in international law.",

    "summary": "This paper argues that rewarding compliance, an understudied mechanism, is a significant factor in states' adherence to international law, offering a typology of rewards and exploring their rationale and limitations using rationalist and psychological frameworks. It contends that greater use of rewards is justified by both approaches."

    "published_date": "2021-05-26",
    "summary": "The article analyzes a potential future US-China conflict, assuming no strong AI or nuclear weapons. It posits that a Taiwanese independence declaration could trigger a war, where China's economic and geographic advantages, despite US naval superiority, could pose a significant challenge to American interests in maintaining the liberal world order."

    "title": "Democracy and Compliance in Public Goods Games",
    "abstract": "I investigate if, how, and why the effect of a contribution rule in a public goods game depends on how it is implemented: endogenously chosen or externally imposed. The rule prescribes full contributions to the public good backed by a nondeterrent sanction for those who do not comply. My experimental design allows me to disentangle to what extent the effect of the contribution rule under democracy is driven by self-selection of treatments, information transmitted via the outcome of the \nreferendum, and democracy per se. In case treatments are endogenously chosen via a democratic decision-making process, the contribution rule significantly increases contributions to the public good. However, democratic participation does not affect participants' contribution behavior directly, after controlling for self-selection of treatments and the information transmitted by voting.",

    "summary": "A public goods game experiment revealed that endogenously chosen (democratic) full-contribution rules significantly increased contributions, but this effect stemmed from self-selection and information revealed through voting, not direct democratic influence on behavior."

    "published_date": "2018-08-12",
    "summary": "This paper argues for a dedicated field of study focusing on the long-term trajectories of human civilization, identifying four potential paths: status quo, catastrophe, technological transformation, and astronomical expansion. The authors contend that current actions significantly influence these future trajectories, highlighting the need for informed decision-making based on both empirical evidence and ethical considerations."

    "published_date": "2018-11-06",
    "summary": "Nick Bostrom's \"The Vulnerable World Hypothesis\" argues that continued technological development significantly increases the likelihood of civilizational collapse unless global governance improves. This risk stems from various vulnerabilities, categorized by the ease of causing devastation and the incentives driving harmful actions, highlighting the need for stronger preventative measures and global cooperation."
