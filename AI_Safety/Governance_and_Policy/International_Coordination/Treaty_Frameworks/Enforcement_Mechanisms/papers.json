    "title": "Verification methods for international AI agreements",
    "published_date": "2024-08-28",
    "abstract": "What techniques can be used to verify compliance with international agreements about advanced AI development? In this paper, we examine 10 verification methods that could detect two types of potential violations: unauthorized AI training (e.g., training runs above a certain FLOP threshold) and unauthorized data centers. We divide the verification methods into three categories: (a) national technical means (methods requiring minimal or no access from suspected non-compliant nations), (b) access-dependent methods (methods that require approval from the nation suspected of unauthorized activities), and (c) hardware-dependent methods (methods that require rules around advanced hardware). For each verification method, we provide a description, historical precedents, and possible evasion techniques. We conclude by offering recommendations for future work related to the verification and enforcement of international AI governance agreements.",
    "summary": "This paper analyzes ten verification methods for ensuring compliance with international AI agreements, categorizing them by required access level (national technical means, access-dependent, and hardware-dependent), and assessing their effectiveness against potential evasion techniques. The study aims to inform future work on verification and enforcement of AI governance."

    "title": "International Governance of Civilian AI: A Jurisdictional Certification Approach",
    "published_date": "2023-08-29",
    "abstract": "This report describes trade-offs in the design of international governance arrangements for civilian artificial intelligence (AI) and presents one approach in detail. This approach represents the extension of a standards, licensing, and liability regime to the global level. We propose that states establish an International AI Organization (IAIO) to certify state jurisdictions (not firms or AI projects) for compliance with international oversight standards. States can give force to these international standards by adopting regulations prohibiting the import of goods whose supply chains embody AI from non-IAIO-certified jurisdictions. This borrows attributes from models of existing international organizations, such as the International Civilian Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). States can also adopt multilateral controls on the export of AI product inputs, such as specialized hardware, to non-certified jurisdictions. Indeed, both the import and export standards could be required for certification. As international actors reach consensus on risks of and minimum standards for advanced AI, a jurisdictional certification regime could mitigate a broad range of potential harms, including threats to public safety.",

    "summary": "This report proposes an international governance model for civilian AI involving an International AI Organization (IAIO) that certifies national jurisdictions based on compliance with international AI standards, leveraging import/export controls to incentivize participation and mitigate potential harms. This approach extends existing international organizational models to address global AI risks."

    "abstract": "This paper presents research on a prototype developed to serve the quantitative study of public policy design. This sub-discipline of political science focuses on identifying actors, relations between them, and tools at their disposal in health, environmental, economic, and other policies. Our system aims to automate the process of gathering legal documents, annotating them with Institutional Grammar, and using hypergraphs to analyse inter-relations between crucial entities. Our system is tested against the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage from 2003, a legal document regulating essential aspects of international relations securing cultural heritage.",

    "title": "From Legal Contracts to Legal Calculi: the code-driven normativity",
    "published_date": "2022-08-29",
    "abstract": "Using dedicated software to represent or enact legislation or regulation has the advantage of solving the inherent ambiguity of legal texts and enabling the automation of compliance with legal norms. On the other hand, the so-called code-driven normativity is less flexible than the legal provisions it claims to implement, and transforms the nature of legal protection, potentially reducing the capability of individual human beings to invoke legal remedies. In this article we focus on software-based legal contracts; we illustrate the design of a legal calculus whose primitives allow a direct formalisation of contracts' normative elements (i.e., permissions, prohibitions, obligations, asset transfer, judicial enforcement and openness to the external context). We show that interpreting legal contracts as interaction protocols between (untrusted) parties enables the generalisation of formal methods and tools for concurrent systems to the legal setting",
    "citation_count": 2,
    "summary": "This paper explores the use of software to formalize legal contracts, creating \"legal calculi\" that reduce ambiguity and automate compliance, but also potentially limit flexibility and individual legal recourse. The authors propose a design for such a calculus based on representing contracts as interaction protocols."

    "published_date": "2022-09-11",
    "summary": "Due to survival bias, we may underestimate the likelihood and proximity of climate tipping points, making Earth more vulnerable to human-caused climate catastrophe than previously thought. This \"anthropic fragility\" suggests a higher probability of runaway global warming and necessitates urgent research into geoengineering solutions."
