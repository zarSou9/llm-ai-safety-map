### Mini Description

Frameworks for categorizing different types of AI safety information and determining appropriate sharing requirements, restrictions, and access levels for each category.

### Description

Information classification in AI safety focuses on developing systematic approaches to categorizing and organizing different types of AI-related information based on their sensitivity, strategic importance, and sharing requirements. This includes establishing clear criteria for determining classification levels, defining access protocols, and creating standardized taxonomies that can be consistently applied across different organizations and jurisdictions.

A key challenge is balancing the granularity of classification schemes against their practical usability. Too fine-grained classifications can become unwieldy and difficult to implement, while overly broad categories may fail to capture important nuances in information sensitivity. Research explores methods for dynamic classification that can adapt to evolving AI capabilities and changing strategic landscapes, while maintaining consistency and interoperability across different sharing frameworks.

Current work emphasizes developing classification schemes that account for both traditional security considerations (like national security and commercial secrets) and AI-specific factors such as potential dual-use applications, capability implications, and safety risks. This includes research on automated classification tools, methods for handling information with multiple sensitivity dimensions, and approaches for managing the temporal aspects of classification where information sensitivity may change over time.
