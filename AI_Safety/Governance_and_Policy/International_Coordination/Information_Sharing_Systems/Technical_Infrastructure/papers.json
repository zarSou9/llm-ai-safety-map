    "published_date": "2023-04-01",
    "summary": "The article discusses the significant security risks associated with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) development, emphasizing the potential for preemptive cyberattacks by nation-states fearing an AGI arms race. These attacks, unlike traditional kinetic warfare, are harder to attribute and could lead to increased global instability due to the proliferation of zero-day exploits and the inherent vulnerabilities within existing computer systems."

    "title": "A Data Sharing Scheme Based on Blockchain System and Attribute-Based Encryption",
    "abstract": "Blockchain systems offer a decentralized, immutable and transparent architecture that can give the ownership and control of data back to users, empower trusted and accountable data sharing. However, there still exist different scalability, security and potential privacy issues in blockchain networks, such as on-chain data privacy, data origin authentication, or compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving and user-controlled architecture for data sharing based on blockchain system and Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE), called ThemisABE. The proposed scheme has properties including one-to-many data encrypting and fined-grained access control. In the ThemisABE, any party can be an authority and the algorithm of CP-ABE generates the secret key corresponding to attributes for data user through any chosen set of nodes in blockchain system. Moreover, in order to realize accountability of CP-ABE algorithm and avoid performance bottleneck incurred by smart contracts, a kind of data structure of transactions is designed to record in the ledger, following an approaches to off-chain computations. The results of security analysis and experimental simulation show that the proposed scheme can solves the problems of privacy security and localization of data sharing. At the same time, the data sharing scheme has better performance and could be applied in some scenarios, such as eHealth, eGovernment or cross-border paperless trade.",

    "title": "Introduction to Secure Collaborative Intelligence (SCI) Lab",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of technology, user privacy and data security are drawing much attention over the recent years. On one hand, how to protect user privacy while making use of customers? data is a challenging task. On the other hand, data silos are becoming one of the most prominent issues for the society. How to bridge these isolated data islands to build better AI and BI systems while meeting the data privacy and regulatory compliance requirements has imposed great challenges. Secure Collaborative Intelligence (SCI) lab at Ant Group dedicates to leverage multiple privacy-preserving technologies on AI and BI to solve these challenges. The goal of SCI lab is to build enterprise-level solutions that allow multiple data owners to achieve joint risk control, joint marketing, joint data analysis and other cross-organization collaboration scenarios without compromising information privacy or violating any related security policy. Compared with other solution providers, SCI lab has been working with top universities and research organizations to build the first privacy-preserving open platform for collaborative intelligence computation in the world. It is the first platform that combines all three cutting-edge privacy-preserving technologies, secure multi-party computation (MPC), differential privacy (DP) and trusted execution environment (TEE) that are based on cryptography, information theory and computer hardware respectively, on multi-party AI and BI collaboration scenarios. During multi-party collaboration, all inputs, computations and results are protected under specific security policy dedicatedly designed for each data owner. At this time, the platform has been applied to various business scenarios in Ant group and Alibaba Group, including joint lending, collaborative data analysis, joint payment fraud detection, etc. More than 20 financial organizations, have been benefited from the secure data collaboration and computing services provided by SCI lab.",
