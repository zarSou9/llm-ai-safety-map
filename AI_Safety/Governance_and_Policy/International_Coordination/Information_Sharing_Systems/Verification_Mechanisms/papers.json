    "title": "Formal Verification of Digital Twins with TLA and Information Leakage Control",
    "published_date": "2024-11-27",
    "abstract": "Verifying the correctness of a digital twin provides a formal guarantee that the digital twin operates as intended. Digital twin verification is challenging due to the presence of uncertainties in the virtual representation, the physical environment, and the bidirectional flow of information between physical and virtual. A further challenge is that a digital twin of a complex system is composed of distributed components. This paper presents a methodology to specify and verify digital twin behavior, translating uncertain processes into a formally verifiable finite state machine. We use the Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) to create a specification, an implementation abstraction that defines the properties required for correct system behavior. Our approach includes a novel weakening of formal security properties, allowing controlled information leakage while preserving theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate this approach on a digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle, verifying synchronization of physical-to-virtual and virtual-to-digital data flows to detect unintended misalignments.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a TLA-based methodology for formally verifying digital twin behavior, addressing challenges posed by uncertainties and distributed components, and incorporating a novel approach to control information leakage while maintaining correctness guarantees. The method is demonstrated on an unmanned aerial vehicle digital twin, verifying data synchronization between physical and virtual components."

    "title": "It Takes Two: A Peer-Prediction Solution for Blockchain Verifier's Dilemma",
    "published_date": "2024-06-03",
    "abstract": "The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the process of content verification is essential to keep the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a secure blockchain system with few or no cheaters could not provide sufficient incentive for verifiers to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could severely undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems. While existing works have attempted to insert deliberate errors to disincentivize lazy verification, the decentralized environment makes it impossible to judge the correctness of verification or detect malicious verifiers directly. In this paper, we initiate the research that leverages the peer prediction approach towards the design of Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification game among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations in the verification process. With theoretically guaranteed truthfulness of our mechanism for the verification game, our work provides a framework of verification mechanisms that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain and potentially other decentralized systems.",

The mechanism's Bayesian design guarantees truthful verification, enhancing blockchain security."

    "title": "Formal Verification of Permission Voucher",
    "published_date": "2024-12-18",
    "abstract": "Formal verification is a critical process in ensuring the security and correctness of cryptographic protocols, particularly in high-assurance domains. This paper presents a comprehensive formal analysis of the Permission Voucher Protocol, a system designed for secure and authenticated access control in distributed environments. The analysis employs the Tamarin Prover, a state-of-the-art tool for symbolic verification, to evaluate key security properties such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, mutual authentication, and replay prevention. We model the protocol's components, including trust relationships, secure channels, and adversary capabilities under the Dolev-Yao model. Verification results confirm the protocol's robustness against common attacks such as message tampering, impersonation, and replay. Additionally, dependency graphs and detailed proofs demonstrate the successful enforcement of security properties like voucher authenticity, data confidentiality, and key integrity. The study identifies potential enhancements, such as incorporating timestamp-based validity checks and augmenting mutual authentication mechanisms to address insider threats and key management challenges. This work highlights the advantages and limitations of using the Tamarin Prover for formal security verification and proposes strategies to mitigate scalability and performance constraints in complex systems.",
    "summary": "This paper formally verifies the security of the Permission Voucher Protocol using the Tamarin Prover, confirming its resistance to various attacks and highlighting areas for improvement in key management and insider threat mitigation. The analysis focuses on properties like authentication, confidentiality, and integrity."

    "published_date": "2024-10-31",
    "abstract": "The Artificial intelligence in critical sectors-healthcare, finance, and public safety-has made system integrity paramount for maintaining societal trust. Current verification methods for AI systems lack comprehensive lifecycle assurance, creating significant vulnerabilities in deployment of both powerful and trustworthy AI. This research introduces Meta-Sealing, a cryptographic framework that fundamentally changes integrity verification in AI systems throughout their operational lifetime. Meta-Sealing surpasses traditional integrity protocols through its implementation of cryptographic seal chains, establishing verifiable, immutable records for all system decisions and transformations. The framework combines advanced cryptography with distributed verification, delivering tamper-evident guarantees that achieve both mathematical rigor and computational efficiency. Our implementation addresses urgent regulatory requirements for AI system transparency and auditability. The framework integrates with current AI governance standards, specifically the EU's AI Act and FDA's healthcare AI guidelines, enabling organizations to maintain operational efficiency while meeting compliance requirements. Testing on financial institution data demonstrated Meta-Sealing's capability to reduce audit timeframes by 62% while enhancing stakeholder confidence by 47%. Results can establish a new benchmark for integrity assurance in enterprise AI deployments. This research presents Meta-Sealing not merely as a technical solution, but as a foundational framework ensuring AI system integrity aligns with human values and regulatory requirements. As AI continues to influence critical decisions, provides the necessary bridge between technological advancement and verifiable trust. Meta-Sealing serves as a guardian of trust, ensuring that the AI systems we depend on are as reliable and transparent as they are powerful.",
    "summary": "Meta-Sealing is a novel cryptographic framework providing comprehensive, tamper-evident integrity assurance for AI systems throughout their lifecycle, using cryptographic seal chains to create verifiable records of all system actions and significantly improving audit efficiency and stakeholder trust.

    "title": "EVeCA: Efficient and Verifiable On-Chain Data Query Framework Using Challenge-Based Authentication",
    "published_date": "2024-10-31",
    "abstract": "As blockchain applications become increasingly widespread, there is a rising demand for on-chain data queries. However, existing schemes for on-chain data queries face a challenge between verifiability and efficiency. Queries on blockchain databases can compromise the authenticity of the query results, while schemes that utilize on-chain Authenticated Data Structure (ADS) have lower efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient and verifiable on-chain data query framework EVeCA. In our approach, we free the full nodes from the task of ADS maintenance by delegating it to a limited number of nodes, and full nodes verify the correctness of ADS by using challenge-based authentication scheme instead of reconstructing them, which prevents the service providers from maintaining incorrect ADS with overwhelming probability. By carefully designing the ADS verification scheme, EVeCA achieves higher efficiency while remaining resilient against adaptive attacks. Our framework effectively eliminates the need for on-chain ADS maintenance, and allows full nodes to participate in ADS maintenance in a cost-effective way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through security analysis and experimental evaluation. Compared to existing schemes, our approach improves ADS maintenance efficiency by about 20*.",
    "summary": "EVeCA is a blockchain data query framework that improves efficiency by delegating Authenticated Data Structure (ADS) maintenance to a limited number of nodes and using challenge-based authentication for verification, thereby preventing manipulation and enhancing performance compared to existing methods. This approach achieves approximately a 20% improvement in ADS maintenance efficiency."

    "title": "Validation of the Results of Cross-chain Smart Contract Based on Confirmation Method",
    "published_date": "2024-08-19",
    "abstract": "Smart contracts are widely utilized in cross-chain interactions, where their results are transmitted from one blockchain (the producer blockchain) to another (the consumer blockchain). Unfortunately, the consumer blockchain often accepts these results without executing the smart contracts for validation, posing potential security risks. To address this, we propose a method for validating cross-chain smart contract results. Our approach emphasizes consumer blockchain execution of cross-chain smart contracts of producer blockchain, allowing comparison of results with the transmitted ones to detect potential discrepancies and ensure data integrity during cross-chain data dissemination. Additionally, we introduce the confirmation with proof method, which involves incorporating the chain of blocks and relevant cross-chain smart contract data from the producer blockchain into the consumer blockchain as evidence (or proof), establishing a unified and secure perspective of cross-chain smart contract results. Our verification results highlight the feasibility of cross-chain validation at the smart contract level.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a method for validating cross-chain smart contract results by having the consumer blockchain re-execute the smart contract and compare its output to the transmitted result, enhancing security. The method also incorporates a \"confirmation with proof\" approach, using blockchain data from the producer chain as evidence on the consumer chain."

    "published_date": "2023-09-15",
    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving computation (PPC) methods, such as secure multiparty computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE), are deployed increasingly often to guarantee data confidentiality in computations over private, distributed data. Similarly, we observe a steep increase in the adoption of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to guarantee (public) verifiability of locally executed computations. We project that applications that are data intensive and require strong privacy guarantees, are also likely to require verifiable correctness guarantees, especially when outsourced. While the combination of methods for verifiability and privacy protection has clear benefits, certain challenges stand before their widespread practical adoption. In this work, we analyze existing solutions that combine verifiability with privacy-preserving computations over distributed data, in order to preserve confidentiality and guarantee correctness at the same time. We classify and compare 37 different schemes, regarding solution approach, security, efficiency, and practicality. Lastly, we discuss some of the most promising solutions in this regard, and present various open challenges and directions for future research.",
