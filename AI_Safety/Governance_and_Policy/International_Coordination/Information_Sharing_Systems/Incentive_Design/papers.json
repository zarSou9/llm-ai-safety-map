    "title": "Information Disclosure under Competition in Sharing Systems",
    "published_date": "2023-08-30",
    "abstract": "Sharing systems have facilitated the redistribution of underused resources by providing convenient online marketplaces for individual sellers and buyers. However, sellers in these systems may not fully disclose the information of their shared commodities, due to strategic behaviors or privacy concerns. Sellers' strategic information disclosure significantly affects buyers' user experiences and systems' reputation. This paper presents the first analytical study on information disclosure and pricing of competing sellers in sharing systems. In particular, we propose a two-stage game framework to capture sellers' strategic behaviors and buyers' decisions. Although the optimization problem is challenging due to sellers' non-convex and non-monotonic objectives, we completely characterize the complex market equilibria by decomposing it into several tractable subproblems. We demonstrate that full disclosure by all sellers or non-disclosure by all sellers will both lead to intense price competition. The former all-disclosure case is never an equilibrium even when all sellers have good commodity qualities and low privacy costs, while the latter non-disclosure case can be an equilibrium under which all sellers get zero profit. We also reveal several critical factors that affect sellers' information disclosure. Interestingly, sellers' sharing capacity limitation and buyers' estimation biases encourage information disclosure as they mitigate sellers' competition.",
    "summary": "This paper analyzes information disclosure strategies of competing sellers in sharing systems using a two-stage game framework, revealing that neither full nor zero disclosure are stable equilibria, with the latter potentially resulting in zero profit for all sellers; factors like seller capacity and buyer biases influence the incentive to disclose information."

    "title": "To Incentivize or Not: Impact of Blockchain-Based Cryptoeconomic Tokens on Human Information Sharing Behavior",
    "published_date": "2022-05-10",
    "abstract": "Cryptoeconomic incentives in the form of blockchain-based tokens are seen as an enabler of the sharing economy that could shift society towards greater sustainability. Nevertheless, knowledge of the impact of these tokens on human sharing behavior is still limited and this poses a challenge to the design of effective cryptoeconomic incentives. This study applies the theory of self-determination to investigate the impact of such tokens on human behavior in an information-sharing scenario. By utilizing an experimental methodology in the form of a randomized control trial with a $2 \\times 2$ factorial design involving 132 participants, the effects of two token incentives on human information-sharing behavior are analyzed. Individuals obtain these tokens in exchange for their shared information. Based on the collected tokens, individuals receive a monetary payment and build reputation. Besides investigating the effect of these incentives on the quantity of shared information, the study includes quality characteristics of the information, such as accuracy and contextualization. The focus on quantity while excluding quality has been identified as a limitation in previous work. In addition to confirming previously known effects such as a crowding-out of intrinsic motivation by incentives, which also exists for blockchain-based tokens, the findings of this paper point to a hitherto unreported interaction effect between multiple tokens when applied simultaneously. The findings are critically discussed and put into the context of recent work and ethical considerations. The theory-based-empirical study is of interest to those investigating the effect of cryptoeconomic tokens or digital currencies on human behavior and supports the community in the design of effective personalized incentives for sharing economies.",

    "summary": "This study uses a randomized controlled trial to investigate how blockchain-based token incentives affect information sharing, finding that while they increase quantity, they can crowd out intrinsic motivation and that using multiple tokens simultaneously produces an unexpected interaction effect. The results inform the design of effective, personalized incentives in sharing economies."

    "title": "Joint Information and Mechanism Design for Queues with Heterogeneous Users",
    "published_date": "2021-09-29",
    "abstract": "We consider a queue with an unobservable backlog by the incoming users. There is an information designer that observes the queue backlog and makes recommendations to the users arriving at the queue whether to join or not to join the queue. The arriving users have payoff relevant private types. The users, upon arrival, send a message, that is supposed to be their type, to the information designer if they are willing to hear a recommendation. The information designer then creates a recommendation for that specific type of user. The users have to pay a tax in exchange for the information they receive. In this setting, the information designer has two types of commitments. The first commitment is the recommendation policy and the second commitment is the tax function. We combine mechanism design and information design to study a queuing system with heterogeneous users. In this setting, the information designer is a sender of the information in the information design aspect and a receiver in the mechanism design aspect of the model. We formulate an optimization problem that characterizes the solution of the joint design problem. We characterize the tax functions and provide structural results for the recommendation policy of the information designer.",

    "summary": "This paper uses a joint information and mechanism design approach to optimize a queueing system with heterogeneous users, where an information designer provides join/no-join recommendations to users based on their private types and the unobservable queue backlog, charging a tax for this information. The authors characterize optimal tax functions and recommendation policies."

    "title": "User incentives for blockchain-based data sharing platforms",
    "published_date": "2021-10-21",
    "abstract": "Data sharing is very important for accelerating scientific research, business innovations, and for informing individuals. Yet, concerns over data privacy, cost, and lack of secure data-sharing solutions have prevented data owners from sharing data. To overcome these issues, several research works have proposed blockchain-based data-sharing solutions for their ability to add transparency and control to the data-sharing process. Yet, while models for decentralized data sharing exist, how to incentivize these structures to enable data sharing at scale remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study different incentive mechanisms for decentralized data-sharing platforms. Smart contracts are used to automate different payment options between data owners and data requesters. We evaluate multiple cost pricing scenarios for data monetization by simulating incentive mechanisms on a blockchain-based data-sharing platform. We show that a cost compensation model for the data owner rapidly cover the cost of data sharing and balance the overall incentives for all the actors in the platform.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates incentive mechanisms for blockchain-based data sharing platforms, using smart contracts to automate payments and simulating various cost pricing models to determine which best incentivizes data owners and requesters. A cost compensation model for data owners is shown to be particularly effective in promoting large-scale data sharing."

    "title": "Optimal Procurement Auction for Cooperative Production of Virtual Products: Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Meet Cremer-McLean",
    "published_date": "2020-07-29",
    "abstract": "We set up a supply-side game-theoretic model for the cooperative production of virtual products. In our model, a group of producers collaboratively produce a virtual product by contributing costly input resources to a production coalition. Producers are capacitated, i.e., they cannot contribute more resources than their capacity limits. Our model is an abstraction of emerging internet-based business models such as federated learning and crowd computing. To maintain an efficient and stable production coalition, the coordinator should share with producers the income brought by the virtual product. Besides the demand-side information asymmetry, another two sources of supply-side information asymmetry intertwined in this problem: 1) the capacity limit of each producer and 2) the cost incurred to each producer. In this paper, we rigorously prove that a supply-side mechanism from the VCG family, PVCG, can overcome such multiple information asymmetry and guarantee truthfulness. Furthermore, with some reasonable assumptions, PVCG simultaneously attains truthfulness, ex-post allocative efficiency, ex-post individual rationality, and ex-post weak budget balancedness on the supply side, easing the well-known tension between these four objectives in the mechanism design literature.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) based mechanism, PVCG, for efficient cooperative virtual product production, addressing supply-side information asymmetry regarding producer capacities and costs. PVCG achieves truthfulness, allocative efficiency, individual rationality, and weak budget balance under reasonable assumptions."

    "title": "Egoistic Incentives Based on Zero-Determinant Alliances for Large-Scale Systems",
    "published_date": "2020-01-08",
    "abstract": "Social dilemmas exist in various fields and give rise to the so-called free-riding problem, leading to collective fiascos. The difficulty of tracking individual behaviors makes egoistic incentives in large-scale systems a challenging task. However, the state-of-the-art mechanisms are either individual-based or state-dependent, resulting in low efficiency in large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose an egoistic incentive mechanism from a connected (network) perspective rather than an isolated (individual) perspective by taking advantage of the social nature of people. We make use of a zero-determinant (ZD) strategy for rewarding cooperation and sanctioning defection. After proving cooperation is the dominant strategy for ZD players, we optimize their deployment to facilitate cooperation over the whole system. To further speed up cooperation, we derive a ZD alliance strategy for sequential multiple-player repeated games to empower ZD players with higher controllable leverage, which undoubtedly enriches the theoretical system of ZD strategies and broadens their application domain. Our approach is stateless and stable, which contributes to its scalability. Extensive simulations based on a real world trace data as well as synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed egoistic incentive approach under different networking scenarios.",
    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel egoistic incentive mechanism for large-scale systems, leveraging zero-determinant (ZD) strategies to promote cooperation by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection within a network context, thereby overcoming limitations of individual-based or state-dependent approaches. The mechanism's scalability is ensured through its stateless and stable design, demonstrated effective via simulations."

    "title": "User Data Sharing Frameworks: A Blockchain-Based Incentive Solution",
    "published_date": "2019-10-01",
    "abstract": "Currently, there is no universal method to track who shared what, with whom, when and for what purposes in a verifiable way to create an individual incentive for data owners. A platform that allows data owners to control, delete, and get rewards from sharing their data would be an important enabler of user data-sharing. We propose a usable blockchain- and smart contracts-based framework that allows users to store research data locally and share without losing control and ownership of it. We have created smart contracts for building automatic verification of the conditions for data access that also naturally supports building up a verifiable record of the provenance, incentives for users to share their data and accountability of access. The paper presents a review of the existing work of research data sharing, the proposed blockchain-based framework and an evaluation of the framework by measuring the transaction cost for smart contracts deployment. The results show that nodes responded quickly in all tested cases with a befitting transaction cost.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a blockchain-based framework using smart contracts to incentivize user data sharing while maintaining user control and verifiable provenance, addressing the current lack of transparent and rewarding data sharing mechanisms. The framework's feasibility is evaluated through measurement of smart contract deployment transaction costs."

    "title": "Efficient Network Sharing With Asymmetric Constraint Information",
    "published_date": "2019-01-29",
    "abstract": "Network sharing has become a key feature of various enablers of the next-generation network, such as network function virtualization and fog computing architectures. Network utility maximization (NUM) is a general framework for achieving fair, efficient, and cost-effective sharing of constrained network resources. When agents have asymmetric and private information, however, a fundamental economic challenge is how to solve the NUM problem considering the self-interests of strategic agents. Many previous related works have proposed economic mechanisms that can cope with agents' private utilities. However, the network sharing paradigm introduces the issue of information asymmetries regarding constraints. The related literature largely neglected such an issue; limited closely related studies provided solutions only applicable to specific application scenarios. To tackle these issues, we propose the Decomposable NUM (DeNUM) mechanism and the Dynamic DeNUM (DyDeNUM) mechanism, the first mechanisms in the literature for solving NUM problems considering private utility and constraint information. The key idea of both mechanisms is to decentralize the decision process to agents, who will make resource allocation decisions without the need of revealing private information to others. Under a monitorable influence assumption, the DeNUM mechanism yields the network-utility maximizing solution at an equilibrium and achieves other desirable economic properties (such as individual rationality and budget balance). We further establish the connection between the equilibrium structure and the primal–dual solution to a related optimization problem, based on which we prove the convergence of the DeNUM algorithm to an equilibrium. When the agents' influences are not monitorable, we propose the DyDeNUM mechanism that yields the network-utility maximizing solution at the cost of the balanced budget. Finally, as a case study, we apply the proposed mechanisms to solving the NUM problem for a fog-based user-provided network and show that both mechanisms improve the network utility by 34% compared to a non-cooperation benchmark.",
    "citation_count": 10,
    "summary": "This paper introduces DeNUM and DyDeNUM, novel mechanisms for solving network utility maximization problems where agents possess private utility and constraint information, achieving efficient resource allocation without requiring information revelation. These mechanisms are shown to improve network utility significantly compared to non-cooperative approaches."
