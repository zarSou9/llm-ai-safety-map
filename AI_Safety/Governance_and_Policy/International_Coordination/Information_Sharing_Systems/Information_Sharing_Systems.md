### Mini Description

Design of mechanisms for countries to share safety-critical information about AI development while protecting sensitive intellectual property and national security interests.

### Description

Information sharing systems in AI safety focus on creating secure and effective mechanisms for countries, organizations, and researchers to exchange critical information about AI development, safety incidents, and best practices. These systems must balance the competing needs of transparency for safety oversight with protection of intellectual property, national security interests, and competitive advantages. This includes both technical infrastructure for secure data sharing and institutional frameworks for determining what information should be shared and how.

A key challenge is designing incentive structures that encourage meaningful participation while preventing strategic withholding or manipulation of information. This requires careful consideration of verification mechanisms, reciprocity arrangements, and graduated information access levels. Research explores both centralized and distributed architectures for information sharing, examining trade-offs between coordination efficiency and system resilience.

Current work focuses on developing cryptographic protocols for secure multi-party computation, establishing common standards for incident reporting, and creating trusted verification mechanisms for shared information. There is particular emphasis on designing systems that remain effective under various scenarios of international tension or technological competition, while being adaptable to rapidly evolving AI capabilities and threats.
