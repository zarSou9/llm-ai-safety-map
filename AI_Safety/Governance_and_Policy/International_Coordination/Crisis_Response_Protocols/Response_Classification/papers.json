    "title": "Lessons for Editors of AI Incidents from the AI Incident Database",
    "published_date": "2024-09-24",
    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly deployed across the world, they are also increasingly implicated in AI incidents - harm events to individuals and society. As a result, industry, civil society, and governments worldwide are developing best practices and regulations for monitoring and analyzing AI incidents. The AI Incident Database (AIID) is a project that catalogs AI incidents and supports further research by providing a platform to classify incidents for different operational and research-oriented goals. This study reviews the AIID's dataset of 750+ AI incidents and two independent taxonomies applied to these incidents to identify common challenges to indexing and analyzing AI incidents. We find that certain patterns of AI incidents present structural ambiguities that challenge incident databasing and explore how epistemic uncertainty in AI incident reporting is unavoidable. We therefore report mitigations to make incident processes more robust to uncertainty related to cause, extent of harm, severity, or technical details of implicated systems. With these findings, we discuss how to develop future AI incident reporting practices.",

    "title": "AI Risk Categorization Decoded (AIR 2024): From Government Regulations to Corporate Policies",
    "published_date": "2024-06-25",
    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive AI risk taxonomy derived from eight government policies from the European Union, United States, and China and 16 company policies worldwide, making a significant step towards establishing a unified language for generative AI safety evaluation. We identify 314 unique risk categories organized into a four-tiered taxonomy. At the highest level, this taxonomy encompasses System&Operational Risks, Content Safety Risks, Societal Risks, and Legal&Rights Risks. The taxonomy establishes connections between various descriptions and approaches to risk, highlighting the overlaps and discrepancies between public and private sector conceptions of risk. By providing this unified framework, we aim to advance AI safety through information sharing across sectors and the promotion of best practices in risk mitigation for generative AI models and systems.",

    "title": "Games for AI Control: Models of Safety Evaluations of AI Deployment Protocols",
    "published_date": "2024-09-12",
    "abstract": "To evaluate the safety and usefulness of deployment protocols for untrusted AIs, AI Control uses a red-teaming exercise played between a protocol designer and an adversary. This paper introduces AI-Control Games, a formal decision-making model of the red-teaming exercise as a multi-objective, partially observable, stochastic game. We also introduce methods for finding optimal protocols in AI-Control Games, by reducing them to a set of zero-sum partially observable stochastic games. We apply our formalism to model, evaluate and synthesise protocols for deploying untrusted language models as programming assistants, focusing on Trusted Monitoring protocols, which use weaker language models and limited human assistance. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our formalism by showcasing improvements over empirical studies in existing settings, evaluating protocols in new settings, and analysing how modelling assumptions affect the safety and usefulness of protocols.",

    "published_date": "2024-11-13",
    "abstract": "As AI systems become integral to critical operations across industries and services, ensuring their reliability and safety is essential. We offer a framework that integrates established reliability and resilience engineering principles into AI systems. By applying traditional metrics such as failure rate and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) along with resilience engineering and human reliability analysis, we propose an integrate framework to manage AI system performance, and prevent or efficiently recover from failures. Our work adapts classical engineering methods to AI systems and outlines a research agenda for future technical studies. We apply our framework to a real-world AI system, using system status data from platforms such as openAI, to demonstrate its practical applicability. This framework aligns with emerging global standards and regulatory frameworks, providing a methodology to enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems. Our aim is to guide policy, regulation, and the development of reliable, safe, and adaptable AI technologies capable of consistent performance in real-world environments.",

    "title": "Safeguarding AI Agents: Developing and Analyzing Safety Architectures",
    "published_date": "2024-09-03",
    "abstract": "AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations. As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. We propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical delegation-based system with embedded safety checks. Our methodology involves implementing these frameworks and testing them against a set of unsafe agentic use cases, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with AI agent deployment. We conclude that these frameworks can significantly strengthen the safety and security of AI agent systems, minimizing potential harmful actions or outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to create safe and reliable AI applications, particularly in automated operations, and provides a foundation for developing robust guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI agents in real-world applications.",

    "title": "Dynamic safety cases for frontier AI",
    "published_date": "2024-12-23",
    "abstract": "Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) systems present both benefits and risks to society. Safety cases - structured arguments supported by evidence - are one way to help ensure the safe development and deployment of these systems. Yet the evolving nature of AI capabilities, as well as changes in the operational environment and understanding of risk, necessitates mechanisms for continuously updating these safety cases. Typically, in other sectors, safety cases are produced pre-deployment and do not require frequent updates post-deployment, which can be a manual, costly process. This paper proposes a Dynamic Safety Case Management System (DSCMS) to support both the initial creation of a safety case and its systematic, semi-automated revision over time. Drawing on methods developed in the autonomous vehicles (AV) sector - state-of-the-art Checkable Safety Arguments (CSA) combined with Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs) recommended by UL 4600, a DSCMS helps developers maintain alignment between system safety claims and the latest system state. We demonstrate this approach on a safety case template for offensive cyber capabilities and suggest ways it can be integrated into governance structures for safety-critical decision-making. While the correctness of the initial safety argument remains paramount - particularly for high-severity risks - a DSCMS provides a framework for adapting to new insights and strengthening incident response. We outline challenges and further work towards development and implementation of this approach as part of continuous safety assurance of frontier AI systems.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a Dynamic Safety Case Management System (DSCMS) for continuously updating safety cases of evolving frontier AI systems, leveraging semi-automated revisions based on Safety Performance Indicators and Checkable Safety Arguments to maintain alignment between system claims and operational realities. The DSCMS aims to improve safety assurance for high-risk AI applications."

We provide an extensive review of current research and advancements in AI safety from these perspectives, highlighting their key challenges and mitigation approaches. Through examples from state-of-the-art technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), we present innovative mechanism, methodologies, and techniques for designing and testing AI safety. Our goal is to promote advancement in AI safety research, and ultimately enhance people's trust in digital transformation.",
