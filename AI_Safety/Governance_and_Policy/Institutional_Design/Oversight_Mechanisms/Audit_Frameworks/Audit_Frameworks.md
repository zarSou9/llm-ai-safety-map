### Mini Description

Structured approaches and methodologies for conducting systematic reviews of AI systems, including evaluation criteria, testing procedures, and documentation requirements.

### Description

Audit frameworks for AI systems provide structured methodologies and protocols for systematically evaluating AI development processes, deployment practices, and system behaviors against established standards and requirements. These frameworks must balance thoroughness with practicality while accommodating the unique challenges posed by AI systems, such as their potential opacity, complex behavior patterns, and rapid evolution of capabilities.

Effective audit frameworks typically incorporate multiple layers of assessment, from technical evaluation of system components to organizational review of development practices and governance structures. Current research focuses on developing standardized audit procedures that can be consistently applied across different types of AI systems while remaining flexible enough to adapt to technological advances. This includes establishing clear documentation requirements, defining evidence standards, and creating reproducible testing protocols.

A key challenge in audit framework design is ensuring independence and objectivity while maintaining sufficient technical expertise to meaningfully assess advanced AI systems. This has led to exploration of various audit models, from traditional third-party certification to collaborative peer review approaches. Emerging research areas include developing audit procedures for increasingly complex AI architectures, establishing methods for continuous audit processes rather than point-in-time assessments, and creating frameworks that can effectively evaluate both technical and socio-technical aspects of AI systems.
