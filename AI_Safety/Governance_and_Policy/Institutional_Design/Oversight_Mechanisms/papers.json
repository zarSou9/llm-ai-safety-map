    "title": "Visibility into AI Agents",
    "published_date": "2024-01-23",
    "abstract": "Increased delegation of commercial, scientific, governmental, and personal activities to AI agents—systems capable of pursuing complex goals with limited supervision—may exacerbate existing societal risks and introduce new risks. Understanding and mitigating these risks involves critically evaluating existing governance structures, revising and adapting these structures where needed, and ensuring accountability of key stakeholders. Information about where, why, how, and by whom certain AI agents are used, which we refer to as visibility, is critical to these objectives. In this paper, we assess three categories of measures to increase visibility into AI agents: agent identifiers, real-time monitoring, and activity logging. For each, we outline potential implementations that vary in intrusiveness and informativeness. We analyze how the measures apply across a spectrum of centralized through decentralized deployment contexts, accounting for various actors in the supply chain including hardware and software service providers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our measures for privacy and concentration of power. Further work into understanding the measures and mitigating their negative impacts can help to build a foundation for the governance of AI agents.",

    "title": "Advancing AI Audits for Enhanced AI Governance",
    "published_date": "2023-11-26",
    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) is integrated into various services and systems in society, many companies and organizations have proposed AI principles, policies, and made the related commitments. Conversely, some have proposed the need for independent audits, arguing that the voluntary principles adopted by the developers and providers of AI services and systems insufficiently address risk. This policy recommendation summarizes the issues related to the auditing of AI services and systems and presents three recommendations for promoting AI auditing that contribute to sound AI governance. Recommendation1.Development of institutional design for AI audits. Recommendation2.Training human resources for AI audits. Recommendation3. Updating AI audits in accordance with technological progress. In this policy recommendation, AI is assumed to be that which recognizes and predicts data with the last chapter outlining how generative AI should be audited.",
    "summary": "This policy recommendation advocates for enhanced AI governance through independent audits, proposing the development of institutional frameworks, training programs for auditors, and mechanisms to adapt auditing practices to evolving AI technologies, including generative AI."

    "title": "Decentralized Governance of Autonomous AI Agents",
    "published_date": "2024-12-22",
    "abstract": "Autonomous AI agents present transformative opportunities and significant governance challenges. Existing frameworks, such as the EU AI Act and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, fall short of addressing the complexities of these agents, which are capable of independent decision-making, learning, and adaptation. To bridge these gaps, we propose the ETHOS (Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System) framework, a decentralized governance (DeGov) model leveraging Web3 technologies, including blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). ETHOS establishes a global registry for AI agents, enabling dynamic risk classification, proportional oversight, and automated compliance monitoring through tools like soulbound tokens and zero-knowledge proofs. Furthermore, the framework incorporates decentralized justice systems for transparent dispute resolution and introduces AI specific legal entities to manage limited liability, supported by mandatory insurance to ensure financial accountability and incentivize ethical design. By integrating philosophical principles of rationality, ethical grounding, and goal alignment, ETHOS aims to create a robust research agenda for promoting trust, transparency, and participatory governance. This innovative framework offers a scalable and inclusive strategy for regulating AI agents, balancing innovation with ethical responsibility to meet the demands of an AI-driven future.",
    "summary": "The paper proposes ETHOS, a decentralized governance framework using Web3 technologies to address the governance challenges of autonomous AI agents, focusing on a global registry, dynamic risk assessment, automated compliance, and decentralized dispute resolution mechanisms. This framework aims to balance AI innovation with ethical responsibility through transparency and participatory governance."

    "title": "Delegating Responsibilities to Intelligent Autonomous Systems: Challenges and Benefits",
    "published_date": "2024-11-06",
    "abstract": "As AI systems increasingly operate with autonomy and adaptability, the traditional boundaries of moral responsibility in techno-social systems are being challenged. This paper explores the evolving discourse on the delegation of responsibilities to intelligent autonomous agents and the ethical implications of such practices. Synthesizing recent developments in AI ethics, including concepts of distributed responsibility and ethical AI by design, the paper proposes a functionalist perspective as a framework. This perspective views moral responsibility not as an individual trait but as a role within a socio-technical system, distributed among human and artificial agents. As an example of 'AI ethical by design,' we present Basti and Vitiello's implementation. They suggest that AI can act as artificial moral agents by learning ethical guidelines and using Deontic Higher-Order Logic to assess decisions ethically. Motivated by the possible speed and scale beyond human supervision and ethical implications, the paper argues for 'AI ethical by design', while acknowledging the distributed, shared, and dynamic nature of responsibility. This functionalist approach offers a practical framework for navigating the complexities of AI ethics in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.",
    "summary": "This paper examines the ethical implications of delegating responsibility to intelligent autonomous systems, arguing for a functionalist perspective that distributes responsibility across human and artificial agents within a socio-technical system. It advocates for \"AI ethical by design,\" using Basti and Vitiello's work as an example, to address the challenges of AI autonomy and accountability."

    "title": "International Institutions for Advanced AI",
    "published_date": "2023-07-10",
    "abstract": "International institutions may have an important role to play in ensuring advanced AI systems benefit humanity. International collaborations can unlock AI's ability to further sustainable development, and coordination of regulatory efforts can reduce obstacles to innovation and the spread of benefits. Conversely, the potential dangerous capabilities of powerful and general-purpose AI systems create global externalities in their development and deployment, and international efforts to further responsible AI practices could help manage the risks they pose. This paper identifies a set of governance functions that could be performed at an international level to address these challenges, ranging from supporting access to frontier AI systems to setting international safety standards. It groups these functions into four institutional models that exhibit internal synergies and have precedents in existing organizations: 1) a Commission on Frontier AI that facilitates expert consensus on opportunities and risks from advanced AI, 2) an Advanced AI Governance Organization that sets international standards to manage global threats from advanced models, supports their implementation, and possibly monitors compliance with a future governance regime, 3) a Frontier AI Collaborative that promotes access to cutting-edge AI, and 4) an AI Safety Project that brings together leading researchers and engineers to further AI safety research. We explore the utility of these models and identify open questions about their viability.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes four international institutional models—a commission, a governance organization, a collaborative, and a research project—to address the opportunities and risks of advanced AI, focusing on facilitating international cooperation, setting safety standards, and promoting responsible development.
