    "title": "Dual Process Theory (System 1 & System 2) - LessWrong",
    "published_date": "2019-11-12",
    "summary": "Dual Process Theory describes two types of cognitive processes: Type 1 (fast, intuitive) and Type 2 (slow, deliberative), with the original \"System 1/System 2\" terminology now considered misleading due to the heterogeneity of processes within each type. Neither type is inherently more biased than the other; Type 2's perceived unbiasedness stems from its ability to correct Type 1 errors when appropriate rules exist."

    "published_date": "2018-09-04",
    "summary": "Analysis of Nobel laureates in physics reveals a statistically significant, though smaller than previously observed, overrepresentation of firstborns compared to chance (10 percentage points). This finding, based on data from autobiographies and genealogical websites, adds to existing evidence suggesting a birth order effect in STEM fields, despite limitations in data availability."

    "published_date": "2018-09-27",
    "summary": "A study using a public goods game with and without punishment mechanisms examined cooperation levels across diverse university student populations. The results, while incomplete in the provided text, suggest that the presence or absence of punishment significantly impacts cooperation rates."

    "published_date": "2016-12-25",
    "summary": "Multiple surveys of Wikipedia usage revealed a heavily skewed user base, with \"elite\" users exhibiting qualitatively different engagement than the general US population. This finding led to upward revisions of impact per pageview, but downward revisions of Wikipedia's overall reach and appeal."

    "title": "Bayesian Reasoning - Explained Like You're Five",
    "published_date": "2015-07-24",
    "summary": "This article explains Bayesian reasoning using coin-flip and homework scenarios. It demonstrates how to update the probability of a hypothesis (e.g., a coin being fair, a student doing homework) based on new evidence, illustrating the core principle of Bayesian inference."

    "title": "Effects of Castration on the Life Expectancy of Contemporary Men",
    "published_date": "2015-08-08",
    "summary": "This article analyzes studies on the effects of castration on male lifespan, finding that pre-pubertal castration significantly extends life expectancy (up to 14-19 years historically), while post-pubertal castration offers less benefit. The impact of castration on modern life expectancy is estimated to be lower due to improved infection control compared to historical periods."

    "title": "How to write an academic paper, according to me",
    "published_date": "2014-10-15",
    "summary": "The author argues that academic papers should be structured like an inverted pyramid, catering to multiple reader types with varying levels of engagement. This involves prioritizing clear communication of key findings in the abstract and early sections, while providing progressively more detail for deeper engagement."

    "title": "Bayesian Utility: Representing Preference by Probability Measures",
    "published_date": "2009-07-27",
    "summary": "Expected utility can be reformulated as the ratio of two probability measures, \"probability\" (P) and \"shouldness\" (Q), offering a conceptually symmetrical representation where Bayesian updating applies equally to both. This framework highlights the intertwined nature of probability and utility in preference, demonstrating that prior probabilities are integral to expressing preferences."
