### Mini Description

Design and organization of specialized departments or teams focused on specific aspects of AI governance, such as technical assessment, policy development, and stakeholder relations.

### Description

Functional units within AI governance institutions represent specialized departments or teams focused on distinct aspects of oversight and management. These units must be designed to effectively handle their specific domains while maintaining sufficient integration with other institutional components. The design of these units requires careful consideration of expertise requirements, operational scope, and interfaces with other departments.

A key challenge is determining the optimal division of responsibilities between units while ensuring comprehensive coverage of all necessary functions. This includes balancing the need for specialized technical units that can assess AI capabilities and safety measures with policy units that can translate technical insights into actionable governance frameworks. Additionally, units must be designed with clear mandates while maintaining enough flexibility to adapt to rapid technological changes and emerging challenges.

Current research explores various models for structuring these functional units, from traditional departmental divisions to more dynamic matrix organizations that enable cross-functional collaboration. Particular attention is paid to designing units that can effectively bridge the gap between technical and policy domains, maintain institutional memory, and provide rapid response capabilities when needed. Open questions include how to optimize information sharing between units, manage potential conflicts between unit objectives, and ensure comprehensive coverage of governance responsibilities without creating unnecessary bureaucratic overhead.
