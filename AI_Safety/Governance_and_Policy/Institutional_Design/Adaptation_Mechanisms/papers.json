    "title": "Adaptive Mechanism Design using Multi-Agent Revealed Preferences",
    "published_date": "2024-04-23",
    "abstract": "This paper constructs an algorithmic framework for adaptively achieving the mechanism design objective, finding a mechanism inducing socially optimal Nash equilibria, without knowledge of the utility functions of the agents. We consider a probing scheme where the designer can iteratively enact mechanisms and observe Nash equilibria responses. We first derive necessary and sufficient conditions, taking the form of linear program feasibility, for the existence of utility functions under which the empirical Nash equilibria responses are socially optimal. Then, we utilize this to construct a loss function with respect to the mechanism, and show that its global minimization occurs at mechanisms under which Nash equilibria system responses are also socially optimal. We develop a simulated annealing-based gradient algorithm, and prove that it converges in probability to this set of global minima, thus achieving adaptive mechanism design.",

    "summary": "This paper presents an algorithm for adaptive mechanism design that iteratively probes agents' Nash equilibrium responses to mechanisms, using these observations to identify mechanisms inducing socially optimal equilibria without requiring knowledge of agent utility functions. The algorithm uses a simulated annealing approach to minimize a loss function, converging probabilistically to mechanisms achieving the socially optimal outcome."

    "published_date": "2022-02-12",
    "abstract": "We develop a tractable model for studying strategic interactions between learning algorithms. We uncover a mechanism responsible for the emergence of algorithmic collusion. We observe that algorithms periodically coordinate on actions that are more profitable than static Nash equilibria. This novel collusive channel relies on an endogenous statistical linkage in the algorithms' estimates which we call spontaneous coupling. The model's parameters predict whether the statistical linkage will appear, and what market structures facilitate algorithmic collusion. We show that spontaneous coupling can sustain collusion in prices and market shares, complementing experimental findings in the literature. Finally, we apply our results to design algorithmic markets.",

    "title": "Automated Dynamic Mechanism Design",
    "published_date": "2021-05-13",
    "abstract": "We study Bayesian automated mechanism design in unstructured dynamic environments, where a principal repeatedly interacts with an agent, and takes actions based on the strategic agent's report of the current state of the world. Both the principal and the agent can have arbitrary and potentially different valuations for the actions taken, possibly also depending on the actual state of the world. Moreover, at any time, the state of the world may evolve arbitrarily depending on the action taken by the principal. The goal is to compute an optimal mechanism which maximizes the principal's utility in the face of the self-interested strategic agent. We give an efficient algorithm for computing optimal mechanisms, with or without payments, under different individual-rationality constraints, when the time horizon is constant. Our algorithm is based on a sophisticated linear program formulation, which can be customized in various ways to accommodate richer constraints. For environments with large time horizons, we show that the principal's optimal utility is hard to approximate within a certain constant factor, complementing our algorithmic result. We further consider a special case of the problem where the agent is myopic, and give a refined efficient algorithm whose time complexity scales linearly in the time horizon. Moreover, we show that memoryless mechanisms do not provide a good solution for our problem, in terms of both optimality and computational tractability. These results paint a relatively complete picture for automated dynamic mechanism design in unstructured environments. Finally, we present experimental results where our algorithms are applied to synthetic dynamic environments with different characteristics, which not only serve as a proof of concept for our algorithms, but also exhibit intriguing phenomena in dynamic mechanism design.",

    "summary": "This paper presents efficient algorithms for computing optimal Bayesian mechanisms in dynamic environments with a fixed time horizon, solving for a principal's maximized utility despite a strategic agent's actions and evolving states. The authors also demonstrate the computational hardness of approximating optimal utility for large time horizons and analyze the limitations of memoryless mechanisms."

    "title": "Institutional Variety and Ayres-Veblen “Lag”: Implications for Selection and Development",
    "abstract": "Abstract Firms and nations attempt to build their technological capabilities amidst co-existing systems of knowledge and a variety of institutions. This variety might in principle result in fragmented knowledge and learning systems with no easy adaptation, clear social connection, or shared idea of progress. High institutional variety environments may be innovative but offer an uncertain future environment in which individuals and firms act, and which can paralyze the search and learning process. This paper discusses the Ayres-Veblenian concept of institutional 'lag' and its links to institutional variety. Industrial policy is routinely used conceptually and administratively as a selection device to cull such institutional variety, for example, re-steering the health industry's knowledge and production context or integrating informality in social policy design. Policy selection can thus offer valuable framing contexts to build inference and judgments about evolutionary systems and technology products. Once an evolutionary and institutional perspective is employed however, 'lag' and 'progress' are technologically contingent. The paper concludes that both industrial analysis and economics' philosophical foundations may benefit from co-evolutionary and combinatorial approaches, and insights from a non-Western perspective.",

    "published_date": "2021-09-16",
    "abstract": "Social change in any society entails changes in both behaviours and institutions. We model a group-structured society in which the transmission of individual behaviour occurs in parallel with the selection of group-level institutions. We consider a cooperative behaviour that generates collective benefits for groups but does not spread between individuals on its own. Groups exhibit institutions that increase the diffusion of the behaviour within the group, but also incur a group cost. Groups adopt institutions in proportion to their fitness. Finally, the behaviour may also spread globally. We find that behaviour and institutions can be mutually reinforcing. But the model also generates behavioural source-sink dynamics when behaviour generated in institutionalized groups spreads to non-institutionalized groups and boosts their fitness. Consequently, the global diffusion of group-beneficial behaviour creates a pattern of institutional free-riding that limits the evolution of group-beneficial institutions. Our model suggests that, in a group-structured society, large-scale beneficial social change can be best achieved when the relevant behaviour and institutions remain correlated.",

    "summary": "A model of group-structured societies reveals that while cooperation-boosting institutions and behaviors can be mutually reinforcing, the spread of cooperative behavior from institutionalized to non-institutionalized groups leads to institutional free-riding, hindering the widespread adoption of beneficial institutions."

    "published_date": "2021-09-29",
    "abstract": "We consider a queue with an unobservable backlog by the incoming users. There is an information designer that observes the queue backlog and makes recommendations to the users arriving at the queue whether to join or not to join the queue. The arriving users have payoff relevant private types. The users, upon arrival, send a message, that is supposed to be their type, to the information designer if they are willing to hear a recommendation. The information designer then creates a recommendation for that specific type of user. The users have to pay a tax in exchange for the information they receive. In this setting, the information designer has two types of commitments. The first commitment is the recommendation policy and the second commitment is the tax function. We combine mechanism design and information design to study a queuing system with heterogeneous users. In this setting, the information designer is a sender of the information in the information design aspect and a receiver in the mechanism design aspect of the model. We formulate an optimization problem that characterizes the solution of the joint design problem. We characterize the tax functions and provide structural results for the recommendation policy of the information designer.",

    "published_date": "2021-05-10",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a model of a stylized organization that is comprised of several departments that autonomously allocate tasks. To do so, the departments either take short-sighted decisions that immediately maximize their utility or take long-sighted decisions that aim at minimizing the interdependencies between tasks. The organization guides the departments' behavior by either an individualistic, a balanced, or an altruistic linear incentive scheme. Even if tasks are perfectly decomposable, altruistic incentive schemes are preferred over individualistic incentive schemes since they substantially increase the organization's performance. Interestingly, if altruistic incentive schemes are effective, short-sighted decisions appear favorable since they do not only increase performance in the short run but also result in significantly higher performances in the long run.",
    "citation_count": 4,
    "summary": "A model of organizational design shows that altruistic incentive schemes outperform individualistic ones, even with perfectly decomposable tasks, significantly increasing overall organizational performance. Paradoxically, short-sighted departmental decisions become advantageous under effective altruistic incentives, boosting both short-term and long-term performance."

    "published_date": "2020-01-23",
    "abstract": "Political systems shape institutions and govern institutional change supporting economic performance, production and diffusion of technological innovation. This study shows, using global data of countries, that institutional change, based on a progressive democratization of countries, is a driving force of inventions, adoption and diffusion of innovations in society. The relation between technological innovation and level of democracy can be explained with following factors: higher economic freedom in society, effective regulation, higher economic and political stability, higher investments in R&D and higher education, good economic governance and higher level of education system for training high-skilled human resources. Overall, then, the positive associations between institutional change, based on a process of democratization, and paths of technological innovation can sustain best practices of political economy for the development of economies in the presence of globalization and geographical expansion of markets.",

    "title": "Catastrophe by Design in Population Games: Destabilizing Wasteful Locked-in Technologies",
    "published_date": "2020-07-25",
    "abstract": "In multi-agent environments in which coordination is desirable, the history of play often causes lock-in at sub-optimal outcomes. Notoriously, technologies with a significant environmental footprint or high social cost persist despite the successful development of more environmentally friendly and/or socially efficient alternatives. The displacement of the status quo is hindered by entrenched economic interests and network effects. To exacerbate matters, the standard mechanism design approaches based on centralized authorities with the capacity to use preferential subsidies to effectively dictate system outcomes are not always applicable to modern decentralized economies. What other types of mechanisms are feasible? In this paper, we develop and analyze a mechanism that induces transitions from inefficient lock-ins to superior alternatives. This mechanism does not exogenously favor one option over another -- instead, the phase transition emerges endogenously via a standard evolutionary learning model, Q-learning, where agents trade-off exploration and exploitation. Exerting the same transient influence to both the efficient and inefficient technologies encourages exploration and results in irreversible phase transitions and permanent stabilization of the efficient one. On a technical level, our work is based on bifurcation and catastrophe theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with changes in the number and stability properties of equilibria. Critically, our analysis is shown to be structurally robust to significant and even adversarially chosen perturbations to the parameters of both our game and our behavioral model.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a decentralized mechanism, using Q-learning, that facilitates the transition from inefficiently locked-in technologies to superior alternatives in multi-agent systems, achieving this through endogenous phase transitions driven by balanced exploration and exploitation rather than exogenous intervention. The mechanism's robustness to parameter perturbations is demonstrated using bifurcation and catastrophe theory."
