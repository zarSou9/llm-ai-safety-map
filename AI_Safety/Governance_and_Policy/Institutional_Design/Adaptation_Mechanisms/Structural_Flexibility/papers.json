    "title": "Building resilient organizations: The roles of top-down vs. bottom-up organizing",
    "published_date": "2023-05-12",
    "abstract": "Organizations face numerous challenges posed by unexpected events such as energy price hikes, pandemic disruptions, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters, and the factors that contribute to organizational success in dealing with such disruptions often remain unclear. This paper analyzes the roles of top-down and bottom-up organizational structures in promoting organizational resilience. To do so, an agent-based model of stylized organizations is introduced that features learning, adaptation, different modes of organizing, and environmental disruptions. The results indicate that bottom-up designed organizations tend to have a higher ability to absorb the effects of environmental disruptions, and situations are identified in which either top-down or bottom-up designed organizations have an advantage in recovering from shocks.",

    "summary": "This paper uses agent-based modeling to compare the resilience of top-down and bottom-up organizational structures against environmental shocks, finding that bottom-up organizations exhibit greater shock absorption, while the recovery advantage depends on specific circumstances."

    "title": "Corporate Culture and Organizational Fragility",
    "published_date": "2023-01-21",
    "abstract": "For a large organization to successfully complete a complex project, many constituent tasks must all be successfully completed. A typical such task can be completed only if several other, tailored input tasks are completed. Thus a complex project, such as designing a new product and bringing it to market, requires many collaborations among workers to succeed, both within and across business units. Some collaborations succeed, while others fail. Corporate culture---a broad notion that entails many aspects of the working environment---supports collaborations by establishing norms and reducing miscommunications or misunderstandings. However, the strength of a corporate culture is endogneous. Individual actions of workers that run counter to it undermine it and adhering to the corporate culture in a given situation can be costly to a worker. Because a strong corporate culture relies on costly, voluntary investments by many workers, we model it as an organizational public good, subject to standard free-riding problems, which become severe in large organizations. Indeed, a standard analysis would suggest that workers' incentives to make voluntary contributions to the corporate culture vanish as an organization becomes large, because their marginal impact becomes negligible while their marginal cost does not. This raises an important question: Why do workers exert voluntary effort to enhance the corporate cultures of large organizations? We propose a perspective on this question based on a network model of complex production within a large organization: The productive activity of the organization occurs via the completion of tasks, where a given worker in charge of a task relies on the completion of several types of essential subtasks, which are incorporated into the task via collaborations with other workers. We find that voluntary contributions to culture can be sustained, because an organization's equilibrium productivity is endogenously highly sensitive to individual contributions. This implies a new mechanism generating incentives for voluntary, decentralized investment in culture even as an organization becomes large and the free-rider problem becomes severe: the marginal impact of contributions becomes large enough to compensate. However, the completion of complex tasks is then necessarily fragile to small shocks that can disrupt the organization's culture, such as a merger or a change in the company's top management.",
    "summary": "This paper models corporate culture as an organizational public good, vulnerable to free-riding, yet sustained in large organizations due to the high sensitivity of productivity to individual cultural contributions. However, this same sensitivity makes complex projects fragile to disruptions affecting corporate culture."

    "title": "Strategic Alignment Between IT Flexibility and Dynamic Capabilities: An Empirical Investigation",
    "published_date": "2021-05-18",
    "abstract": "Dynamic capabilities theory (DCT) emerged as a leading framework in the process of value creation for firms. Its core notion complements the premise of the resource-based view of the firm and is considered an important theoretical and management framework in modern information systems research. However, despite DCT's significant contributions, its strength and core focus are essentially in its use for historical firm performance explanation. Furthermore, valuable contributions have been made by several researchers to extend the DCT to fit the constantly changing IT environments and other imperative drivers for competitive performance. However, no DCT extension has been developed which allows firms to integrally assess their current state of maturity to derive imperative steps for further performance enhancements. In light of empirical advancement, this article aims to develop a strategic alignment model for IT flexibility and dynamic capabilities and empirically validates proposed hypotheses using correlation and regression analyses on a large data sample of 322 international firms. The authors conjecture that the combined synergetic effect of the underlying dimensions of a firm's IT flexibility architecture and dynamic capabilities enables organizations to cope with changing environmental conditions and drive competitive firm performance. Findings of this study suggest that there is a significant positive relationship between firms' degree of strategic alignment—defined as the degree of balance between all dimensions—and competitive firm performance. Strategic alignment can, therefore, be seen as an important condition that significantly influences a firm's competitive advantage in constantly changing environments. The proposed framework helps firms assess and improve their maturity and alignment of IT flexibility and dynamic capabilities. This article concludes with a discussion, suggestions for future research and managerial implications are also discussed.",

    "summary": "This study empirically investigates the relationship between IT flexibility, dynamic capabilities, and firm performance, finding a significant positive correlation between strategic alignment of these factors and competitive advantage. A proposed model helps firms assess and improve their maturity in this alignment."

    "title": "Towards Better Adaptive Systems by Combining MAPE, Control Theory, and Machine Learning",
    "published_date": "2021-03-19",
    "abstract": "Two established approaches to engineer adaptive systems are architecture-based adaptation that uses a Monitor-Analysis-Planning-Executing (MAPE) loop that reasons over architectural models (aka Knowledge) to make adaptation decisions, and control-based adaptation that relies on principles of control theory (CT) to realize adaptation. Recently, we also observe a rapidly growing interest in applying machine learning (ML) to support different adaptation mechanisms. While MAPE and CT have particular characteristics and strengths to be applied independently, in this paper, we are concerned with the question of how these approaches are related with one another and whether combining them and supporting them with ML can produce better adaptive systems. We motivate the combined use of different adaptation approaches using a scenario of a cloud-based enterprise system and illustrate the analysis when combining the different approaches. To conclude, we offer a set of open questions for further research in this interesting area.",
    "citation_count": 20,
    "summary": "This paper explores the synergy between Model-Analysis-Planning-Execute (MAPE) loops, control theory, and machine learning in building adaptive systems, arguing that combining these approaches can yield superior results compared to using them independently. The authors illustrate this potential through a cloud-based enterprise system scenario and propose avenues for future research."

    "published_date": "2021-01-02",
    "abstract": "Flexibility design problems are a class of problems that appear in strategic decision-making across industries, where the objective is to design a ($e.g.$, manufacturing) network that affords flexibility and adaptivity. The underlying combinatorial nature and stochastic objectives make flexibility design problems challenging for standard optimization methods. In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for flexibility design problems. Specifically, we carefully design mechanisms with noisy exploration and variance reduction to ensure empirical success and show the unique advantage of RL in terms of fast-adaptation. Empirical results show that the RL-based method consistently finds better solutions compared to classical heuristics.",

    "title": "Adaptability and the Pivot Penalty in Science and Technology",
    "published_date": "2021-07-14",
    "abstract": "Scientists and inventors set the direction of their work amidst an evolving landscape of questions, opportunities, and challenges. This paper introduces a measurement framework to quantify how far researchers move from their existing research when producing new works. We apply this framework to millions of scientific publications and patents and uncover a pervasive\"pivot penalty\", where the impact of new research steeply declines the further a researcher moves from their prior work. The pivot penalty applies nearly universally across scientific publishing and patenting and has been growing in magnitude over the past five decades. While creativity frameworks suggest a benefit to exploratory search by researchers and often emphasize outsider advantages in driving breakthroughs, we find little evidence for such an advantage. The pivot penalty is consistent with increasingly narrow specializations of researchers, and when researchers undertake large pivots, a signature of their work is weak engagement with established mixtures of prior knowledge. Unexpected shocks to the research landscape, which may push researchers away from existing areas or pull them into new ones, further demonstrate substantial pivot penalties. COVID-19 provides a high-scale case study, where many researchers engaged the pandemic, yet the pivot penalty remains severe. The pivot penalty generalizes across fields, career stage, productivity, collaboration, and funding contexts, highlighting both the breadth and depth of the adaptive challenge. Overall, the findings point to large and increasing challenges in adapting to new opportunities and threats. The results have implications for individual researchers, research organizations, science policy, and the capacity of science and society as a whole to confront emergent demands.",
    "summary": "This paper introduces a \"pivot penalty\" metric quantifying the decreased impact of research when deviating significantly from prior work, revealing a pervasive and growing trend across science and technology despite theoretical benefits of exploratory research. The findings suggest substantial adaptive challenges for researchers and institutions facing new opportunities and threats."
