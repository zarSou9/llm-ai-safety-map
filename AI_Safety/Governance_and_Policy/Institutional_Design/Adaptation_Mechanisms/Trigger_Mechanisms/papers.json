    "title": "A Pin and a Balloon: Anthropic Fragility Increases Chances of Runaway Global Warming",
    "published_date": "2022-09-11",
    "summary": "Due to survival bias, humanity underestimates the likelihood and proximity of climate tipping points, making Earth more vulnerable to even small human actions; this increases the probability of human extinction via runaway global warming."

    "published_date": "2021-04-06",
    "summary": "A standard epidemiological model struggles to explain the surprisingly similar COVID-19 infection rates across US states despite varying policies and behaviors. A proposed \"vulnerability model,\" incorporating fluctuating individual susceptibility to infection over time, better accounts for the observed data and avoids the inconsistencies of the standard model."

    "published_date": "2020-04-14",
    "summary": "The article proposes widespread use of high-quality reusable particle filtering masks as a cost-effective, long-term strategy to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, allowing for the lifting of other restrictive measures while maintaining exponential decay of new cases. This approach aims to avoid the economic devastation and high mortality associated with alternative pandemic control strategies."

    "title": "Introduction to the special issue on adapting institutions to climate change",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article introduces the special issue on climate adaptation and institutions. Economic accounts of climate adaptation have stressed its collective action nature and the limitations of standard economic approaches to the matter. Governance accounts, on their part, have shown that adaptation does not always happen when it is expected. Against this background, institutional economics has the potential to shed light on those societal processes and collective mechanisms leading to and shaping adaptation (or the absence of it). The selection of articles contributing to this special issue shows that climate adaptation can indeed be explored successfully through institutional economics, and that doing so fits well within the institutional economics agenda. Some recommendations for future research are provided at the end.",

    "summary": "This special issue explores climate change adaptation through the lens of institutional economics, highlighting the importance of collective action and governance in successful adaptation strategies. The articles demonstrate the valuable contribution of institutional economics to understanding why adaptation occurs (or fails to occur) and suggest avenues for future research."

    "title": "The Vulnerable World Hypothesis (by Bostrom)",
    "published_date": "2018-11-06",
    "summary": "Nick Bostrom's \"The Vulnerable World Hypothesis\" posits that continued technological advancement significantly increases the likelihood of civilizational collapse unless global governance effectively mitigates risks stemming from easily accessible destructive technologies and misaligned incentives among actors. The paper categorizes these vulnerabilities and explores potential solutions, concluding that enhanced surveillance, preventive policing, and robust global governance are crucial to avoid catastrophic outcomes."

    "title": "Developing a reusable control-based approach to build self-adaptive software systems with formal guarantees",
    "abstract": "An increasingly important concern of software engineers is handling uncertainty at runtime. Over the last decade researchers have applied architecture-based self-adaptation approaches to address this concern. However, providing guarantees required by current software systems has shown to be challenging with these approaches. To tackle this challenge, we study the application of control theory to realize self-adaptation and develop novel control-based adaptation mechanisms that guarantee desired system properties. Results are validated on systems with strict requirements.",

    "published_date": "2016-09-25",
    "summary": "While asteroid impacts pose a negligible risk in the next century, supervolcano eruptions represent a more significant natural threat. However, the greatest risk may be an inaccurate estimation of natural risks due to factors like survival bias and the possibility that humanity currently inhabits a uniquely fragile and unstable environment."
