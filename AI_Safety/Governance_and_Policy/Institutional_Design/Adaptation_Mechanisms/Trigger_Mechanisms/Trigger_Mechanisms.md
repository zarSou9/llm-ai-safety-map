### Mini Description

Systems for identifying when institutional adaptation is necessary, including metrics, thresholds, and evaluation criteria that prompt review or modification of existing processes.

### Description

Trigger mechanisms in AI governance institutions are systems and processes designed to identify when adaptation or intervention is needed in response to developments in AI capabilities, safety concerns, or governance effectiveness. These mechanisms must balance sensitivity to genuine signals requiring action against robustness to false alarms, while maintaining transparency and legitimacy in their operation.

A key challenge is determining appropriate thresholds and indicators that can reliably detect significant developments or emerging risks. This involves both technical metrics (like performance benchmarks or safety violations) and social indicators (such as shifts in public opinion or expert consensus). Research focuses on developing composite indicators that can capture complex developments while remaining interpretable and actionable, including methods for aggregating diverse sources of information and expertise.

Current work explores both quantitative and qualitative approaches to trigger design, from formal mathematical models of risk thresholds to structured expert elicitation processes. Particular attention is paid to mechanisms that can operate effectively under uncertainty and incomplete information, while remaining resistant to gaming or manipulation. This includes research into early warning systems, prediction markets, and other novel approaches to identifying significant developments that warrant institutional response.
