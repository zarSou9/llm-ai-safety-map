    "title": "Emergency Response Inference Mapping (ERIMap): A Bayesian Network-based Method for Dynamic Observation Processing in Spatially Distributed Emergencies",
    "published_date": "2024-03-11",
    "abstract": "In emergencies, high stake decisions often have to be made under time pressure and strain. In order to support such decisions, information from various sources needs to be collected and processed rapidly. The information available tends to be temporally and spatially variable, uncertain, and sometimes conflicting, leading to potential biases in decisions. Currently, there is a lack of systematic approaches for information processing and situation assessment which meet the particular demands of emergency situations. To address this gap, we present a Bayesian network-based method called ERIMap that is tailored to the complex information-scape during emergencies. The method enables the systematic and rapid processing of heterogeneous and potentially uncertain observations and draws inferences about key variables of an emergency. It thereby reduces complexity and cognitive load for decision makers. The output of the ERIMap method is a dynamically evolving and spatially resolved map of beliefs about key variables of an emergency that is updated each time a new observation becomes available. The method is illustrated in a case study in which an emergency response is triggered by an accident causing a gas leakage on a chemical plant site.",

    "title": "An Emergency Disposal Decision-making Method with Human-Machine Collaboration",
    "published_date": "2023-05-29",
    "abstract": "Rapid developments in artificial intelligence technology have led to unmanned systems replacing human beings in many fields requiring high-precision predictions and decisions. In modern operational environments, all job plans are affected by emergency events such as equipment failures and resource shortages, making a quick resolution critical. The use of unmanned systems to assist decision-making can improve resolution efficiency, but their decision-making is not interpretable and may make the wrong decisions. Current unmanned systems require human supervision and control. Based on this, we propose a collaborative human--machine method for resolving unplanned events using two phases: task filtering and task scheduling. In the task filtering phase, we propose a human--machine collaborative decision-making algorithm for dynamic tasks. The GACRNN model is used to predict the state of the job nodes, locate the key nodes, and generate a machine-predicted resolution task list. A human decision-maker supervises the list in real time and modifies and confirms the machine-predicted list through the human--machine interface. In the task scheduling phase, we propose a scheduling algorithm that integrates human experience constraints. The steps to resolve an event are inserted into the normal job sequence to schedule the resolution. We propose several human--machine collaboration methods in each phase to generate steps to resolve an unplanned event while minimizing the impact on the original job plan.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a two-phase human-machine collaborative method for emergency disposal decision-making, using a GACRNN model for initial task prediction and a human-in-the-loop system for refinement and scheduling to minimize disruption to existing plans. The method incorporates both machine prediction and human expertise to improve efficiency and reliability in emergency response."

    "title": "Prioritizing emergency evacuations under compounding levels of uncertainty",
    "published_date": "2022-09-08",
    "abstract": "Well-executed emergency evacuations can save lives and reduce suffering. However, decision makers struggle to determine optimal evacuation policies given the chaos, uncertainty, and value judgments inherent in emergency evacuations. We propose and analyze a decision support tool for pre-crisis training exercises for teams preparing for civilian evacuations and explore the tool in the case of the 2021 U.S.-led evacuation from Afghanistan. We use different classes of Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture compounding levels of uncertainty in (1) the priority category of who appears next at the gate for evacuation, (2) the distribution of priority categories at the population level, and (3) individuals' claimed priority category. We compare the number of people evacuated by priority status under eight heuristic policies. The optimized MDP policy achieves the best performance compared to all heuristic baselines. We also show that accounting for the compounding levels of model uncertainty incurs added complexity without improvement in policy performance. Useful heuristics can be extracted from the optimized policies to inform human decision makers. We opensource all tools to encourage robust dialogue about the trade-offs, limitations, and potential of integrating algorithms into high-stakes humanitarian decision-making.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "This paper develops and analyzes a Markov decision process (MDP)-based decision support tool for prioritizing emergency evacuations, considering uncertainties in arrival order, population demographics, and self-reported priority. The optimized MDP policy outperforms heuristic approaches, though accounting for all uncertainties doesn't significantly improve performance, suggesting simpler heuristics can be effectively used."

    "title": "Decision-making of Emergent Incident based on P-MADDPG",
    "published_date": "2022-03-19",
    "abstract": "In recent years, human casualties and damage to resources caused by emergent incidents have become a serious problem worldwide. In this paper, we model the emergency decision-making problem and use Multi-agent System (MAS) to solve the problem that the decision speed cannot keep up with the spreading speed. MAS can play an important role in the automated execution of these tasks to reduce mission completion time. In this paper, we propose a P-MADDPG algorithm to solve the emergency decision-making problem of emergent incidents, which predicts the nodes where an incident may occur in the next time by GRU model and makes decisions before the incident occurs, thus solving the problem that the decision speed cannot keep up with the spreading speed. A simulation environment was established for realistic scenarios, and three scenarios were selected to test the performance of P-MADDPG in emergency decision-making problems for emergent incidents: unmanned storage, factory assembly line, and civil airport baggage transportation. Simulation results using the P-MADDPG algorithm are compared with the greedy algorithm and the MADDPG algorithm, and the final experimental results show that the P-MADDPG algorithm converges faster and better than the other algorithms in scenarios of different sizes. This shows that the P-MADDP algorithm is effective for emergency decision-making in emergent incident.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes P-MADDPG, a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that predicts emergent incidents and makes proactive decisions to improve response time, outperforming MADDPG and greedy algorithms in simulated scenarios involving unmanned storage, factory assembly lines, and airport baggage transport. The algorithm uses a GRU model for incident prediction."

    "published_date": "2022-02-23",
    "abstract": "Designing effective emergency response management (ERM) systems to respond to incidents such as road accidents is a major problem faced by communities. In addition to responding to frequent incidents each day (about 240 million emergency medical services calls and over 5 million road accidents in the US each year), these systems also support response during natural hazards. Recently, there has been a consistent interest in building decision support and optimization tools that can help emergency responders provide more efficient and effective response. This includes a number of principled subsystems that implement early incident detection, incident likelihood forecasting and strategic resource allocation and dispatch policies. In this paper, we highlight the key challenges and provide an overview of the approach developed by our team in collaboration with our community partners.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Planning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Smart and Connected Communities",
    "published_date": "2021-07-02",
    "abstract": "Resource allocation under uncertainty is a classic problem in city-scale cyber-physical systems. Consider emergency response, where urban planners and first responders optimize the location of ambulances to minimize expected response times to incidents such as road accidents. Typically, such problems involve sequential decision making under uncertainty and can be modeled as Markov (or semi-Markov) decision processes. The goal of the decision maker is to learn a mapping from states to actions that can maximize expected rewards. While online, offline, and decentralized approaches have been proposed to tackle such problems, scalability remains a challenge for real world use cases. We present a general approach to hierarchical planning that leverages structure in city level CPS problems for resource allocation. We use emergency response as a case study and show how a large resource allocation problem can be split into smaller problems. We then use Monte Carlo planning for solving the smaller problems and managing the interaction between them. Finally, we use data from Nashville, Tennessee, a major metropolitan area in the United States, to validate our approach. Our experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches used in the field of emergency response.",
