    "title": "Distributed Agreement in the Arrovian Framework",
    "published_date": "2024-09-07",
    "abstract": "Preference aggregation is a fundamental problem in voting theory, in which public input rankings of a set of alternatives (called preferences) must be aggregated into a single preference that satisfies certain soundness properties. The celebrated Arrow Impossibility Theorem is equivalent to a distributed task in a synchronous fault-free system that satisfies properties such as respecting unanimous preferences, maintaining independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), and non-dictatorship, along with consensus since only one preference can be decided. In this work, we study a weaker distributed task in which crash faults are introduced, IIA is not required, and the consensus property is relaxed to either $k$-set agreement or $\\epsilon$-approximate agreement using any metric on the set of preferences. In particular, we prove several novel impossibility results for both of these tasks in both synchronous and asynchronous distributed systems. We additionally show that the impossibility for our $\\epsilon$-approximate agreement task using the Kendall tau or Spearman footrule metrics holds under extremely weak assumptions.",
    "summary": "This paper investigates distributed preference aggregation, framing Arrow's Impossibility Theorem as a distributed consensus problem. It presents novel impossibility results for achieving $k$-set agreement or $\\epsilon$-approximate agreement on aggregated preferences in synchronous and asynchronous systems, even with relaxed constraints compared to Arrow's original theorem."

    "title": "Legitimacy of collective decisions: a mechanism design approach",
    "published_date": "2023-02-19",
    "abstract": "We design two mechanisms that ensure that the majority preferred option wins in all equilibria. The first one is a simultaneous game where agents choose other agents to cooperate with on top of the vote for an alternative, thus overcoming recent impossibility results concerning the implementation of majority rule. The second one adds sequential ratification to the standard majority voting procedure allowing to reach the (correct) outcome in significantly fewer steps than the widely used roll call voting. Both mechanisms use off-equilibrium lotteries to incentivize truthful voting. We discuss different extensions, including the possibility for agents to abstain.",
    "summary": "This paper presents two novel voting mechanisms—a simultaneous game with cooperative choices and a sequential ratification process—that guarantee the majority-preferred option wins in all equilibria, overcoming previous impossibility results. Both mechanisms employ off-equilibrium lotteries to incentivize truthful voting."

    "title": "Phragmén Rules for Degressive and Regressive Proportionality",
    "published_date": "2022-01-12",
    "abstract": "We study two concepts of proportionality in the model of approval-based committee elections. In degressive proportionality small minorities of voters are favored in comparison with the standard linear proportionality. Regressive proportionality, on the other hand, requires that larger subdivisions of voters are privileged. We introduce a new family of rules that broadly generalize Phragmén's Sequential Rule spanning the spectrum between degressive and regressive proportionality. We analyze and compare the two principles of proportionality assuming the voters and the candidates can be represented as points in an Euclidean issue space.",

The authors analyze these concepts, comparing them within a Euclidean issue space representation of voters and candidates."

    "title": "Robust Sparse Voting",
    "published_date": "2022-02-17",
    "abstract": "Many applications, such as content moderation and recommendation, require reviewing and scoring a large number of alternatives. Doing so robustly is however very challenging. Indeed, voters' inputs are inevitably sparse: most alternatives are only scored by a small fraction of voters. This sparsity amplifies the effects of biased voters introducing unfairness, and of malicious voters seeking to hack the voting process by reporting dishonest scores. We give a precise definition of the problem of robust sparse voting, highlight its underlying technical challenges, and present a novel voting mechanism addressing the problem. We prove that, using this mechanism, no voter can have more than a small parameterizable effect on each alternative's score; a property we call Lipschitz resilience. We also identify conditions of voters comparability under which any unanimous preferences can be recovered, even when each voter provides sparse scores, on a scale that is potentially very different from any other voter's score scale. Proving these properties required us to introduce, analyze and carefully compose novel aggregation primitives which could be of independent interest.",
    "citation_count": 6,
    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel voting mechanism for robustly aggregating sparse voter scores, proving its resilience to biased or malicious voters by guaranteeing a limited influence per voter (Lipschitz resilience) and the recovery of unanimous preferences under specific voter comparability conditions. The mechanism utilizes novel aggregation primitives to handle the challenges posed by sparse data."

    "title": "Wisdom of the Crowd Voting: Truthful Aggregation of Voter Information and Preferences",
    "published_date": "2021-08-08",
    "abstract": "We consider two-alternative elections where voters' preferences depend on a state variable that is not directly observable. Each voter receives a private signal that is correlated to the state variable. Voters may be\"contingent\"with different preferences in different states; or predetermined with the same preference in every state. In this setting, even if every voter is a contingent voter, agents voting according to their private information need not result in the adoption of the universally preferred alternative, because the signals can be systematically biased. We present an easy-to-deploy mechanism that elicits and aggregates the private signals from the voters, and outputs the alternative that is favored by the majority. In particular, voters truthfully reporting their signals forms a strong Bayes Nash equilibrium (where no coalition of voters can deviate and receive a better outcome).",
    "citation_count": 12,
    "summary": "This paper analyzes two-alternative elections where voters' preferences depend on an unobservable state variable, showing that even with truthful private signal reporting, majority voting may not select the universally preferred alternative due to signal bias. The authors propose a mechanism to elicit and aggregate these signals, resulting in a strong Bayes Nash equilibrium where truthful reporting is optimal."

    "title": "Joint aggregation of cardinal and ordinal evaluations with an application to a student paper competition",
    "published_date": "2021-01-12",
    "abstract": "An important problem in decision theory concerns the aggregation of individual rankings/ratings into a collective evaluation. We illustrate a new aggregation method in the context of the 2007 MSOM's student paper competition. The aggregation problem in this competition poses two challenges. Firstly, each paper was reviewed only by a very small fraction of the judges; thus the aggregate evaluation is highly sensitive to the subjective scales chosen by the judges. Secondly, the judges provided both cardinal and ordinal evaluations (ratings and rankings) of the papers they reviewed. The contribution here is a new robust methodology that jointly aggregates ordinal and cardinal evaluations into a collective evaluation. This methodology is particularly suitable in cases of incomplete evaluations—i.e., when the individuals evaluate only a strict subset of the objects. This approach is potentially useful in managerial decision making problems by a committee selecting projects from a large set or capital budgeting involving multiple priorities.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a novel robust methodology for aggregating both cardinal and ordinal evaluations, addressing the challenge of incomplete data sets where judges assess only a subset of items, as exemplified by a student paper competition. The method is particularly useful for situations with incomplete evaluations and diverse subjective scales."

    "title": "Diversity in Kemeny Rank Aggregation: A Parameterized Approach",
    "published_date": "2021-05-19",
    "abstract": "In its most traditional setting, the main concern of optimization theory is the search for optimal solutions for instances of a given computational problem. A recent trend of research in artificial intelligence, called solution diversity, has focused on the development of notions of optimality that may be more appropriate in settings where subjectivity is essential. The idea is that instead of aiming at the development of algorithms that output a single optimal solution, the goal is to investigate algorithms that output a small set of sufficiently good solutions that are sufficiently diverse from one another. In this way, the user has the opportunity to choose the solution that is most appropriate to the context at hand. It also displays the richness of the solution space.\n\n\n\nWhen combined with techniques from parameterized complexity theory, the paradigm of diversity of solutions offers a powerful algorithmic framework to address problems of practical relevance. In this work, we investigate the impact of this combination in the field of Kemeny Rank Aggregation, a well-studied class of problems lying in the intersection of order theory and social choice theory and also in the field of order theory itself. In particular, we show that KRA is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to natural parameters providing natural formalizations of the notions of diversity and of the notion of a sufficiently good solution. Our main results work both when considering the traditional setting of aggregation over linearly ordered votes, and in the more general setting where votes are partially ordered.",

    "summary": "This paper explores diverse solutions to the Kemeny Rank Aggregation problem, a challenge in social choice theory, using a parameterized complexity approach. The authors demonstrate that finding a diverse set of near-optimal rankings is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to parameters representing solution quality and diversity, for both linear and partial order votes."

    "abstract": "Our contribution concerns interactive decision support systems for group decision support. Through this study, we apply to implement a decisional process aiming to represent the multiplicity of actors, their diversity, their behaviors and their interactions. In this context, we contribute to the design and development of a group decision support system. The system is modeled by a multi agents system while exploiting a negotiation protocol based on mediation and concession. This protocol allows decision-makers to express their preferences using multicriteria analysis methods, mainly the method by total aggregation AHP (Hierarchical Process Analysis) and the method by partial aggregation PROMETHEE II .",

The system aims to represent diverse actors and their interactions within a group decision-making process."
