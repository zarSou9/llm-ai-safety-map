    "abstract": "In a knowledge society, the term knowledge must be considered a core resource for organizations. So, beyond being a medium to progress and to innovate, knowledge is one of our most important resources: something necessary to decide.Organizations that are embracing knowledge retention activities are gaining a competitive advantage. Organizational rearrangements from companies, notably outsourcing, increase a possible loss of knowledge, making knowledge retention an essential need for them. When Knowledge is less shared, collaborative decision-making seems harder to obtain insofar as a ``communication breakdown'' characterizes participants' discourse. At best, stakeholders have to finda consensus according to their knowledge. Sharing knowledge ensures its retention and catalyzes the construction of this consensus. Our vision of collaborative decision-making aims not only at increasing the quality of the first parts of the decision-making process: intelligence and design, but also at increasing the acceptance of the choice. Intelligence and design will be done by more than one individual and constructed together; the decision is more easily accepted. The decided choice will then be shared. Thereby where decision-making could be seen as a constructed model, collaborative decision-making, for us,is seen as the use of socio-technical media to improve decision-making performance and acceptability. The shared decision making is a core activity in a lot of human activities. For example, the sustainable decision-making is the job of not only governments and institutions but also broader society. Recognizing the urgent need for sustainability, we can argue that to realize sustainable development, it must be considered as a decision-making strategy. The location of knowledge in the realization of collaborative decision-making has to be regarded insofar as knowledge sharing leads to improve collaborative decision-making: a ``static view'' has to be structured and constitutes the ``collaborative knowledge.'' Knowledge has an important role in individual decision-making, and we consider that for collaborative decision-making, knowledge has to be shared. What is required is a better understanding of the nature of group work''. Knowledge has to be shared, but how do we share knowledge?",
    "summary": "The Decisioning Workshop 2023 highlights the crucial role of knowledge sharing in improving collaborative decision-making, arguing that shared knowledge enhances both the quality and acceptance of decisions by fostering consensus and mitigating knowledge loss from organizational changes. This collaborative approach is presented as a socio-technical model improving decision-making performance, particularly relevant for sustainable development initiatives."

    "published_date": "2023-05-15",
    "abstract": "Citizen-focused democratic processes where participants deliberate on alternatives and then vote to make the final decision are increasingly popular today. While the computational social choice literature has extensively investigated voting rules, there is limited work that explicitly looks at the interplay of the deliberative process and voting. In this paper, we build a deliberation model using established models from the opinion-dynamics literature and study the effect of different deliberation mechanisms on voting outcomes achieved when using well-studied voting rules. Our results show that deliberation generally improves welfare and representation guarantees, but the results are sensitive to how the deliberation process is organized. We also show, experimentally, that simple voting rules, such as approval voting, perform as well as more sophisticated rules such as proportional approval voting or method of equal shares if deliberation is properly supported. This has ramifications on the practical use of such voting rules in citizen-focused democratic processes.",

    "summary": "This paper models the impact of deliberation processes on multi-winner election outcomes using approval-based voting rules, finding that deliberation generally improves welfare and representation but is sensitive to its organization; simple rules like approval voting perform comparably to more complex methods when deliberation is effective."

    "title": "Composite Consensus-Building Process: Permissible Meeting Analysis and Compromise Choice Exploration",
    "published_date": "2022-11-16",
    "abstract": "In solving today's social issues, it is necessary to determine solutions that are acceptable to all stakeholders and collaborate to apply them. The conventional technology of\"permissive meeting analysis\"derives a consensusable choice that falls within everyone's permissible range through mathematical analyses; however, it tends to be biased toward the majority in a group, making it difficult to reach a consensus when a conflict arises. To support consensus building (defined here as an acceptable compromise that not everyone rejects), we developed a composite consensus-building process. The developed process addresses this issue by combining permissible meeting analysis with a new\"compromise choice-exploration\"technology, which presents a consensusable choice that emphasizes fairness and equality among everyone when permissible meeting analysis fails to do so. When both permissible meeting analysis and compromise choice exploration do not arrive at a consensus, a facility is provided to create a sublated choice among those provided by them. The trial experimental results confirmed that permissive meeting analysis and compromise choice exploration are sufficiently useful for deriving consensusable choices. Furthermore, we found that compromise choice exploration is characterized by its ability to derive choices that control the balance between compromise and fairness. Our proposed composite consensus-building approach could be applied in a wide range of situations, from local issues in municipalities and communities to international issues such as environmental protection and human rights issues. It could also aid in developing digital democracy and platform cooperativism.",
    "summary": "This paper introduces a composite consensus-building process that combines permissible meeting analysis with a novel compromise choice exploration method to achieve fairer and more equitable solutions, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on majority preferences. The process facilitates consensus even when initial analysis fails, offering a sublated choice as a final resort."

    "title": "Strategic Decisions: Survey, Taxonomy, and Future Directions from Artificial Intelligence Perspective",
    "published_date": "2022-10-22",
    "abstract": "Strategic Decision-Making is always challenging because it is inherently uncertain, ambiguous, risky, and complex. By contrast to tactical and operational decisions, strategic decisions are decisive, pivotal, and often irreversible, which may result in long-term and significant consequences. A strategic decision-making process usually involves many aspects of inquiry, including sensory perception, deliberative thinking, inquiry-based analysis, meta-learning, and constant interaction with the external world. Many unknowns, unpredictabilities, and environmental constraints will shape every aspect of a strategic decision. Traditionally, this task often relies on intuition, reflective thinking, visionary insights, approximate estimates, and practical wisdom. With recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) technologies, we can leverage AI/ML to support strategic decision-making. However, there is still a substantial gap from an AI perspective due to inadequate models, despite the tremendous progress made. We argue that creating a comprehensive taxonomy of decision frames as a representation space is essential for AI because it could offer surprising insights beyond anyone's imaginary boundary today. Strategic decision-making is the art of possibility. This study develops a systematic taxonomy of decision-making frames that consists of six bases, 18 categorical, and 54 elementary frames. We formulate the model using the inquiry method based on Bloom's taxonomy approach. We aim to lay out the computational foundation that is possible to capture a comprehensive landscape view of a strategic problem. Compared with many traditional models, this novel taxonomy covers irrational, non-rational and rational frames capable of dealing with certainty, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity, chaos, and ignorance.",
    "citation_count": 13,
    "summary": "This paper proposes a new taxonomy of strategic decision-making frames, encompassing rational, non-rational, and irrational approaches to handle various levels of uncertainty and complexity, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional methods and AI-supported strategic decision-making. The taxonomy, built using Bloom's taxonomy, provides a computational foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of strategic problems."

    "abstract": "Our contribution concerns interactive decision support systems for group decision support. Through this study, we apply to implement a decisional process aiming to represent the multiplicity of actors, their diversity, their behaviors and their interactions. In this context, we contribute to the design and development of a group decision support system. The system is modeled by a multi agents system while exploiting a negotiation protocol based on mediation and concession. This protocol allows decision-makers to express their preferences using multicriteria analysis methods, mainly the method by total aggregation AHP (Hierarchical Process Analysis) and the method by partial aggregation PROMETHEE II .",

    "published_date": "2021-06-14",
    "abstract": "Group deliberation enables people to collaborate and solve problems, however, it is understudied due to a lack of resources. To this end, we introduce the first publicly available dataset containing collaborative conversations on solving a well-established cognitive task, consisting of 500 group dialogues and 14k utterances. In 64% of these conversations, the group members are able to find a better solution than they had identified individually, and in 43.8% of the groups who had a correct answer as their final solution, none of the participants had solved the task correctly by themselves. Furthermore, we propose a novel annotation schema that captures deliberation cues and release all 14k utterances annotated with it. Finally, we use the proposed dataset to develop and evaluate two methods for generating deliberation utterances. The data collection platform, dataset and annotated corpus are publicly available at https://delibot.xyz.",

    "title": "An introduction to decision science for conservation",
    "abstract": "Biodiversity conservation decisions are difficult, especially when they involve differing values, complex multidimensional objectives, scarce resources, urgency, and considerable uncertainty. Decision science embodies a theory about how to make difficult decisions and an extensive array of frameworks and tools that make that theory practical. We sought to improve conceptual clarity and practical application of decision science to help decision makers apply decision science to conservation problems. We addressed barriers to the uptake of decision science, including a lack of training and awareness of decision science; confusion over common terminology and which tools and frameworks to apply; and the mistaken impression that applying decision science must be time consuming, expensive, and complex. To aid in navigating the extensive and disparate decision science literature, we clarify meaning of common terms: decision science, decision theory, decision analysis, structured decision‐making, and decision‐support tools. Applying decision science does not have to be complex or time consuming; rather, it begins with knowing how to think through the components of a decision utilizing decision analysis (i.e., define the problem, elicit objectives, develop alternatives, estimate consequences, and perform trade‐offs). This is best achieved by applying a rapid‐prototyping approach. At each step, decision‐support tools can provide additional insight and clarity, whereas decision‐support frameworks (e.g., priority threat management and systematic conservation planning) can aid navigation of multiple steps of a decision analysis for particular contexts. We summarize key decision‐support frameworks and tools and describe to which step of a decision analysis, and to which contexts, each is most useful to apply. Our introduction to decision science will aid in contextualizing current approaches and new developments, and help decision makers begin to apply decision science to conservation problems.",
