    "title": "Distributed Autonomous Organizations as Public Services Supplying Platform",
    "published_date": "2023-12-08",
    "abstract": "Servizi Elaborazioni Dati SpA is a public company owned by Municipality of L Aquila, it supplies the institution with network services and software applications for distributing services to citizens. The future policy of the company is to enlarge the offer of its services to nearby communities that are unable to set up and maintain their own network and software structures. This paper presents thus a possible architecture model to support small municipalities in supplying public services to citizens, with the aid of SED Spa. Through second level platforms based on Blockchain networks and Multi-agents Systems running on smart contracts, the system will focus on Waste Tax (Ta.Ri) management system in the Fascicolo del Cittadino environment.",

    "title": "Stakeholder Participation in AI: Beyond \"Add Diverse Stakeholders and Stir\"",
    "published_date": "2021-11-01",
    "abstract": "There is a growing consensus in HCI and AI research that the design of AI systems needs to engage and empower stakeholders who will be affected by AI. However, the manner in which stakeholders should participate in AI design is unclear. This workshop paper aims to ground what we dub a 'participatory turn' in AI design by synthesizing existing literature on participation and through empirical analysis of its current practices via a survey of recent published research and a dozen semi-structured interviews with AI researchers and practitioners. Based on our literature synthesis and empirical research, this paper presents a conceptual framework for analyzing participatory approaches to AI design and articulates a set of empirical findings that in ensemble detail out the contemporary landscape of participatory practice in AI design. These findings can help bootstrap a more principled discussion on how PD of AI should move forward across AI, HCI, and other research communities.",

    "title": "Human-centered Democratic Innovations with Digital and Participatory Elements",
    "abstract": "This paper discusses digital and/or participatory elements that could be used in decision-making processes, such as a participatory budgeting process. It contributes to the discussion about innovations in democracy. Placing humans at the center of governance, we argue that innovative elements should be evaluated by addressing the topic from the perspective of what is “good” for human beings? The process is good for them if it achieves goals like legitimacy and connection. We identify design of decision-making, participatory elements, and the value of personal interaction as levers. Regarding design of decision making, we discuss voting mechanisms, the combination of different decisions, and interdependent decisions in terms of each voter's choice optimality. In terms of participation, we see potential for blocked situations, for self-organized or requested (opt-in) participation, and for urgent or uncertain situations. Third, we emphasize the value of coming together in reality, and suggest thinking about combining digital and physical elements in a useful way. Technical aspects, power, and the existing institutional setting are identified as restrictions, and research into the effects of all these elements on the dependent variables, such as legitimacy and connection, is needed.",

    "title": "Towards a New Participatory Approach for Designing Artificial Intelligence and Data-Driven Technologies",
    "published_date": "2021-03-30",
    "abstract": "With there being many technical and ethical issues with artificial intelligence (AI) that involve marginalized communities, there is a growing interest for design methods used with marginalized people that may be transferable to the design of AI technologies. Participatory design (PD) is a design method that is often used with marginalized communities for the design of social development, policy, IT and other matters and solutions. However, there are issues with the current PD, raising concerns when it is applied to the design of technologies, including AI technologies. This paper argues for the use of PD for the design of AI technologies, and introduces and proposes a new PD, which we call agile participatory design, that not only can could be used for the design of AI and data-driven technologies, but also overcomes issues surrounding current PD and its use in the design of such technologies.",

    "title": "Facilitating Asynchronous Participatory Design of Open Source Software: Bringing End Users into the Loop",
    "published_date": "2021-02-24",
    "abstract": "As open source software (OSS) becomes increasingly mature and popular, there are significant challenges with properly accounting for usability concerns for the diverse end users. Participatory design, where multiple stakeholders collaborate on iterating the design, can be an efficient way to address the usability concerns for OSS projects. However, barriers such as a code-centric mindset and insufficient tool support often prevent OSS teams from effectively including end users in participatory design methods. This paper proposes preliminary contributions to this problem through the user-centered exploration of (1) a set of design guidelines that capture the needs of OSS participatory design tools, (2) two personas that represent the characteristics of OSS designers and end users, and (3) a low-fidelity prototype tool for end user involvement in OSS projects. This work paves the road for future studies about tool design that would eventually help improve OSS usability.",

    "title": "Exploring the Smart City Adoption Process: Evidence from the Belgian Urban Context",
    "published_date": "2021-01-14",
    "abstract": "In this position paper, we explore the adoption of a Smart City with a socio-technical perspective. A Smart city is a transformational technological process leading to profound modifications of existing urban regimes and infrastructure components. In this study, we consider a Smart City as a socio-technical system where the interplay between technologies and users ensures the sustainable development of smart city initiatives that improve the quality of life and solve important socio-economic problems. The adoption of a Smart City required a participative approach where users are involved during the adoption process to joint optimise both systems. Thus, we contribute to socio-technical research showing how a participative approach based on press relationships to facilitate information exchange between municipal actors and citizens worked as a success factor for the smart city adoption. We also discuss the limitations of this approach.",

    "title": "Mechanism Design Powered by Social Interactions",
    "published_date": "2021-02-20",
    "abstract": "Mechanism design has traditionally assumed that the set of participants are fixed and known to the mechanism (the market owner) in advance. However, in practice, the market owner can only directly reach a small number of participants (her neighbours). Hence the owner often needs costly promotions to recruit more participants in order to get desirable outcomes such as social welfare or revenue maximization. In this paper, we propose to incentivize existing participants to invite their neighbours to attract more participants. However, they would not invite each other if they are competitors. We discuss how to utilize the conflict of interest between the participants to incentivize them to invite each other to form larger markets. We will highlight the early solutions and open the floor for discussing the fundamental open questions in the settings of auctions, coalitional games, matching and voting.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a mechanism design approach that leverages social interactions, incentivizing existing participants to recruit new participants to improve market outcomes (like social welfare or revenue) by exploiting the conflict of interest between participants. The authors explore solutions and open questions for various settings including auctions, coalitional games, matching, and voting."

    "published_date": "2021-03-30",
    "abstract": "Sustainable innovation requires in-time development, diversification and transformation of business models from one to another. Business model innovation, development and transformation for sustainability incorporates economic, environmental and social value by advancing the management of the stakeholders into the business model. Except a little research on business model inter-dependencies, scant research has been done on stakeholder's interdependencies in order to understand their nature and relationship while developing or transforming a business model and creating an impact on environment, society and economy. Therefore, current research uses actor dependency model to analyze four different kind of inter-dependencies, namely, goal-dependency, task-dependency, resource-dependency and soft-goal dependency. The ecology of business model experimentation map is used as a tool for practical understanding of sustainable business modelling with a multiactor approach in a workshop setting. The findings will help to understand how stakeholders depend on each other while developing a business model for sustainability and innovation.",
    "summary": "This paper investigates stakeholder interdependencies during sustainable business model innovation, employing the actor dependency model to analyze goal, task, resource, and soft-goal dependencies. Findings aim to illuminate how these interdependencies influence sustainable business model development and transformation."
