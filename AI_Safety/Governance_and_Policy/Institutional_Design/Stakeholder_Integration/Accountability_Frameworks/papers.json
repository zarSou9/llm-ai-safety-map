    "title": "Unified External Stakeholder Engagement and Requirements Strategy",
    "published_date": "2024-09-08",
    "abstract": "Understanding stakeholder needs is essential for project success, as stakeholder importance varies across projects. This study proposes a framework for early stakeholder identification and continuous engagement throughout the project lifecycle. The framework addresses common organizational failures in stakeholder communication that lead to project delays and cancellations. By classifying stakeholders by influence and interest, establishing clear communication channels, and implementing regular feedback loops, the framework ensures effective stakeholder involvement. This approach allows for necessary project adjustments and builds long-term relationships, validated by a survey of IT professionals. Engaging stakeholders strategically at all stages minimizes misunderstandings and project risks, contributing to better project management and lifecycle outcomes.",

    "title": "Mapping and Comparing Data Governance Frameworks: A benchmarking exercise to inform global data governance deliberations",
    "published_date": "2023-02-27",
    "abstract": "Data has become a critical resource for organizations and society. Yet, it is not always as valuable as it could be since there is no well-defined approach to managing and using it. This article explores the increasing importance of global data governance due to the rapid growth of data and the need for responsible data use and protection. While historically associated with private organizational governance, data governance has evolved to include governmental and institutional bodies. However, the lack of a global consensus and fragmentation in policies and practices pose challenges to the development of a common framework. The purpose of this report is to compare approaches and identify patterns in the emergent and fragmented data governance ecosystem within sectors close to the international development field, ultimately presenting key takeaways and reflections on when and why a global data governance framework may be needed. Overall, the report highlights the need for a more holistic, coordinated transnational approach to data governance to manage the global flow of data responsibly and for the public interest. The article begins by giving an overview of the current fragmented data governance ecology, to then proceed to illustrate the methodology used. Subsequently, the paper illustrates the most relevant findings stemming from the research. These are organized according to six key elements: (a) purpose, (b) principles, (c) anchoring documents, (d) data description and lifecycle, (e) processes, and (f) practices. Finally, the article closes with a series of key takeaways and final reflections.",

    "title": "Towards a multi-stakeholder value-based assessment framework for algorithmic systems",
    "published_date": "2022-05-09",
    "abstract": "In an effort to regulate Machine Learning-driven (ML) systems, current auditing processes mostly focus on detecting harmful algorithmic biases. While these strategies have proven to be impactful, some values outlined in documents dealing with ethics in ML-driven systems are still underrepresented in auditing processes. Such unaddressed values mainly deal with contextual factors that cannot be easily quantified. In this paper, we develop a value-based assessment framework that is not limited to bias auditing and that covers prominent ethical principles for algorithmic systems. Our framework presents a circular arrangement of values with two bipolar dimensions that make common motivations and potential tensions explicit. In order to operationalize these high-level principles, values are then broken down into specific criteria and their manifestations. However, some of these value-specific criteria are mutually exclusive and require negotiation. As opposed to some other auditing frameworks that merely rely on ML researchers' and practitioners' input, we argue that it is necessary to include stakeholders that present diverse standpoints to systematically negotiate and consolidate value and criteria tensions. To that end, we map stakeholders with different insight needs, and assign tailored means for communicating value manifestations to them. We, therefore, contribute to current ML auditing practices with an assessment framework that visualizes closeness and tensions between values and we give guidelines on how to operationalize them, while opening up the evaluation and deliberation process to a wide range of stakeholders.",
    "citation_count": 23,
    "summary": "This paper proposes a multi-stakeholder value-based assessment framework for algorithmic systems, moving beyond bias detection to encompass broader ethical principles through a circular model visualizing value tensions and operationalized criteria, requiring stakeholder negotiation for resolution. The framework incorporates diverse stakeholder perspectives to ensure comprehensive value assessment."

    "title": "An integrative framework for stakeholder engagement: reconciling and integrating stakeholders' conflicting CSR priorities in management decision-making",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT CSR implementation is inextricably linked with effective stakeholder engagement, and integrating stakeholders' CSR priorities in management decision-making a prerequisite for effective stakeholder engagement. While the literature points to the need to build such linkages, no mechanism exists that reconciles never mind integrates stakeholders' (often conflicting) views. Addressing these omissions, we propose that there is a need for a framework that (1) reconciles and integrates the often conflicting priorities of stakeholders; (2) helps to construct a 'unified' CSR index inclusive of all stakeholders' views; (3) fosters consensus-driven management decision-making; and thereby (4) facilitates effective CSR stakeholder engagement and implementation. We construct an 'AHP-based Integrative Framework for Stakeholder Engagement'. We construct a 'unified' combined CSR index for Saudi businesses as well as the wider Saudi society as external stakeholders based on 18 CSR indicators identified as relevant through primary data collection. Based on combined rankings for the 18 CSR indicators, the most desirable 'common' CSR attributes are determined for all stakeholders. Notably, the popular notion that the Saudis view CSR in terms of philanthropy as a means of fulfiling their charitable obligations is not supported. The 'AHP-based Integrative Framework for Stakeholder Engagement' delivers measurable and transparent consensus-driven objective decision-making in setting CSR priorities inclusive of all (internal and external) stakeholders' views enabling participatory stakeholder engagement and CSR implementation, as well as objective CSR evaluations and comparisons improving the performance-disclosure gap. While this research focuses on CSR, we demonstrate the 'AHP-based Integrative Framework for Stakeholder Engagement' serves as a general framework that delivers effective stakeholder engagement in any management decision-making reconciling and integrating various stakeholders' often conflicting priorities into common objectives thereby enabling organisations the best possible informed management decisions inclusive of all (internal and external) stakeholders views.",

    "title": "Integrating On-chain and Off-chain Governance for Supply Chain Transparency and Integrity",
    "published_date": "2021-11-11",
    "abstract": "Integrating on-chain and off-chain data storage for decentralised and distributed information systems, such as blockchain, presents specific challenges for providing transparency of data governance and ensuring data integrity through stakeholder engagement. Current research on blockchain-based supply chains focuses on using on-chain governance rules developed for cryptocurrency blockchains to store some critical data points without designing tailored on-chain governance mechanisms and disclosing off-chain decision-making processes on data governance. In response to this research gap, this paper presents an integrated data governance framework that coordinates supply chain stakeholders with inter-linked on-chain and off-chain governance to disclose on-chain and off-chain rules and decision-making processes for supply chain transparency and integrity. We present a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) of our integrated data governance approach and suggest future research to strengthen scaling up and supply chain-based use cases based on our learnings.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes an integrated on-chain and off-chain data governance framework for blockchain-based supply chains, aiming to improve transparency and integrity by coordinating stakeholder engagement and disclosing both on-chain and off-chain governance rules and decision-making processes. A proof-of-concept is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach."

    "title": "Stakeholder Participation in AI: Beyond \"Add Diverse Stakeholders and Stir\"",
    "published_date": "2021-11-01",
    "abstract": "There is a growing consensus in HCI and AI research that the design of AI systems needs to engage and empower stakeholders who will be affected by AI. However, the manner in which stakeholders should participate in AI design is unclear. This workshop paper aims to ground what we dub a 'participatory turn' in AI design by synthesizing existing literature on participation and through empirical analysis of its current practices via a survey of recent published research and a dozen semi-structured interviews with AI researchers and practitioners. Based on our literature synthesis and empirical research, this paper presents a conceptual framework for analyzing participatory approaches to AI design and articulates a set of empirical findings that in ensemble detail out the contemporary landscape of participatory practice in AI design. These findings can help bootstrap a more principled discussion on how PD of AI should move forward across AI, HCI, and other research communities.",

    "summary": "This paper analyzes current stakeholder participation in AI design, finding that while engagement is increasing, methods remain unclear. It proposes a framework for analyzing participatory approaches based on literature review and empirical research, aiming to improve future AI development practices."

    "title": "Stakeholders interdependencies and their role in sustainable business model innovation",
    "published_date": "2021-03-30",
    "abstract": "Sustainable innovation requires in-time development, diversification and transformation of business models from one to another. Business model innovation, development and transformation for sustainability incorporates economic, environmental and social value by advancing the management of the stakeholders into the business model. Except a little research on business model inter-dependencies, scant research has been done on stakeholder's interdependencies in order to understand their nature and relationship while developing or transforming a business model and creating an impact on environment, society and economy. Therefore, current research uses actor dependency model to analyze four different kind of inter-dependencies, namely, goal-dependency, task-dependency, resource-dependency and soft-goal dependency. The ecology of business model experimentation map is used as a tool for practical understanding of sustainable business modelling with a multiactor approach in a workshop setting. The findings will help to understand how stakeholders depend on each other while developing a business model for sustainability and innovation.",
    "summary": "This paper investigates stakeholder interdependencies in sustainable business model innovation, employing the actor dependency model to analyze four types of dependencies and using an ecology of business model experimentation map to understand their practical application. The research aims to clarify how stakeholder relationships influence the development of sustainable business models."

    "title": "Towards an Enabling Environment for Social Accountability in Bangladesh.",
    "published_date": "2018-03-30",
    "abstract": "Social accountability refers to promoting good governance by making ruling elites more responsive. In Bangladesh, where bureaucracy and legislature operate with little effective accountability or checks and balances, traditional horizontal or vertical accountability proved to be very blunt and weak. In the presence of such faulty mechanisms, ordinary citizen's access to information is frequently denied, and their voices are kept mute. It impasses the formation of an enabling environment, where activists and civil society institutions representing the ordinary people's interest are actively discouraged. They become vulnerable to retribution. Social accountability, on the other hand, provides an enabling environment for activists and civil society institutions to operate freely. Thus, leaders and administration become more accountable to people. An enabling environment means providing legal protection, enhancing the availability of information and increasing citizen voice, strengthening institutional and public service capacities and directing incentives that foster accountability. Donors allocate significant shares of resources to encouraging civil society to partner with elites rather than holding them accountable. This paper advocate for a stronger legal environment to protect critical civil society and whistle-blowers, and for independent grant-makers tasked with building strong, self-regulating social accountability institutions.",
    "summary": "This paper argues that weak accountability mechanisms in Bangladesh hinder social accountability initiatives, advocating for stronger legal protections for civil society and independent grant-making to foster self-regulating social accountability institutions. It critiques donor practices that prioritize partnerships with elites over holding them accountable."
