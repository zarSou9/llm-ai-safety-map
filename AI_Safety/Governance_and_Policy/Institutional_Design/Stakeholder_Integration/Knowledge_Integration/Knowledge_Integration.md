### Mini Description

Systems for effectively combining diverse forms of expertise and perspective, including technical knowledge, local wisdom, and lived experience.

### Description

Knowledge integration in AI governance institutions focuses on developing systematic approaches to combine and synthesize diverse forms of expertise, evidence, and understanding into coherent decision-making frameworks. This includes methods for evaluating and weighing different types of knowledge, from quantitative technical analyses to qualitative experiential insights, and creating processes that enable effective knowledge sharing and collective learning across stakeholder groups.

A central challenge lies in bridging epistemological differences between various knowledge systems and expertise domains. Technical AI knowledge must be integrated with policy expertise, ethical considerations, and local contextual understanding. This requires developing frameworks that can validate and incorporate different forms of evidence while maintaining scientific rigor and practical relevance. Research explores methods for knowledge elicitation, translation between different knowledge frameworks, and mechanisms for resolving conflicts between competing knowledge claims.

Current work focuses on developing structured approaches to knowledge synthesis, including formal methods for combining expert judgments, systems for capturing and utilizing tacit knowledge, and frameworks for integrating forecasting and scenario planning inputs. Particular attention is given to ensuring that integration processes remain robust under uncertainty and can adapt to emerging forms of knowledge as AI technology evolves. This includes exploring how to leverage AI systems themselves in supporting knowledge integration while maintaining human oversight and understanding.
