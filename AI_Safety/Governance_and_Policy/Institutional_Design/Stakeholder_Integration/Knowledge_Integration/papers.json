    "title": "5 Reasons Why Governments/Militaries Already Want AI for Information Warfare",
    "published_date": "2023-10-30",
    "summary": "Military information warfare, leveraging advanced psychological research, prioritizes influencing high-intelligence elites rather than the general population, and its capabilities are rapidly accelerating. This sophisticated form of warfare has historically been crucial for military success and is increasingly important in modern geopolitical conflicts."

    "published_date": "2021-06-07",
    "summary": "The \"Five Whys\" technique, borrowed from Lean methodology, helps identify root causes of problems by repeatedly asking \"why\" until the underlying issue is revealed. This iterative process, illustrated by an example tackling insufficient exercise, then generates multiple potential solutions for each identified cause."

    "title": "New paper: Long-Term Trajectories of Human Civilization",
    "published_date": "2018-08-12",
    "summary": "The paper argues for a dedicated field of study focusing on the long-term trajectories of human civilization, identifying four potential paths: status quo, catastrophe, technological transformation, and astronomical expansion. The authors contend that current decisions significantly impact these future trajectories and advocate for incorporating long-term consequences into present-day policymaking."

    "title": "The Vulnerable World Hypothesis (by Bostrom)",
    "published_date": "2018-11-06",
    "summary": "Nick Bostrom's \"The Vulnerable World Hypothesis\" argues that continued technological development significantly increases the likelihood of civilizational collapse unless global governance improves. This vulnerability stems from both the ease of creating devastating technologies and the lack of sufficient preventative measures and international cooperation to mitigate their risks."

    "published_date": "2016-02-22",
    "summary": "The author argues that the risk of a globally catastrophic bioweapon event, potentially leading to human extinction, is comparable to that of uncontrolled artificial intelligence, yet receives far less research attention. This near-term biorisk is amplified by the ease and low cost of creating highly lethal biological agents, making proactive research and mitigation crucial."

    "published_date": "2016-07-15",
    "summary": "Two surveys conducted in 2016 examined Wikipedia usage patterns across different audience segments, revealing significant variations in consumption and engagement levels. Results suggest that Wikipedia usage is heavily skewed towards a specific, potentially more \"elite\" and influential user profile, prompting a reassessment of the platform's social value."

    "published_date": "2015-03-27",
    "summary": "Analysis of Wikipedia page view data reveals a decline in traffic for many established pages, even as overall Wikipedia views remain relatively stable due to growth in mobile and new page creation. This decline, impacting some pages by 50-67%, suggests shifts in user interest and how information is accessed."
