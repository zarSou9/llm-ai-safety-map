    "published_date": "2021-04-06",
    "summary": "The standard epidemiological model poorly predicts COVID-19 infection rates across US states, failing to account for the surprisingly similar infection levels despite varying restrictions. A proposed \"vulnerability model,\" incorporating fluctuating individual susceptibility to infection, better explains the observed data and avoids inconsistencies of the standard model."

    "published_date": "2018-11-06",
    "summary": "Nick Bostrom's \"Vulnerable World Hypothesis\" posits that continued technological development increases the likelihood of civilization-ending events unless global governance significantly improves. This risk stems from both easily accessible destructive technologies and the incentives of powerful or numerous actors to utilize them in a semi-anarchic world."

    "published_date": "2018-08-12",
    "summary": "This paper advocates for the scientific and ethical study of humanity's long-term future, outlining four potential trajectories: status quo, catastrophe, technological transformation, and astronomical expansion. The authors argue that current decisions significantly impact these future outcomes and should be informed by this long-term perspective."

    "published_date": "2018-09-27",
    "summary": "A study using a public goods game with and without punishment mechanisms compared cooperation levels across diverse university student populations. The results, based on a limited portion of the study presented here, suggest that the presence or absence of punishment significantly impacts cooperation rates."

    "title": "Multi-area scale electric power and energy balance with high wind power penetration based STACKELBERG decision theory",
    "abstract": "In order to coordinate the electric power and energy balance with the space scales and spatial scales among different level dispatching center, a leader-follower hierarchical decision model is proposed for taking advantage of the wind speed complementary characteristic of multi regional wind farms. With the STACKELBERG decision strategies, a coordination decision model of the electric power and energy balance is to combine the bottom-up feasibility tests with the top-down target optimizing. The follower layers would give a commitment to the leader layer, and the leader layer would optimize the follower layers commitments and get an optimized agreement for all followers. A dynamic programming optimization method is employed for calculating the entire system balance plan. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decision-making structure fits to large-scale power system hierarchical dispatching and satisfy the coordination of various dispatching demand in different levels.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a hierarchical Stackelberg game model for coordinating multi-area electric power and energy balance with high wind power penetration, leveraging complementary wind speeds across regions. The model uses a top-down optimization approach guided by bottom-up feasibility checks to achieve a system-wide optimal balance plan."

    "title": "Bayesian Utility: Representing Preference by Probability Measures",
    "published_date": "2009-07-27",
    "summary": "Expected utility can be reformulated using two probability measures, \"probability\" (P) and \"shouldness\" (Q), where the expected utility of an event A is Q(A)/P(A). This representation allows for Bayesian updating of both P and Q and offers a geometric interpretation of preferences, highlighting the intertwined nature of probability and utility in decision-making."
