### Mini Description

Methods and frameworks for systematically identifying and categorizing relevant stakeholders, including criteria for determining stakeholder relevance and priority.

### Description

Stakeholder identification in AI governance focuses on developing systematic approaches to recognize and categorize individuals, groups, and entities who have legitimate interests in or may be significantly impacted by AI development and deployment. This includes creating frameworks to assess stakeholder relevance, establishing criteria for prioritization, and ensuring comprehensive coverage across different domains of impact and influence.

A key challenge lies in the dynamic and evolving nature of AI's societal impact, where new stakeholder groups may emerge as technology advances and applications expand. Traditional stakeholder analysis methods often struggle with unique aspects of AI governance, such as representing future generations, artificial agents, or groups who may be impacted in ways not yet fully understood. Research explores methods for proactive identification of potential stakeholders, including predictive modeling of AI's expanding influence and systematic approaches to uncovering indirect or non-obvious stakeholder relationships.

Current work focuses on developing more sophisticated frameworks that can account for varying levels of stake, different types of impact, and complex interconnections between stakeholder groups. This includes research on quantitative methods for stakeholder analysis, approaches to handling uncertainty in impact assessment, and techniques for identifying historically overlooked or marginalized stakeholders. Particular attention is given to ensuring that identification methods remain robust and adaptable as AI systems become more sophisticated and their societal implications evolve.
