    "title": "Unified External Stakeholder Engagement and Requirements Strategy",
    "published_date": "2024-09-08",
    "abstract": "Understanding stakeholder needs is essential for project success, as stakeholder importance varies across projects. This study proposes a framework for early stakeholder identification and continuous engagement throughout the project lifecycle. The framework addresses common organizational failures in stakeholder communication that lead to project delays and cancellations. By classifying stakeholders by influence and interest, establishing clear communication channels, and implementing regular feedback loops, the framework ensures effective stakeholder involvement. This approach allows for necessary project adjustments and builds long-term relationships, validated by a survey of IT professionals. Engaging stakeholders strategically at all stages minimizes misunderstandings and project risks, contributing to better project management and lifecycle outcomes.",

    "title": "Towards a multi-stakeholder value-based assessment framework for algorithmic systems",
    "published_date": "2022-05-09",
    "abstract": "In an effort to regulate Machine Learning-driven (ML) systems, current auditing processes mostly focus on detecting harmful algorithmic biases. While these strategies have proven to be impactful, some values outlined in documents dealing with ethics in ML-driven systems are still underrepresented in auditing processes. Such unaddressed values mainly deal with contextual factors that cannot be easily quantified. In this paper, we develop a value-based assessment framework that is not limited to bias auditing and that covers prominent ethical principles for algorithmic systems. Our framework presents a circular arrangement of values with two bipolar dimensions that make common motivations and potential tensions explicit. In order to operationalize these high-level principles, values are then broken down into specific criteria and their manifestations. However, some of these value-specific criteria are mutually exclusive and require negotiation. As opposed to some other auditing frameworks that merely rely on ML researchers' and practitioners' input, we argue that it is necessary to include stakeholders that present diverse standpoints to systematically negotiate and consolidate value and criteria tensions. To that end, we map stakeholders with different insight needs, and assign tailored means for communicating value manifestations to them. We, therefore, contribute to current ML auditing practices with an assessment framework that visualizes closeness and tensions between values and we give guidelines on how to operationalize them, while opening up the evaluation and deliberation process to a wide range of stakeholders.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a multi-stakeholder value-based assessment framework for algorithmic systems, moving beyond bias detection to encompass broader ethical principles through a circular model visualizing value tensions and providing operational criteria for negotiation among diverse stakeholders. The framework facilitates communication and deliberation to address contextual factors and achieve consensus on algorithmic system values."

    "title": "Identification and selection of stakeholder engagement strategies: case study of an Iranian oil and gas construction project",
    "abstract": "Abstract Despite emphasizing the great importance of stakeholder management, there is a gap in applying a decision support system to adopt sustainable strategies for stakeholder engagement and conflict resolution especially in oil and gas projects. This paper presents a new framework for adopting the strategies in one of the largest oil and gas projects in Iran. In this proposed framework, firstly, the hybrid SWOT analysis and fuzzy Delphi method are used to identify and rank the sustainable stakeholder engagement strategies for managing conflicts. Then, a mathematical programming model was proposed to select the optimal strategies to maximize stakeholder engagement. The findings indicate that the results of the hybrid SWOT analysis and fuzzy Delphi method and the mathematical programming model are the same and the high ranked strategies obtained by the hybrid SWOT analysis and fuzzy Delphi method are selected in the proposed mathematical programming model as well. Also, each selected strategy can cover more than one conflict and improve stakeholder engagement.",

    "title": "Stakeholders interdependencies and their role in sustainable business model innovation",
    "published_date": "2021-03-30",
    "abstract": "Sustainable innovation requires in-time development, diversification and transformation of business models from one to another. Business model innovation, development and transformation for sustainability incorporates economic, environmental and social value by advancing the management of the stakeholders into the business model. Except a little research on business model inter-dependencies, scant research has been done on stakeholder's interdependencies in order to understand their nature and relationship while developing or transforming a business model and creating an impact on environment, society and economy. Therefore, current research uses actor dependency model to analyze four different kind of inter-dependencies, namely, goal-dependency, task-dependency, resource-dependency and soft-goal dependency. The ecology of business model experimentation map is used as a tool for practical understanding of sustainable business modelling with a multiactor approach in a workshop setting. The findings will help to understand how stakeholders depend on each other while developing a business model for sustainability and innovation.",
    "summary": "This paper investigates stakeholder interdependencies in sustainable business model innovation, using the actor dependency model to analyze four types of dependencies and an ecology of business model experimentation map to understand their practical application in a multi-actor setting. The research aims to illuminate how stakeholder relationships impact sustainable business model development and transformation."

    "title": "Stakeholder Participation in AI: Beyond \"Add Diverse Stakeholders and Stir\"",
    "published_date": "2021-11-01",
    "abstract": "There is a growing consensus in HCI and AI research that the design of AI systems needs to engage and empower stakeholders who will be affected by AI. However, the manner in which stakeholders should participate in AI design is unclear. This workshop paper aims to ground what we dub a 'participatory turn' in AI design by synthesizing existing literature on participation and through empirical analysis of its current practices via a survey of recent published research and a dozen semi-structured interviews with AI researchers and practitioners. Based on our literature synthesis and empirical research, this paper presents a conceptual framework for analyzing participatory approaches to AI design and articulates a set of empirical findings that in ensemble detail out the contemporary landscape of participatory practice in AI design. These findings can help bootstrap a more principled discussion on how PD of AI should move forward across AI, HCI, and other research communities.",

    "summary": "This paper examines the current state of stakeholder participation in AI design, arguing that simply including diverse stakeholders is insufficient. It proposes a conceptual framework for analyzing participatory approaches based on a literature review and empirical research, aiming to guide more principled future practices."

    "published_date": "2021-07-11",
    "abstract": "The number of research articles in business and management has dramatically increased along with terminology, constructs(i.e., conceptual terms that describe a distinct entity), and measures. Proper classification of organizational performance constructs from research articles plays an important role in categorizing the literature and understanding to whom its research implications may be relevant. In this work, we classify constructs (i.e., concepts and terminology used to capture different aspects of organizational performance) in 125 research articles collected from ISI Web of Science database into a three-level categorization: (a) performance and non-performance categories (Level 0); (b) for performance constructs, stakeholder group-level of performance concerning investors, customers, employees, and the society (community and natural environment) (Level 1); and (c) for each stakeholder group-level, subcategories of different ways of measurement (Level 2). We observed that increasing contextual information with features extracted from surrounding sentences and external references improves classification of disaggregate-level labels, given limited training data. Our research has implications for computer-assisted construct identification and classification an essential step for research synthesis.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a three-level computer-assisted classification system for organizational performance constructs found in 125 research articles, categorizing them by performance/non-performance, stakeholder group (investors, customers, employees, society), and measurement method, demonstrating improved classification accuracy with added contextual information. The research aims to facilitate literature synthesis through automated construct identification and classification."

    "title": "Identifying Key Stakeholders as Part of Requirements Elicitation in Software Ecosystems",
    "abstract": "Software ecosystems (SECOs) involve a number of actors that work together for a shared market. The software products within the software ecosystem typically have a common technological platform, and consist of a keystone player at the center of the ecosystem with niche players addressing market segments the keystone player would otherwise not have access to. Stakeholder identification is critical to the financial and functional success of software development projects, however the task of identifying all stakeholders in a SECO is often not possible due to the high volume of stakeholders and open interfaces. The identification of key stakeholders should ensure that the most relevant requirements are elicited during a software planning cycle. The objective of this research is to examine how key stakeholders can be identified in complex SECOs. This research takes a design science approach and the main component of the current research is the design of an artifact in the form of a reference process model, that is applied in a real-world environment to develop a business process model. Consequently, this research aims to facilitate academia and industry in SECO optimization, especially from a requirements management perspective.",

    "title": "Linking Stakeholders' Viewpoint Concerns and Microservices-based Architecture",
    "published_date": "2020-09-03",
    "abstract": "Widespread adoption of agile project management, independent delivery with microservices, and automated deployment with DevOps has tremendously speedup the systems development. The real game-changer is continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery, and continuous deployment (CD). Organizations can do multiple releases a day, shortening the test, release, and deployment cycles from weeks to minutes. \nMaturity of container technologies like Docker and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes has promoted microservices architecture, especially in the cloud-native developments. Various tools are available for setting up CI/CD pipelines. Organizations are moving away from monolith applications and moving towards microservices-based architectures. Organizations can quickly accumulate hundreds of such microservices accessible via application programming interfaces (APIs). \nThe primary purpose of these modern methodologies is agility, speed, and reusability. While DevOps offers speed and time to market, agility and reusability may not be guaranteed unless microservices and API's are linked to enterprise-wide stakeholders' needs. The link between business needs and microservices/APIs is not well captured nor adequately defined. \nIn this publication, we describe a structured method to create a logical link among APIs and microservices-based agile developments with enterprise stakeholders' needs and viewpoint concerns. This method enables capturing and documenting enterprise-wide stakeholders' needs, whether these are business owners, planners (product owners, architects), designers (developers, DevOps engineers), or the partners and subscribers of an enterprise.",
