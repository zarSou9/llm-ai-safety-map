    "title": "Stakeholder-driven research in the European Climate and Energy Modelling Forum",
    "published_date": "2024-06-03",
    "abstract": "A fast-paced policy context is characteristic of energy and climate research, which strives to develop solutions to wicked problems such as climate change. Funding agencies in the European Union recognize the importance of linking research and policy in climate and energy research. This calls for an increased understanding of how stakeholder engagement can effectively be used to co-design research questions that include stakeholders' concerns. This paper reviews the current literature on stakeholder engagement, from which we create a set of criteria. These are used to critically assess recent and relevant papers on stakeholder engagement in climate and energy projects. We obtained the papers from a scoping review of stakeholder engagement through workshops in EU climate and energy research. With insights from the literature and current EU climate and energy projects, we developed a workshop programme for stakeholder engagement. This programme was applied to the European Climate and Energy Modelling Forum project, aiming to co-design the most pressing and urgent research questions according to European stakeholders. The outcomes include 82 co-designed and ranked research questions for nine specific climate and energy research themes. Findings from the scoping review indicate that papers rarely define the term 'stakeholder'. Additionally, the concepts of co-creation, co-design, and co-production are used interchangeably and often without definition. We propose that workshop planners use stakeholder identification and selection methods from the broader stakeholder engagement literature.",
    "summary": "This paper examines stakeholder engagement in European climate and energy research, developing criteria to assess existing practices and applying them to a workshop program within the European Climate and Energy Modelling Forum to co-design 82 prioritized research questions across nine thematic areas. The study highlights a need for clearer definitions of key terms like \"stakeholder\" and consistent application of co-creation methodologies in research design."

    "title": "Unified External Stakeholder Engagement and Requirements Strategy",
    "published_date": "2024-09-08",
    "abstract": "Understanding stakeholder needs is essential for project success, as stakeholder importance varies across projects. This study proposes a framework for early stakeholder identification and continuous engagement throughout the project lifecycle. The framework addresses common organizational failures in stakeholder communication that lead to project delays and cancellations. By classifying stakeholders by influence and interest, establishing clear communication channels, and implementing regular feedback loops, the framework ensures effective stakeholder involvement. This approach allows for necessary project adjustments and builds long-term relationships, validated by a survey of IT professionals. Engaging stakeholders strategically at all stages minimizes misunderstandings and project risks, contributing to better project management and lifecycle outcomes.",

    "title": "Dance of the DAOs: Building Data Assets as a Use Case",
    "published_date": "2023-01-14",
    "abstract": "Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) have recently piqued the interest of participants from diverse backgrounds, including business owners, engineers, individual and institutional investors. In part, the promised autonomy (less rigid structure and more voice) in decision making along with ease of market access, has resulted in its participants pouring in their time and economic resources. In a DAO, governance is typically enacted via posting proposals and collectively voting on it. The winning proposals are then implemented. However, governance alone may be insufficient, when its participants economic incentives are misaligned. Governance and tokenomics need to work in tandem to ensure business stability. We present a case study on an example building data asset from the construction industry and present its tokenomics. We show its working, both as a caretaker and strategic DAO, to illustrate its effects on governance and DAO stability. The case study serves as an example for participants to decide whether their DAO tokenomics are aligned with participation incentives. Finally, we propose the DAO tension quadrilateral to study DAO stability and build a tool to measure agreement among its participants.",
    "summary": "This paper uses a construction industry data asset case study to demonstrate how aligning tokenomics with governance is crucial for Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) stability, proposing a \"DAO tension quadrilateral\" to measure participant agreement and assess this alignment."

    "title": "Stakeholder Participation in AI: Beyond \"Add Diverse Stakeholders and Stir\"",
    "published_date": "2021-11-01",
    "abstract": "There is a growing consensus in HCI and AI research that the design of AI systems needs to engage and empower stakeholders who will be affected by AI. However, the manner in which stakeholders should participate in AI design is unclear. This workshop paper aims to ground what we dub a 'participatory turn' in AI design by synthesizing existing literature on participation and through empirical analysis of its current practices via a survey of recent published research and a dozen semi-structured interviews with AI researchers and practitioners. Based on our literature synthesis and empirical research, this paper presents a conceptual framework for analyzing participatory approaches to AI design and articulates a set of empirical findings that in ensemble detail out the contemporary landscape of participatory practice in AI design. These findings can help bootstrap a more principled discussion on how PD of AI should move forward across AI, HCI, and other research communities.",

    "published_date": "2021-03-30",
    "abstract": "Sustainable innovation requires in-time development, diversification and transformation of business models from one to another. Business model innovation, development and transformation for sustainability incorporates economic, environmental and social value by advancing the management of the stakeholders into the business model. Except a little research on business model inter-dependencies, scant research has been done on stakeholder's interdependencies in order to understand their nature and relationship while developing or transforming a business model and creating an impact on environment, society and economy. Therefore, current research uses actor dependency model to analyze four different kind of inter-dependencies, namely, goal-dependency, task-dependency, resource-dependency and soft-goal dependency. The ecology of business model experimentation map is used as a tool for practical understanding of sustainable business modelling with a multiactor approach in a workshop setting. The findings will help to understand how stakeholders depend on each other while developing a business model for sustainability and innovation.",

    "published_date": "2021-11-11",
    "abstract": "Integrating on-chain and off-chain data storage for decentralised and distributed information systems, such as blockchain, presents specific challenges for providing transparency of data governance and ensuring data integrity through stakeholder engagement. Current research on blockchain-based supply chains focuses on using on-chain governance rules developed for cryptocurrency blockchains to store some critical data points without designing tailored on-chain governance mechanisms and disclosing off-chain decision-making processes on data governance. In response to this research gap, this paper presents an integrated data governance framework that coordinates supply chain stakeholders with inter-linked on-chain and off-chain governance to disclose on-chain and off-chain rules and decision-making processes for supply chain transparency and integrity. We present a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) of our integrated data governance approach and suggest future research to strengthen scaling up and supply chain-based use cases based on our learnings.",

    "title": "Shadow organising: emerging stakeholder collaboration in higher education to enhance quality",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Much research is currently addressing how to establish, maintain and govern stakeholder collaboration in higher education. In this article, the concept of shadow organising, i.e. stakeholder imitation of formal educational provision, is introduced to illustrate bottom-up, proactive ways to connect multiple autonomous organisations and stakeholder groups within and outside universities (such as professional bodies, employers and student unions). The article exemplifies the concept of shadow organising by analysing emerging stakeholder collaboration in legal education. The case illustrates the collaborative but informal efforts of a range of supporting actors. The results show that the actors are connected to each other through concrete and practical actions, instead of agreements, regulations or partnerships, which have stabilised into a widespread latticework of interlinked activities: training law students, hiring law graduates, supervising learning processes and instituting quality control. Simultaneously, however, actors maintain their distinctive roles, identities and mandates without initiating official collaboration or a common discussion of objectives and rationales.",

    "title": "Risk in work integrated learning: a stakeholder centric model for higher education",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Work Integrated Learning (WIL) increases the 'work readiness' of university graduates but it is a complex undertaking and involves numerous risks for the stakeholders involved. A systematic review of the literature published between 2012 and 2017 reveals that the discourses related to risk and WIL are quite limited with the perspectives of key stakeholders receiving little attention. To address these shortcomings, a stakeholder centric model is proposed that conceptualises risk as a network of potentially fragile relationships and interactions, centred on the student, and involving all key WIL stakeholders. This Stakeholder Interaction (SI) model provides a framework for the analysis of risk from the perspectives of each stakeholder in turn and as such, has the potential to inform the management of risk in WIL more broadly and address some gaps in academic discourse and practice.",

    "title": "Designing for Participation and Change in Digital Institutions",
    "published_date": "2019-02-23",
    "abstract": "Whether we recognize it or not, the Internet is rife with exciting and original institutional forms that are transforming social organization on and offline. Issues of governance in these Internet platforms and other digital institutions have posed a challenge for software engineers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. Here, we offer one useful framework with an aim to stimulate dialogue between computer scientists and political scientists. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm, a collection of atheoretical approaches such as A/B-testing, and incremental issue-driven software engineering. One institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the design of traditional institutions is the body of resource governance literature known as the \"Ostrom Workshop\". A key finding of this literature that has yet to be broadly incorporated in the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change process mechanisms in what is called a \"constitutional layer\" of institutional design---in other words, defining rules that allow and facilitate diverse stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent this consideration is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions.",

    "summary": "This paper argues that digital institution design should incorporate participatory change mechanisms, drawing on the \"Ostrom Workshop\" framework to advocate for a \"constitutional layer\" enabling diverse stakeholder involvement in ongoing design modifications, as illustrated through case studies of cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and Minecraft servers."

    "published_date": "2018-09-11",
    "abstract": "To survive a learning management system (LMS) implementation an understanding of the needs of the various stakeholders is necessary. The goal of every LMS implementation is to ensure the use of the system by instructors and students to enhance teaching and communication thereby enhancing learning outcomes of the students. If the teachers and students do not use the system, the system is useless. This research is motivated by the importance of identifying and understanding various stakeholders involved in the LMS implementation process in order to anticipate possible challenges and identify critical success factors essential for the effective implementation and adoption of a new LMS system. To this end, we define the term stakeholder. We conducted a stakeholder analysis to identify the key stakeholders in an LMS implementation process. We then analyze their goals and needs, and how they collaborate in the implementation process. The findings of this work will provide institutions of higher learning an overview of the implementation process and useful insights into the needs of the stakeholders, which will in turn ensure an increase in the level of success achieved when implementing a LMS.",

    "summary": "This paper argues that successful Learning Management System (LMS) implementation hinges on understanding and addressing the needs of all stakeholders, including instructors and students, to ensure system adoption and improved learning outcomes. A stakeholder analysis is used to identify key players, their goals, and collaborative needs for effective LMS implementation."
