    "title": "How to Manage My Data? With Machine-Interpretable GDPR Rights!",
    "published_date": "2024-12-19",
    "abstract": "The EU GDPR is a landmark regulation that introduced several rights for individuals to obtain information and control how their personal data is being processed, as well as receive a copy of it. However, there are gaps in the effective use of rights due to each organisation developing custom methods for rights declaration and management. Simultaneously, there is a technological gap as there is no single consistent standards-based mechanism that can automate the handling of rights for both organisations and individuals. In this article, we present a specification for exercising and managing rights in a machine-interpretable format based on semantic web standards. Our approach uses the comprehensive Data Privacy Vocabulary to create a streamlined workflow for individuals to understand what rights exist, how and where to exercise them, and for organisations to effectively manage them. This work pushes the state of the art in GDPR rights management and is crucial for data reuse and rights management under technologically intensive developments, such as Data Spaces.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a machine-interpretable specification for GDPR data rights management, using semantic web standards and a comprehensive data privacy vocabulary to streamline both individual access and organizational compliance. This aims to address current inconsistencies and technological limitations in GDPR rights handling."

    "title": "SecureRights: A Blockchain-Powered Trusted DRM Framework for Robust Protection and Asserting Digital Rights",
    "published_date": "2024-03-10",
    "abstract": "In the dynamic realm of digital content, safeguarding intellectual property rights poses critical challenges. This paper presents\"SecureRights,\"an innovative Blockchain-based Trusted Digital Rights Management (DRM) framework. It strengthens the defence against unauthorized use and streamlines the claim of digital rights. Utilizing blockchain, digital watermarking, perceptual hashing, Quick Response (QR) codes, and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), SecureRights securely stores watermark information on the blockchain with timestamp authentication. Incorporating perceptual hashing generates robust hash tokens based on image structure. The addition of QR codes enhances the watermarking, offering a comprehensive solution for resilient intellectual property rights protection. Rigorous evaluations affirm SecureRights' resilience against various attacks, establishing its efficacy in safeguarding digital content and simplifying rightful ownership assertion.",
    "summary": "SecureRights is a blockchain-based DRM framework using digital watermarking, perceptual hashing, QR codes, and IPFS to enhance digital rights protection and verification, offering robust resilience against unauthorized access and simplifying ownership claims. Its efficacy is validated through rigorous testing against various attacks."

    "title": "Internet Of Rights(IOR) In Role Based Block Chain",
    "published_date": "2022-11-02",
    "abstract": "A large amount of data has been accumulated. with the development of the Internet industry. Many problems have been exposed with data explosion: 1. The contradiction between data privacy and data collaborations; 2. The contradiction between data ownership and the right of data usage; 3. The legality of data collection and data usage; 4. The relationship between the governance of data and the governance of rules; 5. Traceability of evidence chain. In order to face such a complicated situation, many algorithms were proposed and developed. This article tries to build a model from the perspective of blockchain to make some breakthroughs.Internet Of Rights(IOR) model uses multi-chain technology to logically break down the consensus mechanism into layers, including storage consensus, permission consensus, role consensus, transaction consensus etc. thus to build a new infrastructure, which enables data sources with complex organizational structures and interactions to collaborate smoothly on the premise of protecting data privacy. With blockchain's nature of decentralization, openness, autonomy, immutability, and controllable anonymity, Internet Of Rights(IOR) model registers the ownership of data, enables applications to build ecosystem based on responsibilities and rights. It also provides cross-domain processing with privacy protection, as well as the separation of data governance and rule governance. With the processing capabilities of artificial intelligence and big data technology, as well as the ubiquitous data collection capabilities of the Internet of Things, Internet Of Rights(IOR) model may provide a new infrastructure concept for realizing swarm intelligence and building a new paradigm of the Internet, i.e. intelligent governance.",
    "summary": "The Internet of Rights (IOR) model leverages blockchain's multi-chain technology to address data privacy and ownership conflicts, creating a secure and transparent infrastructure for data collaboration while maintaining accountability and enabling intelligent governance. This is achieved through layered consensus mechanisms focusing on roles and permissions, allowing for cross-domain data processing with privacy protection."

    "published_date": "2022-09-20",
    "abstract": "The Advanced Data Protection Control (ADPC) is a technical specification - and a set of sociotechnical mechanisms surrounding it - that can change the current practice of Internet-based personal data protection and consenting by providing novel and standardized means for the communication of privacy and consenting data, meta-data, information, requests, preferences, and decisions. The ADPC supports humans in practicing their rights to privacy and agency by giving them more human-centric control over the processing of their personal data and consent. It helps the data controllers to improve their users' experiences and provides them with easy-to-adopt means to comply with the relevant legal and ethical requirements and expectations.",

    "title": "A Human Rights-Based Approach to Responsible AI",
    "published_date": "2022-10-06",
    "abstract": "Research on fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics of AI-based interventions in society has gained much-needed momen-tum in recent years. However it lacks an explicit alignment with a set of normative values and principles that guide this research and interventions. Rather, an implicit consensus is often assumed to hold for the values we impart into our models – something that is at odds with the pluralistic world we live in. In this paper, we put forth the doctrine of universal human rights as a set of globally salient and cross-culturally recognized set of values that can serve as a grounding framework for explicit value alignment in responsible AI – and discuss its eﬃcacy as a framework for civil society partnership and participation. We argue that a human rights framework orients the research in this space away from the machines and the risks of their biases, and towards humans and the risks to their rights, essentially helping to center the conversation around who is harmed, what harms they face, and how those harms may be mitigated.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes using a human rights framework as a foundation for responsible AI development, arguing that this approach prioritizes the potential harms to individuals and offers a globally applicable ethical standard for value alignment in AI systems."
