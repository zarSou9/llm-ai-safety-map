### Mini Description

Establishment of techniques and procedures for formally verifying that AI systems meet specified safety requirements, including both static analysis and runtime verification approaches.

### Description

Verification methods for AI systems encompass the techniques and approaches used to formally demonstrate that an AI system meets specified safety requirements and behavioral constraints. Unlike traditional software verification, AI verification must contend with the complexity of learned behaviors, statistical nature of ML models, and challenges in formally specifying desired properties for systems operating in open-world environments.

Current approaches span multiple complementary strategies: formal methods that provide mathematical guarantees about system properties, runtime monitoring that verifies behavior during operation, and hybrid approaches that combine multiple verification techniques. Key challenges include scalability to large models, handling of probabilistic behaviors, verification of systems that continue learning after deployment, and development of specifications that capture safety properties while remaining tractable for verification.

Active research areas include abstract interpretation for neural networks, verification of reinforcement learning policies, compositional verification methods for large systems, and techniques for verifying properties of systems with learned components. There is particular focus on developing methods that can provide meaningful guarantees while remaining computationally feasible, as well as approaches for verifying properties of increasingly complex architectures like large language models and multi-agent systems.
