### Mini Description

Development of quantitative and qualitative measures for assessing AI system safety, including benchmarks, evaluation criteria, and success indicators.

### Description

Performance metrics for AI safety involve developing quantitative and qualitative measures to assess how well AI systems adhere to safety requirements and specifications. These metrics must capture both traditional software quality attributes like reliability and stability, as well as AI-specific concerns such as alignment, robustness to distribution shifts, and resistance to adversarial attacks. A key challenge is designing metrics that are both meaningful indicators of safety and practically measurable in real-world settings.

Current research focuses on developing metrics that can evaluate system behavior across different operational contexts and failure modes. This includes measures for assessing prediction accuracy and calibration, detecting out-of-distribution inputs, quantifying uncertainty estimation, and evaluating robustness to perturbations. Researchers are particularly interested in metrics that can provide early warning signals of potential safety violations or degrading performance before critical failures occur.

A significant open challenge is the development of metrics that can effectively evaluate more abstract safety properties such as value alignment, task completion faithfulness, and appropriate deference to human oversight. This requires combining traditional performance measures with novel approaches that can assess higher-level safety properties. There is also growing emphasis on developing metrics that remain meaningful as AI systems become more capable and complex, including measures for evaluating system transparency, interpretability, and the reliability of safety mechanisms.
