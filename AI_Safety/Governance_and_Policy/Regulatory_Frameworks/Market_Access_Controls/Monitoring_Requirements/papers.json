    "title": "Visibility into AI Agents",
    "published_date": "2024-01-23",
    "abstract": "Increased delegation of commercial, scientific, governmental, and personal activities to AI agents—systems capable of pursuing complex goals with limited supervision—may exacerbate existing societal risks and introduce new risks. Understanding and mitigating these risks involves critically evaluating existing governance structures, revising and adapting these structures where needed, and ensuring accountability of key stakeholders. Information about where, why, how, and by whom certain AI agents are used, which we refer to as visibility, is critical to these objectives. In this paper, we assess three categories of measures to increase visibility into AI agents: agent identifiers, real-time monitoring, and activity logging. For each, we outline potential implementations that vary in intrusiveness and informativeness. We analyze how the measures apply across a spectrum of centralized through decentralized deployment contexts, accounting for various actors in the supply chain including hardware and software service providers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our measures for privacy and concentration of power. Further work into understanding the measures and mitigating their negative impacts can help to build a foundation for the governance of AI agents.",

    "title": "The Role of Governments in Increasing Interconnected Post-Deployment Monitoring of AI",
    "published_date": "2024-10-07",
    "abstract": "Language-based AI systems are diffusing into society, bringing positive and negative impacts. Mitigating negative impacts depends on accurate impact assessments, drawn from an empirical evidence base that makes causal connections between AI usage and impacts. Interconnected post-deployment monitoring combines information about model integration and use, application use, and incidents and impacts. For example, inference time monitoring of chain-of-thought reasoning can be combined with long-term monitoring of sectoral AI diffusion, impacts and incidents. Drawing on information sharing mechanisms in other industries, we highlight example data sources and specific data points that governments could collect to inform AI risk management.",

    "summary": "This paper argues that interconnected post-deployment monitoring of AI systems, combining data on model use, application, and impacts, is crucial for mitigating negative consequences; it proposes government roles in collecting and sharing data to facilitate this comprehensive monitoring."

    "title": "Design of a Quality Management System based on the EU Artificial Intelligence Act",
    "published_date": "2024-08-08",
    "abstract": "The EU AI Act mandates that providers and deployers of high-risk AI systems establish a quality management system (QMS). Among other criteria, a QMS shall help verify and document the AI system design and quality and monitor the proper implementation of all high-risk AI system requirements. Current research rarely explores practical solutions for implementing the EU AI Act. Instead, it tends to focus on theoretical concepts. As a result, more attention must be paid to tools that help humans actively check and document AI systems and orchestrate the implementation of all high-risk AI system requirements. Therefore, this paper introduces a new design concept and prototype for a QMS as a microservice Software as a Service web application. It connects directly to the AI system for verification and documentation and enables the orchestration and integration of various sub-services, which can be individually designed, each tailored to specific high-risk AI system requirements. The first version of the prototype connects to the Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct LLM as an example of an AI system and integrates a risk management system and a data management system. The prototype is evaluated through a qualitative assessment of the implemented requirements, a GPU memory and performance analysis, and an evaluation with IT, AI, and legal experts.",

    "title": "From Transparency to Accountability and Back: A Discussion of Access and Evidence in AI Auditing",
    "published_date": "2024-10-07",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly intervening in our lives, raising widespread concern about its unintended and undeclared side effects. These developments have brought attention to the problem of AI auditing: the systematic evaluation and analysis of an AI system, its development, and its behavior relative to a set of predetermined criteria. Auditing can take many forms, including pre-deployment risk assessments, ongoing monitoring, and compliance testing. It plays a critical role in providing assurances to various AI stakeholders, from developers to end users. Audits may, for instance, be used to verify that an algorithm complies with the law, is consistent with industry standards, and meets the developer's claimed specifications. However, there are many operational challenges to AI auditing that complicate its implementation. In this work, we examine a key operational issue in AI auditing: what type of access to an AI system is needed to perform a meaningful audit? Addressing this question has direct policy relevance, as it can inform AI audit guidelines and requirements. We begin by discussing the factors that auditors balance when determining the appropriate type of access, and unpack the benefits and drawbacks of four types of access. We conclude that, at minimum, black-box access -- providing query access to a model without exposing its internal implementation -- should be granted to auditors, as it balances concerns related to trade secrets, data privacy, audit standardization, and audit efficiency. We then suggest a framework for determining how much further access (in addition to black-box access) to grant auditors. We show that auditing can be cast as a natural hypothesis test, draw parallels hypothesis testing and legal procedure, and argue that this framing provides clear and interpretable guidance on audit implementation.",
    "summary": "This paper examines the necessary level of access to AI systems for effective auditing, arguing that while full transparency is ideal, a minimum of black-box access (querying the model without internal details) is crucial for balancing competing interests like trade secrets and audit efficiency. The authors propose a framework for determining further access based on a hypothesis testing analogy."

    "title": "Computing Power and the Governance of Artificial Intelligence",
    "published_date": "2024-02-13",
    "abstract": "Computing power, or\"compute,\"is crucial for the development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. As a result, governments and companies have started to leverage compute as a means to govern AI. For example, governments are investing in domestic compute capacity, controlling the flow of compute to competing countries, and subsidizing compute access to certain sectors. However, these efforts only scratch the surface of how compute can be used to govern AI development and deployment. Relative to other key inputs to AI (data and algorithms), AI-relevant compute is a particularly effective point of intervention: it is detectable, excludable, and quantifiable, and is produced via an extremely concentrated supply chain. These characteristics, alongside the singular importance of compute for cutting-edge AI models, suggest that governing compute can contribute to achieving common policy objectives, such as ensuring the safety and beneficial use of AI. More precisely, policymakers could use compute to facilitate regulatory visibility of AI, allocate resources to promote beneficial outcomes, and enforce restrictions against irresponsible or malicious AI development and usage. However, while compute-based policies and technologies have the potential to assist in these areas, there is significant variation in their readiness for implementation. Some ideas are currently being piloted, while others are hindered by the need for fundamental research. Furthermore, naive or poorly scoped approaches to compute governance carry significant risks in areas like privacy, economic impacts, and centralization of power. We end by suggesting guardrails to minimize these risks from compute governance.",
    "citation_count": 16,
    "summary": "Governments and companies increasingly use control over computing power to govern artificial intelligence development and deployment, leveraging its quantifiable and controllable nature to promote beneficial AI and mitigate risks; however, effective implementation requires careful consideration of potential downsides, including privacy concerns and power centralization."

    "title": "Governing Through the Cloud: The Intermediary Role of Compute Providers in AI Regulation",
    "published_date": "2024-03-13",
    "abstract": "As jurisdictions around the world take their first steps toward regulating the most powerful AI systems, such as the EU AI Act and the US Executive Order 14110, there is a growing need for effective enforcement mechanisms that can verify compliance and respond to violations. We argue that compute providers should have legal obligations and ethical responsibilities associated with AI development and deployment, both to provide secure infrastructure and to serve as intermediaries for AI regulation. Compute providers can play an essential role in a regulatory ecosystem via four key capacities: as securers, safeguarding AI systems and critical infrastructure; as record keepers, enhancing visibility for policymakers; as verifiers of customer activities, ensuring oversight; and as enforcers, taking actions against rule violations. We analyze the technical feasibility of performing these functions in a targeted and privacy-conscious manner and present a range of technical instruments. In particular, we describe how non-confidential information, to which compute providers largely already have access, can provide two key governance-relevant properties of a computational workload: its type-e.g., large-scale training or inference-and the amount of compute it has consumed. Using AI Executive Order 14110 as a case study, we outline how the US is beginning to implement record keeping requirements for compute providers. We also explore how verification and enforcement roles could be added to establish a comprehensive AI compute oversight scheme. We argue that internationalization will be key to effective implementation, and highlight the critical challenge of balancing confidentiality and privacy with risk mitigation as the role of compute providers in AI regulation expands.",
    "citation_count": 4,
    "summary": "The paper proposes leveraging cloud compute providers as intermediaries in AI regulation, arguing they can act as securers, record keepers, verifiers, and enforcers of AI compliance through existing infrastructure and data access. This approach necessitates balancing privacy concerns with effective oversight and international cooperation."
