### Mini Description

Ongoing surveillance and reporting obligations for deployed AI systems, including performance tracking, incident reporting, and periodic reviews.

### Description

Monitoring requirements for AI systems encompass the ongoing surveillance, measurement, and reporting mechanisms needed to ensure deployed AI systems continue to operate safely and as intended. These requirements establish frameworks for tracking system performance, detecting anomalies or degradation, and maintaining accountability throughout the system's operational lifecycle. The challenge lies in designing monitoring approaches that can effectively capture relevant indicators while remaining practically implementable and resource-efficient.

Current research focuses on developing robust metrics and measurement frameworks that can detect both obvious failures and subtle deviations in AI system behavior. This includes methods for monitoring technical performance metrics, tracking alignment with intended objectives, and identifying potential negative impacts on stakeholders. Particular attention is given to developing monitoring systems that can adapt to evolving AI capabilities and detect emergent behaviors that may not have been anticipated during initial assessment.

A key area of investigation is the development of monitoring architectures that balance transparency with security, and autonomy with human oversight. This includes determining appropriate monitoring frequencies, establishing thresholds for intervention, and designing effective reporting mechanisms. Researchers are also exploring how to implement monitoring systems that remain reliable even as AI systems become more complex and potentially less interpretable, including the use of automated monitoring tools and the role of third-party auditors.
