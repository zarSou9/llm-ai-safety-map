### Mini Description

Rules and conditions governing where, when, and how approved AI systems can be deployed, including sector-specific requirements and usage limitations.

### Description

Deployment restrictions encompass the specific rules, conditions, and limitations placed on where, when, and how approved AI systems can be implemented in real-world settings. These restrictions aim to manage risks while allowing beneficial applications, taking into account factors such as the system's capabilities, intended use cases, potential for misuse, and the sensitivity of the deployment context.

A key challenge in designing deployment restrictions is determining appropriate granularity and scope. Restrictions may be sector-specific (e.g., healthcare, finance, law enforcement), context-dependent (e.g., high-stakes decision-making, interaction with vulnerable populations), or capability-based (e.g., systems with certain levels of autonomy or learning abilities). Research focuses on developing frameworks to categorize AI systems and their use cases in ways that enable meaningful but practical restrictions.

Current work explores methods for implementing and enforcing restrictions effectively, including technical measures like capability limitations, operational constraints such as human oversight requirements, and environmental controls that restrict deployment contexts. There is particular emphasis on designing restrictions that remain robust as systems evolve and adapt, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to accommodate legitimate uses and technological advancement.
