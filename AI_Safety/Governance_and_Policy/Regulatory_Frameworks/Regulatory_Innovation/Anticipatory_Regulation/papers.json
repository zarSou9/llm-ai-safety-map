    "title": "Regulator-Manufacturer AI Agents Modeling: Mathematical Feedback-Driven Multi-Agent LLM Framework",
    "published_date": "2024-11-22",
    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of regulatory updates from global authorities presents significant challenges for medical device manufacturers, necessitating agile strategies to sustain compliance and maintain market access. Concurrently, regulatory bodies must effectively monitor manufacturers' responses and develop strategic surveillance plans. This study employs a multi-agent modeling approach, enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), to simulate regulatory dynamics and examine the adaptive behaviors of key actors, including regulatory bodies, manufacturers, and competitors. These agents operate within a simulated environment governed by regulatory flow theory, capturing the impacts of regulatory changes on compliance decisions, market adaptation, and innovation strategies. Our findings illuminate the influence of regulatory shifts on industry behaviour and identify strategic opportunities for improving regulatory practices, optimizing compliance, and fostering innovation. By leveraging the integration of multi-agent systems and LLMs, this research provides a novel perspective and offers actionable insights for stakeholders navigating the evolving regulatory landscape of the medical device industry.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a novel multi-agent system, enhanced by Large Language Models, to simulate the interactions between medical device manufacturers and regulatory bodies, analyzing the impact of regulatory changes on compliance, market behavior, and innovation. The model uses regulatory flow theory to inform agent decision-making and offers insights for improving regulatory practices and fostering industry compliance."

    "title": "Developing new technologies to protect ecosystems: planning with adaptive management",
    "abstract": "Technology development is an essential investment for policymakers to address contemporary global crises, including climate change, biodiversity loss, the energy transition, and emergent infectious diseases. However, investing limited resources in the development of new technologies is risky. The research and development process is unpredictable, with unknown timelines and outcomes. In addition, even after successful development, the effects of deploying a new technology remain uncertain. When confronted with these uncertainties, policymakers must determine how long they should allocate resources to developing new technologies. Informed decisions require anticipating possible successes and failures of both technology development and deployment, which is a challenging optimisation task when managing dynamic systems, such as threatened ecological systems. Using an adaptive management approach from Artificial Intelligence, we discover a time limit new technologies should be developed for, which balances costs, benefits, and uncertainties during development and deployment. We extract clear and transparent general rules for investing in new technologies, building on an analytical approximation. Using Australia's Great Barrier Reef as a case study, we demonstrate how characteristics of the managed system influence the optimal investment strategy. Our approach can inform the development of new technologies in multiple domains including biodiversity conservation, public health, energy production, and the technology industry more broadly. Significance Technology development is essential to address the crises our world faces, such as ecosystem collapse. With limited resources, policymakers must decide whether to invest in developing new technologies and, if ever, when to stop. Informed decisions require anticipating possible failures of both technology development and deployment, a challenging task when dealing with changing systems. Using an Artificial Intelligence approach, we find a time limit for technology development that depends on characteristics of the managed ecosystem. This work can guide technology investments in many domains such as biodiversity conservation, epidemiology, energy production and the technology industry more broadly.",

    "title": "Robust Technology Regulation",
    "published_date": "2024-08-30",
    "abstract": "We analyze how uncertain technologies should be robustly regulated. An agent develops a new technology and, while privately learning about its harms and benefits, continually chooses whether to continue development. A principal, uncertain about what the agent might learn, chooses among dynamic mechanisms (e.g., paths of taxes or subsidies) to influence the agent's choices in different states. We show that learning robust mechanisms -- those which deliver the highest payoff guarantee across all learning processes -- are simple and resemble `regulatory sandboxes' consisting of zero marginal tax on R&D which keeps the agent maximally sensitive to new information up to a hard quota, upon which the agent turns maximally insensitive. Robustness is important: we characterize the worst-case learning process under non-robust mechanisms and show that they induce growing but weak optimism which can deliver unboundedly poor principal payoffs; hard quotas safeguard against this. If the regulator also learns, adaptive hard quotas are robustly optimal which highlights the importance of expertise in regulation.",
    "summary": "This paper analyzes optimal dynamic regulation of uncertain technologies, finding that robust mechanisms, maximizing worst-case payoffs, resemble \"regulatory sandboxes\" with initial zero marginal taxes on R&D followed by a hard quota. Robustness is crucial to prevent unboundedly poor outcomes from overly optimistic agents and, when regulators also learn, adaptive hard quotas become optimal."

    "title": "Regulatory Markets: The Future of AI Governance",
    "published_date": "2023-04-11",
    "abstract": "Appropriately regulating artificial intelligence is an increasingly urgent policy challenge. Legislatures and regulators lack the specialized knowledge required to best translate public demands into legal requirements. Overreliance on industry self-regulation fails to hold producers and users of AI systems accountable to democratic demands. Regulatory markets, in which governments require the targets of regulation to purchase regulatory services from a private regulator, are proposed. This approach to AI regulation could overcome the limitations of both command-and-control regulation and self-regulation. Regulatory market could enable governments to establish policy priorities for the regulation of AI, whilst relying on market forces and industry R&D efforts to pioneer the methods of regulation that best achieve policymakers' stated objectives.",
    "citation_count": 21,
    "summary": "The paper proposes regulatory markets, where governments contract private firms to regulate AI, as a solution to the limitations of traditional command-and-control and self-regulation approaches. This model leverages market forces and industry expertise to achieve policy goals while addressing the knowledge gap in AI regulation."

    "title": "Frontier AI Regulation: Managing Emerging Risks to Public Safety",
    "published_date": "2023-07-06",
    "abstract": "Advanced AI models hold the promise of tremendous benefits for humanity, but society needs to proactively manage the accompanying risks. In this paper, we focus on what we term\"frontier AI\"models: highly capable foundation models that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety. Frontier AI models pose a distinct regulatory challenge: dangerous capabilities can arise unexpectedly; it is difficult to robustly prevent a deployed model from being misused; and, it is difficult to stop a model's capabilities from proliferating broadly. To address these challenges, at least three building blocks for the regulation of frontier models are needed: (1) standard-setting processes to identify appropriate requirements for frontier AI developers, (2) registration and reporting requirements to provide regulators with visibility into frontier AI development processes, and (3) mechanisms to ensure compliance with safety standards for the development and deployment of frontier AI models. Industry self-regulation is an important first step. However, wider societal discussions and government intervention will be needed to create standards and to ensure compliance with them. We consider several options to this end, including granting enforcement powers to supervisory authorities and licensure regimes for frontier AI models. Finally, we propose an initial set of safety standards. These include conducting pre-deployment risk assessments; external scrutiny of model behavior; using risk assessments to inform deployment decisions; and monitoring and responding to new information about model capabilities and uses post-deployment. We hope this discussion contributes to the broader conversation on how to balance public safety risks and innovation benefits from advances at the frontier of AI development.",
    "citation_count": 91,
    "summary": "This paper argues that highly capable \"frontier\" AI models pose significant public safety risks requiring proactive regulation. The authors propose a three-pronged regulatory approach encompassing standard-setting, registration/reporting, and compliance mechanisms, advocating for a combination of industry self-regulation and government oversight to mitigate these risks."

    "title": "Dual Governance: The intersection of centralized regulation and crowdsourced safety mechanisms for Generative AI",
    "published_date": "2023-08-02",
    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen mainstream adoption lately, especially in the form of consumer-facing, open-ended, text and image generating models. However, the use of such systems raises significant ethical and safety concerns, including privacy violations, misinformation and intellectual property theft. The potential for generative AI to displace human creativity and livelihoods has also been under intense scrutiny. To mitigate these risks, there is an urgent need of policies and regulations responsible and ethical development in the field of generative AI. Existing and proposed centralized regulations by governments to rein in AI face criticisms such as not having sufficient clarity or uniformity, lack of interoperability across lines of jurisdictions, restricting innovation, and hindering free market competition. Decentralized protections via crowdsourced safety tools and mechanisms are a potential alternative. However, they have clear deficiencies in terms of lack of adequacy of oversight and difficulty of enforcement of ethical and safety standards, and are thus not enough by themselves as a regulation mechanism. We propose a marriage of these two strategies via a framework we call Dual Governance. This framework proposes a cooperative synergy between centralized government regulations in a U.S. specific context and safety mechanisms developed by the community to protect stakeholders from the harms of generative AI. By implementing the Dual Governance framework, we posit that innovation and creativity can be promoted while ensuring safe and ethical deployment of generative AI.",
    "citation_count": 3,
    "summary": "This paper proposes a \"Dual Governance\" framework for generative AI safety, combining centralized government regulations with decentralized, crowdsourced safety mechanisms to mitigate ethical risks while fostering innovation. This approach aims to address the limitations of solely centralized or decentralized approaches."

    "title": "Regulating trusted autonomous systems in Australia",
    "published_date": "2023-02-07",
    "abstract": "Australia is a leader in autonomous systems technology, particularly in the mining industry, borne from necessity in a geographically dispersed and complex natural environment. Increasingly advanced autonomous systems are becoming more prevalent in Australia, particularly as the safety, environmental and efficiency benefits become better understood, and the increasing sophistication of technology improves capability and availability. Increasing use of these systems, including in the maritime domain and air domain, is placing pressure on the national safety regulators, who must either continue to apply their traditional regulatory approach requiring exemptions to enable operation of emerging technology, or seize the opportunity to put in place an agile and adaptive approach better suited to the rapid developments of the twenty first century. In Australia the key national safety regulators have demonstrated an appetite for working with industry to facilitate innovation, but their limited resources mean progress is slow. There is a critical role to be played by third parties from industry, government, and academia who can work together to develop, test and publish new assurance and accreditation frameworks for trusted autonomous systems, and assist in the transition to an adaptive and agile regulatory philosophy. This is necessary to ensure the benefits of autonomous systems can be realised, without compromising safety. This paper will identify the growing use cases for autonomous systems in Australia, in the maritime, air and land domains, assess the current regulatory framework, argue that Australia's regulatory approach needs to become more agile and anticipatory, and investigate how third party projects could positively impact the assurance and accreditation process for autonomous systems in the future.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "Australia's increasing adoption of autonomous systems, particularly in mining, necessitates a shift from its traditional, resource-constrained regulatory approach to a more agile and anticipatory framework, leveraging collaboration between industry, government, and academia to ensure safe and efficient implementation."
