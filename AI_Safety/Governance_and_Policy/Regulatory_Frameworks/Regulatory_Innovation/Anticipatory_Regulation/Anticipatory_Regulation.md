### Mini Description

Development of forward-looking regulatory approaches that can preemptively address potential risks and challenges before they materialize, including scenario planning and impact assessment methodologies.

### Description

Anticipatory regulation focuses on developing proactive regulatory approaches that can identify, assess, and address potential risks and challenges in AI systems before they materialize. This field combines insights from futures studies, risk assessment, and systems thinking to create frameworks that help regulators stay ahead of technological developments rather than responding reactively to problems after they emerge.

A key challenge in anticipatory regulation is balancing the need to address potential risks with the inherent uncertainty in predicting technological development paths. Researchers explore methodologies for systematic horizon scanning, scenario analysis, and impact assessment that can inform regulatory design while remaining adaptable to different potential futures. This includes developing frameworks for identifying early warning signals of emerging risks and establishing triggers for regulatory intervention based on capability thresholds.

Current research emphasizes the development of robust decision-making frameworks that can guide regulatory action under uncertainty, including methods for incorporating expert forecasting, modeling complex system interactions, and evaluating potential intervention points. There is particular focus on creating governance mechanisms that can effectively respond to discontinuous technological progress and handle the challenges posed by transformative AI capabilities before they are fully realized.
