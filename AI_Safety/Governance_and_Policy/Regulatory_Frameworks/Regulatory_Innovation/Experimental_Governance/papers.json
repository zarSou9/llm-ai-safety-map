    "title": "Trust AI Regulation? Discerning users are vital to build trust and effective AI regulation",
    "published_date": "2024-03-14",
    "abstract": "There is general agreement that some form of regulation is necessary both for AI creators to be incentivised to develop trustworthy systems, and for users to actually trust those systems. But there is much debate about what form these regulations should take and how they should be implemented. Most work in this area has been qualitative, and has not been able to make formal predictions. Here, we propose that evolutionary game theory can be used to quantitatively model the dilemmas faced by users, AI creators, and regulators, and provide insights into the possible effects of different regulatory regimes. We show that creating trustworthy AI and user trust requires regulators to be incentivised to regulate effectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of two mechanisms that can achieve this. The first is where governments can recognise and reward regulators that do a good job. In that case, if the AI system is not too risky for users then some level of trustworthy development and user trust evolves. We then consider an alternative solution, where users can condition their trust decision on the effectiveness of the regulators. This leads to effective regulation, and consequently the development of trustworthy AI and user trust, provided that the cost of implementing regulations is not too high. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the effect of different regulatory regimes from an evolutionary game theoretic perspective.",

    "summary": "This paper uses evolutionary game theory to model the interaction between AI creators, users, and regulators, demonstrating that effective AI regulation and user trust require incentivizing regulators, either through government rewards or user-conditional trust. The model shows that trustworthy AI development and user trust emerge when regulatory costs are manageable and regulators are effectively incentivized."

    "title": "Regulator-Manufacturer AI Agents Modeling: Mathematical Feedback-Driven Multi-Agent LLM Framework",
    "published_date": "2024-11-22",
    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of regulatory updates from global authorities presents significant challenges for medical device manufacturers, necessitating agile strategies to sustain compliance and maintain market access. Concurrently, regulatory bodies must effectively monitor manufacturers' responses and develop strategic surveillance plans. This study employs a multi-agent modeling approach, enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), to simulate regulatory dynamics and examine the adaptive behaviors of key actors, including regulatory bodies, manufacturers, and competitors. These agents operate within a simulated environment governed by regulatory flow theory, capturing the impacts of regulatory changes on compliance decisions, market adaptation, and innovation strategies. Our findings illuminate the influence of regulatory shifts on industry behaviour and identify strategic opportunities for improving regulatory practices, optimizing compliance, and fostering innovation. By leveraging the integration of multi-agent systems and LLMs, this research provides a novel perspective and offers actionable insights for stakeholders navigating the evolving regulatory landscape of the medical device industry.",
    "summary": "This paper uses a multi-agent system enhanced by Large Language Models to simulate the interaction between medical device manufacturers and regulatory bodies, modeling the impact of regulatory changes on compliance, market adaptation, and innovation. The model offers insights into optimizing regulatory practices and fostering innovation within the medical device industry."

    "title": "Robust Technology Regulation",
    "published_date": "2024-08-30",
    "abstract": "We analyze how uncertain technologies should be robustly regulated. An agent develops a new technology and, while privately learning about its harms and benefits, continually chooses whether to continue development. A principal, uncertain about what the agent might learn, chooses among dynamic mechanisms (e.g., paths of taxes or subsidies) to influence the agent's choices in different states. We show that learning robust mechanisms -- those which deliver the highest payoff guarantee across all learning processes -- are simple and resemble `regulatory sandboxes' consisting of zero marginal tax on R&D which keeps the agent maximally sensitive to new information up to a hard quota, upon which the agent turns maximally insensitive. Robustness is important: we characterize the worst-case learning process under non-robust mechanisms and show that they induce growing but weak optimism which can deliver unboundedly poor principal payoffs; hard quotas safeguard against this. If the regulator also learns, adaptive hard quotas are robustly optimal which highlights the importance of expertise in regulation.",
    "summary": "The paper analyzes optimal dynamic regulation of uncertain technologies, finding that robust mechanisms resemble \"regulatory sandboxes\" with initial zero marginal taxes on R&D followed by a hard quota, maximizing responsiveness to information until a safety threshold is reached. Robustness is crucial to avoid worst-case learning scenarios that induce excessive optimism and poor outcomes for the regulator."

    "published_date": "2024-03-22",
    "summary": "This article, part of a series reviewing the 2024 AI regulatory landscape, focuses on AI model registriesâ€”centralized databases tracking AI systems for governance purposes. These registries, drawing parallels from pharmaceutical regulations, vary widely in requirements and accessibility across jurisdictions like the US, EU, and China, enabling governments to regulate AI models directly rather than entire companies or use cases."

    "title": "Dual Governance: The intersection of centralized regulation and crowdsourced safety mechanisms for Generative AI",
    "published_date": "2023-08-02",
    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen mainstream adoption lately, especially in the form of consumer-facing, open-ended, text and image generating models. However, the use of such systems raises significant ethical and safety concerns, including privacy violations, misinformation and intellectual property theft. The potential for generative AI to displace human creativity and livelihoods has also been under intense scrutiny. To mitigate these risks, there is an urgent need of policies and regulations responsible and ethical development in the field of generative AI. Existing and proposed centralized regulations by governments to rein in AI face criticisms such as not having sufficient clarity or uniformity, lack of interoperability across lines of jurisdictions, restricting innovation, and hindering free market competition. Decentralized protections via crowdsourced safety tools and mechanisms are a potential alternative. However, they have clear deficiencies in terms of lack of adequacy of oversight and difficulty of enforcement of ethical and safety standards, and are thus not enough by themselves as a regulation mechanism. We propose a marriage of these two strategies via a framework we call Dual Governance. This framework proposes a cooperative synergy between centralized government regulations in a U.S. specific context and safety mechanisms developed by the community to protect stakeholders from the harms of generative AI. By implementing the Dual Governance framework, we posit that innovation and creativity can be promoted while ensuring safe and ethical deployment of generative AI.",
    "citation_count": 3,
    "summary": "The paper proposes \"Dual Governance\" for generative AI, a framework combining centralized government regulation with crowdsourced safety mechanisms to mitigate ethical and safety risks while fostering innovation. This approach aims to address the shortcomings of solely relying on either centralized or decentralized control."

    "title": "Regulatory Markets: The Future of AI Governance",
    "published_date": "2023-04-11",
    "abstract": "Appropriately regulating artificial intelligence is an increasingly urgent policy challenge. Legislatures and regulators lack the specialized knowledge required to best translate public demands into legal requirements. Overreliance on industry self-regulation fails to hold producers and users of AI systems accountable to democratic demands. Regulatory markets, in which governments require the targets of regulation to purchase regulatory services from a private regulator, are proposed. This approach to AI regulation could overcome the limitations of both command-and-control regulation and self-regulation. Regulatory market could enable governments to establish policy priorities for the regulation of AI, whilst relying on market forces and industry R&D efforts to pioneer the methods of regulation that best achieve policymakers' stated objectives.",
    "citation_count": 21,
    "summary": "This paper argues that regulatory markets, where governments contract private entities to perform AI regulation, offer a superior alternative to traditional command-and-control or self-regulatory approaches. This approach leverages market forces and industry expertise to achieve policy goals while addressing limitations of existing methods."
