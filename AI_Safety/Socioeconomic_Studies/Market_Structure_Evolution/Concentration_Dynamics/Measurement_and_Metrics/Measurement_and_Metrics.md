### Mini Description

Development and application of quantitative methods to measure and track AI-driven market concentration across different industries and timeframes

### Description

Measurement and Metrics in AI market concentration focuses on developing and implementing quantitative frameworks to assess how artificial intelligence technologies affect market structure and competition. This involves creating new metrics that can capture the unique aspects of AI-driven markets, such as data advantages, algorithmic capabilities, and network effects, while adapting traditional economic concentration measures like the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) to account for these novel dynamics.

A key challenge lies in defining appropriate market boundaries and units of measurement in AI-intensive industries, where traditional product-based or geographic market definitions may not adequately capture competitive relationships. Researchers must develop methods to quantify intangible assets like data quality, AI model performance, and network effects, while accounting for the rapid pace of technological change and the potential for sudden market disruptions through algorithmic breakthroughs.

The field emphasizes developing both leading and lagging indicators of market concentration, combining traditional financial metrics with novel technical measurements such as model performance benchmarks, data acquisition rates, and computational resource utilization. This includes creating frameworks for assessing potential future concentration based on current technological trajectories and developing early warning systems for emerging monopolistic tendencies. Special attention is paid to ensuring metrics are robust across different market contexts and technological paradigms while remaining practical for regulatory application.
