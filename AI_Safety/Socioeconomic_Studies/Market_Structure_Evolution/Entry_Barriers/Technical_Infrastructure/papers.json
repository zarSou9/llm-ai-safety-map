    "title": "Technological Shocks and Algorithmic Decision Aids in Credence Goods Markets",
    "published_date": "2024-01-31",
    "abstract": "In credence goods markets such as health care or repair services, consumers rely on experts with superior information to adequately diagnose and treat them. Experts, however, are constrained in their diagnostic abilities, which hurts market efficiency and consumer welfare. Technological breakthroughs that substitute or complement expert judgments have the potential to alleviate consumer mistreatment. This article studies how competitive experts adopt novel diagnostic technologies when skills are heterogeneously distributed and obfuscated to consumers. We differentiate between novel technologies that increase expert abilities, and algorithmic decision aids that complement expert judgments, but do not affect an expert's personal diagnostic precision. We show that high-ability experts may be incentivized to forego the decision aid in order to escape a pooling equilibrium by differentiating themselves from low-ability experts. Results from an online experiment support our hypothesis, showing that high-ability experts are significantly less likely than low-ability experts to invest into an algorithmic decision aid. Furthermore, we document pervasive under-investments, and no effect on expert honesty.",
    "summary": "This paper examines how experts in credence goods markets adopt new diagnostic technologies, finding that high-ability experts may avoid algorithmic decision aids to differentiate themselves from low-ability experts, leading to under-investment in these technologies despite potential benefits. The study's online experiment supports this hypothesis, revealing no impact on expert honesty."

    "title": "From catch-up to frontier: The utility model as a learning device to escape the middle-income trap",
    "published_date": "2024-08-26",
    "abstract": "Escaping the middle-income trap requires a country to develop indigenous technological capabilities for high value-added innovation. This study examines the role of second-tier patent systems, known as utility models (UMs), in promoting such capability acquisition in less developed countries. UMs are designed to incentivize incremental and adaptive innovation through lower novelty standards than patents, but their long-term impact on the capability acquisition process remains underexplored. Using South Korea as a case study and drawing on the characteristics of technological regimes in catching-up economies, we present three key findings: First, the country's post-catch-up frontier technologies (U.S. patents) are more impactful (highly cited) when they build on Korean domestic UMs. This suggests that UM-based imitative and adaptive learning laid the foundation for the country's globally competitive capabilities. Second, the impact of UM-based learning diminishes as the country's economy develops. Third, frontier technologies rooted in UMs contribute more to the country's own specialization than to follow-on innovations by foreign actors, compared to technologies without UM linkages. We discuss how technological regimes and industrial policies in catching-up economies interact with the UM system to bridge the catching-up (imitation- and adaptation-based) and post-catching-up (specialization- and creativity-based) phases.",
    "summary": "This study uses South Korea as a case study to demonstrate that utility models (UMs), a type of patent system, facilitated the country's technological advancement by fostering imitative and adaptive learning, ultimately supporting its transition from a catching-up to a frontier economy; however, the impact of UMs diminishes as economic development progresses."

    "title": "Making intellectual property rights work for climate technology transfer and innovation in developing countries",
    "published_date": "2024-08-22",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the controversial role of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) in climate technology transfer and innovation in developing countries. Using a systematic literature review and expert interviews, we assess the role of IPRs on three sources of climate technology: (1) international technology transfer, (2) adaptive innovation, and (3) indigenous innovation. Our contributions are threefold. First, patents have limited impact in any of these channels, suggesting that current debates over IPRs may be directed towards the wrong targets. Second, trademarks and utility models provide incentives for climate innovation in the countries studied. Third, drawing from the results, we develop a framework to guide policy on how IPRs can work better in the broader context of climate and trade policies, outlining distinct mechanisms to support mitigation and adaptation. Our results indicate that market mechanisms, especially trade and demand-pull policies, should be prioritised for mitigation solutions. Adaptation differs, relying more on indigenous innovation due to local needs and low demand. Institutional mechanisms, such as finance and co-development, should be prioritised to build innovation capacities for adaptation.",
    "summary": "This study finds that patents have limited impact on climate technology transfer and innovation in developing countries, while trademarks and utility models offer greater incentives; it proposes a policy framework prioritizing market mechanisms for mitigation and institutional support for adaptation-focused indigenous innovation."

    "title": "The Gatekeeper Effect: The Implications of Pre-Screening, Self-selection, and Bias for Hiring Processes",
    "published_date": "2023-12-28",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of screening in decision-making processes under uncertainty, while focusing on the impact of adding an additional screening stage, commonly known as a “gatekeeper.” Although our main analysis is rooted in the context of job market hiring, the principles and findings are broadly applicable to areas such as educational admissions, patient healthcare selection, and financial loan approvals. The gatekeeper's role is to assess applicant suitability before significant costs are incurred. Our study reveals that although gatekeepers are designed to streamline selection processes by filtering out the candidates who are less likely to be selected, sometimes they inadvertently affect the candidate's own decision-making process. We explore the conditions under which the introduction of a gatekeeper can enhance or impede the efficiency of these processes. Additionally, we consider how gatekeeping strategies can be adapted to influence the accuracy of selection decisions. Our research also extends to scenarios in which gatekeeping is influenced by historical biases, particularly in competitive settings like hiring. We discover that candidates confronted with a statistically biased gatekeeping process are more likely to withdraw from the job application process, thereby perpetuating the previously mentioned historical biases. The study suggests that measures such as affirmative action can effectively address these biases. Although centered on hiring, the insights and methodologies from our study have significant implications for a wide range of fields to which screening and gatekeeping are integral.

    "title": "Understanding Barriers to Internal Startups in Large Organizations: Evidence from a Globally Distributed Company",
    "published_date": "2021-03-17",
    "abstract": "Large global companies need to speed up their innovation activities to increase competitive advantage. However, such companies' organizational structures impede their ability to capture trends they are well aware of due to bureaucracy, slow decision-making, distributed departments, and distributed processes. One way to strengthen the innovation capability is through fostering internal startups. We report findings from an embedded multiple-case study of five internal startups in a globally distributed company to identify barriers for software product innovation: late involvement of software developers, executive sponsor is missing or not clarified, yearly budgeting and planning, unclear decision-making authority, lack of digital infrastructure for experimentation and access to data from external actors. Drawing on the framework of continuous software engineering proposed by Fitzgerald and Stol, we discuss the role of BizDev in software product innovation. We suggest that lack of continuity, rather than the lack of speed, is an ultimate challenge for internal startups in large global companies.",

    "summary": "A case study of five internal startups within a large, global company reveals that bureaucratic hurdles, including late developer involvement, unclear leadership, inflexible budgeting, and insufficient digital infrastructure, hinder software innovation more than a lack of speed. The study emphasizes the critical need for continuous software engineering practices and clarified business development roles to overcome these challenges."
