    "title": "Platform Design in Curated Dating Markets",
    "published_date": "2023-08-03",
    "abstract": "Motivated by online dating apps, we study how to select subset of profiles to show to each user in each period in a two-sided matching platform. Users on each side observe the profiles set by the platform and decide which of them to like. A match occurs if and only if two users mutually like each other, potentially in different periods. The goal of the platform is to maximize the total expected number of matches. We study different platform designs, varying (i) how users interact with each other, i.e., whether one or both sides of the market can initiate an interaction, and (ii) the timing of matches, i.e., whether the platform allows non-sequential matches in addition to sequential ones. We focus on the case with two periods and study the performance of different approaches. First, we show that algorithms that exploit the submodularity of the problem and properties of its feasible region can achieve constant factor approximation guarantees that depend on the platform design, ranging from $1-1/e$ to $1/3$. Finally, we show that the Dating Heuristic (DH) (Rios et al., 2023), which is commonly used and achieves good performance in practice, provides an approximation guarantee of $1-1/e$ for all platform designs. We show theoretically and empirically that the performance of the DH is robust to the platform design. Our simulation results -- using real data from our industry partner -- also show that platforms using a one-directional design should initiate interactions with the side that leads to the smallest expected backlog per profile displayed, balancing size and selectivity. Moreover, we find that a one-directional design can lead to at least half of the matches obtained with a two-directional design. Finally, our results show that avoiding non-sequential matches has no sizable effect, regardless of the platform design.",
    "summary": "This paper analyzes optimal profile selection algorithms for two-sided curated dating platforms, considering variations in user interaction and match timing. The authors provide approximation guarantees for different algorithms and demonstrate the robustness and practical effectiveness of a commonly used heuristic, suggesting one-directional designs can be surprisingly efficient."

    "title": "Data, Competition, and Digital Platforms",
    "published_date": "2023-04-15",
    "abstract": "A monopolist platform uses data to match heterogeneous consumers with multiproduct sellers. The consumers can purchase the products on the platform or search off the platform. The platform sells targeted ads to sellers that recommend their products to consumers and reveals information to consumers about their match values. The revenue-optimal mechanism is a managed advertising campaign that matches products and preferences efficiently. In equilibrium, sellers offer higher qualities at lower unit prices on than off platform. The platform exploits its information advantage to increase its bargaining power vis-Ã -vis the sellers. Finally, privacy-respecting data-governance rules can lead to welfare gains for consumers. (JEL D11, D42, D44, D82, D83, M37)",

    "summary": "A monopolist digital platform uses data to improve consumer-seller matching, resulting in higher seller quality and lower prices on the platform compared to off-platform options, but this advantage allows the platform to exploit its bargaining power with sellers. Privacy-respecting regulations can surprisingly improve consumer welfare."

    "title": "Managing Congestion in Two-Sided Platforms: The Case of Online Rentals",
    "published_date": "2023-08-28",
    "abstract": "Thick two-sided matching platforms, such as the room-rental market, face the challenge of showing relevant objects to users to reduce search costs. Many platforms use ranking algorithms to determine the order in which alternatives are shown to users. Ranking algorithms may depend on simple criteria, such as how long a listing has been on the platform, or incorporate more sophisticated aspects, such as personalized inferences about users' preferences. Using rich data on a room rental platform, we show how ranking algorithms can be a source of unnecessary congestion, especially when the ranking is invariant across users. Invariant rankings induce users to view, click, and request the same rooms in the platform we study, greatly limiting the number of matches it creates. We estimate preferences and simulate counterfactuals under different ranking algorithms varying the degree of user personalization and variation across users. In our case, increased personalization raises both user match utility and congestion, which leads to a trade-off. We find that the current outcome is inefficient as it lies below the possibility frontier, and propose alternatives that improve upon it.",
    "summary": "Online room rental platforms using non-personalized ranking algorithms suffer from significant congestion as users compete for the same top-ranked listings, reducing overall matches; personalizing rankings improves user satisfaction but increases congestion, requiring a careful balance to optimize platform efficiency."

    "title": "Learn to Match with No Regret: Reinforcement Learning in Markov Matching Markets",
    "published_date": "2022-03-07",
    "abstract": "We study a Markov matching market involving a planner and a set of strategic agents on the two sides of the market. At each step, the agents are presented with a dynamical context, where the contexts determine the utilities. The planner controls the transition of the contexts to maximize the cumulative social welfare, while the agents aim to find a myopic stable matching at each step. Such a setting captures a range of applications including ridesharing platforms. We formalize the problem by proposing a reinforcement learning framework that integrates optimistic value iteration with maximum weight matching. The proposed algorithm addresses the coupled challenges of sequential exploration, matching stability, and function approximation. We prove that the algorithm achieves sublinear regret.",

    "title": "Rawlsian Fairness in Online Bipartite Matching: Two-sided, Group, and Individual",
    "published_date": "2022-01-16",
    "abstract": "Online bipartite-matching platforms are ubiquitous and find applications in important areas such as crowdsourcing and ridesharing. In the most general form, the platform consists of three entities: two sides to be matched and a platform operator that decides the matching. The design of algorithms for such platforms has traditionally focused on the operator's (expected) profit. Since fairness has become an important consideration that was ignored in the existing algorithms a collection of online matching algorithms have been developed that give a fair treatment guarantee for one side of the market at the expense of a drop in the operator's profit. In this paper, we generalize the existing work to offer fair treatment guarantees to both sides of the market simultaneously, at a calculated worst case drop to operator profit. We consider group and individual Rawlsian fairness criteria. Moreover, our algorithms have theoretical guarantees and have adjustable parameters that can be tuned as desired to balance the trade-off between the utilities of the three sides. We also derive hardness results that give clear upper bounds over the performance of any algorithm.",

    "summary": "This paper presents online bipartite matching algorithms that guarantee Rawlsian fairness for both sides of the market simultaneously, unlike prior work focusing solely on one side, while quantifying the resulting worst-case loss in operator profit. The algorithms offer adjustable parameters to balance fairness and profit, supported by theoretical guarantees and hardness results."

    "title": "Equitable Marketplace Mechanism Design",
    "published_date": "2022-09-22",
    "abstract": "We consider a trading marketplace that is populated by traders with diverse trading strategies and objectives. The marketplace allows the suppliers to list their goods and facilitates matching between buyers and sellers. In return, such a marketplace typically charges fees for facilitating trade. The goal of this work is to design a dynamic fee schedule for the marketplace that is equitable and profitable to all traders while being profitable to the marketplace at the same time (from charging fees). Since the traders adapt their strategies to the fee schedule, we present a reinforcement learning framework for simultaneously learning a marketplace fee schedule and trading strategies that adapt to this fee schedule using a weighted optimization objective of profits and equitability. We illustrate the use of the proposed approach in detail on a simulated stock exchange with different types of investors, specifically market makers and consumer investors. As we vary the equitability weights across different investor classes, we see that the learnt exchange fee schedule starts favoring the class of investors with the highest weight. We further discuss the observed insights from the simulated stock exchange in light of the general framework of equitable marketplace mechanism design.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for designing equitable and profitable dynamic fee schedules in trading marketplaces, simultaneously optimizing for trader profits and marketplace revenue while considering diverse trader strategies. The approach is demonstrated on a simulated stock exchange, showing how fee schedules adapt to prioritize investor classes based on assigned equitability weights."

    "title": "Learning Equilibria in Matching Markets from Bandit Feedback",
    "published_date": "2021-08-19",
    "abstract": "Large-scale, two-sided matching platforms must find market outcomes that align with user preferences while simultaneously learning these preferences from data. Classical notions of stability (Gale and Shapley, 1962; Shapley and Shubik, 1971) are unfortunately of limited value in the learning setting, given that preferences are inherently uncertain and destabilizing while they are being learned. To bridge this gap, we develop a framework and algorithms for learning stable market outcomes under uncertainty. Our primary setting is matching with transferable utilities, where the platform both matches agents and sets monetary transfers between them. We design an incentive-aware learning objective that captures the distance of a market outcome from equilibrium. Using this objective, we analyze the complexity of learning as a function of preference structure, casting learning as a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. Algorithmically, we show that\"optimism in the face of uncertainty,\"the principle underlying many bandit algorithms, applies to a primal-dual formulation of matching with transfers and leads to near-optimal regret bounds. Our work takes a first step toward elucidating when and how stable matchings arise in large, data-driven marketplaces.",

    "title": "Designing Approximately Optimal Search on Matching Platforms",
    "abstract": "We study the design of a decentralized two-sided matching market in which agents' search is guided by the platform. Each agent is of one of finitely many types and has (potentially random) preferences drawn from known type-specific distributions. Equipped with such distributional knowledge, the platform guides the search process by determining the meeting rate between each pair of types from the two sides. Meanwhile, agents strategically accept or reject the potential partners whom they meet. Focusing on when agents have symmetric pairwise preferences in a continuum model, we first characterize the unique stationary equilibrium that arises given a feasible set of meeting rates. We then introduce the platform's optimal directed search problem, which involves optimizing meeting rates to maximize equilibrium social welfare. We show that incentive issues arising from congestion and cannibalization make the design problem fairly intricate. Nonetheless, we develop an efficiently computable solution whose corresponding equilibrium achieves at least 1/4 of the optimal social welfare. Our directed search design is simple and easy-to-implement, as its corresponding bipartite graph consists of disjoint stars. Furthermore, our solution implies that, with careful search design, the platform can substantially limit choice and yet induce an equilibrium with approximately optimal welfare. Finally, we show that approximation is likely the best we can hope for by establishing that the problem of designing optimal directed search is NP-hard to approximate beyond a certain constant factor.",
