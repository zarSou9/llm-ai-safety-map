### Mini Description

Study of how AI platforms optimize matching, pricing, and interaction rules across different user groups to create and capture value

### Description

Multi-sided Market Design in AI-driven platforms focuses on optimizing the complex interactions and value exchanges between different user groups through algorithmic mechanisms. This involves designing matching algorithms, pricing structures, and interaction rules that maximize platform efficiency while ensuring fairness and sustainability. The challenge lies in balancing competing interests across user groups while accounting for the dynamic nature of AI-enhanced matching and the potential for unintended feedback loops.

A key aspect is the development of AI mechanisms that can adaptively optimize market clearing, taking into account both short-term efficiency and long-term platform health. This includes designing recommendation systems that match supply and demand effectively, implementing dynamic pricing strategies that respond to market conditions, and creating incentive structures that encourage beneficial participant behaviors. Researchers must consider how AI can be leveraged to reduce information asymmetries, minimize transaction costs, and enhance market liquidity.

The field also grapples with unique challenges posed by AI's capability to personalize and automate market interactions at scale. This includes addressing questions of manipulation resistance, ensuring transparency in algorithmic decision-making, and managing the tension between optimization for individual transactions versus system-wide outcomes. Particular attention is paid to designing mechanisms that remain robust as AI systems evolve and become more sophisticated in their ability to learn from and respond to market participants.
