    "title": "Strategic Investments for Platform Launch and Ecosystem Growth: A Dynamic Analysis",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Multi-sided platforms must make decisions on both pricing and engineering investment and must continually adjust them as the platform scales over its lifecycle. Engineering investments can be allocated to features that improve a platform's standalone value, social features to take advantage of same-side network effects, or integration tools and boundary resources to facilitate third-party content creation. Guidance in the academic or practitioner literature is not granular. Moreover, relevant normative economic models that consider externalities are rarely dynamic. Hence, there is a gap in knowledge about how to best balance tradeoffs between different strategic decisions throughout the entire platform lifecycle. To begin to address this gap, we explore normative strategies for coordinating pricing and engineering investment decisions on a continuous basis under different ecosystem conditions. We build a simulation model informed by economics and marketing theory and perform extensive sensitivity analyses on key parameters in different ecosystem scenarios over a multi-period lifecycle. We find that pricing and investment strategies must continuously change to perform optimally. In particular, strategies that are most effective at launch often differ from those that are most effective during scaling as well as those most effective at maturity. We also find that the optimal strategy depends strongly on the monetization model and market aversion to price changes. Lastly, we specifically examine four different industry segments: mobile platforms, social media, the sharing economy, and business-to-business. The results provide evidence that the trajectory of platform pricing and investment strategies should greatly differ depending on industrial context.",

    "summary": "This paper uses a dynamic simulation model to analyze optimal pricing and engineering investment strategies for multi-sided platforms throughout their lifecycle, finding that optimal strategies vary significantly depending on platform stage, monetization model, market conditions, and industry sector. The research highlights the need for continuous adaptation of strategies rather than a static approach."

    "title": "Incentives and Coevolution: Steering Linear Dynamical Systems With Noncooperative Agents",
    "published_date": "2023-03-13",
    "abstract": "Modern sociotechnical systems typically consist of many interconnected users and competing service providers, where notions like market equilibrium are tightly connected to the “evolution” of the network of users. In this article, we model the users' dynamics as a linear dynamical system and the service providers as agents taking part in a generalized Nash game, whose outcome coincides with the input of the users' dynamics. We thus characterize the notion of coevolution of the market and the network dynamics and derive dissipativity-based conditions leading to a pertinent notion of equilibrium. We then focus on the control design and adopt the light-touch policy to incentivize or penalize the service providers as little as possible, while steering the networked system to a desirable outcome. We also provide a dimensionality reduction procedure, which offers network-size-independent conditions. Finally, we illustrate our novel notions and algorithms on a simulation setup stemming from digital market regulations for influencers, a topic of growing interest.",

    "summary": "This paper models a sociotechnical system as a linear dynamical system influenced by noncooperative agents (service providers) in a generalized Nash game, deriving conditions for equilibrium and designing minimal incentive mechanisms to steer the system towards a desired outcome. A dimensionality reduction technique allows for network-size-independent control design, illustrated by a digital market regulation simulation."

    "title": "Platform Equilibrium: Analayzing Social Welfare in Online Market Places",
    "published_date": "2023-09-15",
    "abstract": "We introduce the theoretical study of a Platform Equilibrium in a market with unit-demand buyers and unit-supply sellers. Each seller can join a platform and transact with any buyer or remain off-platform and transact with a subset of buyers whom she knows. Given the constraints on trade, prices form a competitive equilibrium and clears the market. The platform charges a transaction fee to all on-platform sellers, in the form of a fraction of on-platform sellers' price. The platform chooses the fraction to maximize revenue. A Platform Equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium of the game where each seller decides whether or not to join the platform, balancing the effect of a larger pool of buyers to trade with, against the imposition of a transaction fee. Our main insights are: (i) In homogeneous-goods markets, pure equilibria always exist and can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm; (ii) When the platform is unregulated, the resulting Platform Equilibrium guarantees a tight $\\Theta(log(min(m, n)))$-approximation of the optimal welfare in homogeneous-goods markets, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of buyers and sellers respectively; (iii) Even light regulation helps: when the platform's fee is capped at $\\alpha\\in[0,1)$, the price of anarchy is 2-$\\alpha$/1-$\\alpha$ for general markets. For example, if the platform takes 30 percent of the seller's revenue, a rather high fee, our analysis implies the welfare in a Platform Equilibrium is still a 0.412-fraction of the optimal welfare. Our main results extend to markets with multiple platforms, beyond unit-demand buyers, as well as to sellers with production costs.",
    "summary": "This paper analyzes platform equilibria in online marketplaces, modeling sellers' decisions to join a fee-charging platform versus trading directly with known buyers. The authors show that even with unregulated platform fees, social welfare is approximately logarithmic in the number of buyers and sellers, and light regulation significantly improves welfare guarantees."

    "title": "Exploring Antitrust and Platform Power in Generative AI",
    "published_date": "2023-06-20",
    "abstract": "The concentration of power in a few digital technology companies has become a subject of increasing interest in both academic and non-academic discussions. One of the most noteworthy contributions to the debate is Lina Khan's Amazon's Antitrust Paradox. In this work, Khan contends that Amazon has systematically exerted its dominance in online retail to eliminate competitors and subsequently charge above-market prices. This work contributed to Khan's appointment as the chair of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), one of the most influential antitrust organisations. Today, several ongoing antitrust lawsuits in the US and Europe involve major technology companies like Apple, Google/Alphabet, and Facebook/Meta. In the realm of generative AI, we are once again witnessing the same companies taking the lead in technological advancements, leaving little room for others to compete. This article examines the market dominance of these corporations in the technology stack behind generative AI from an antitrust law perspective.",
    "summary": "This article analyzes the antitrust implications of the concentrated power of a few major tech companies in the generative AI market, arguing that their dominance in the underlying technology stack mirrors past monopolistic practices and raises concerns similar to those discussed in Lina Khan's work on Amazon."

    "title": "Federated Learning as a Network Effects Game",
    "published_date": "2023-02-16",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) aims to foster collaboration among a population of clients to improve the accuracy of machine learning without directly sharing local data. Although there has been rich literature on designing federated learning algorithms, most prior works implicitly assume that all clients are willing to participate in a FL scheme. In practice, clients may not benefit from joining in FL, especially in light of potential costs related to issues such as privacy and computation. In this work, we study the clients' incentives in federated learning to help the service provider design better solutions and ensure clients make better decisions. We are the first to model clients' behaviors in FL as a network effects game, where each client's benefit depends on other clients who also join the network. Using this setup we analyze the dynamics of clients' participation and characterize the equilibrium, where no client has incentives to alter their decision. Specifically, we show that dynamics in the population naturally converge to equilibrium without needing explicit interventions. Finally, we provide a cost-efficient payment scheme that incentivizes clients to reach a desired equilibrium when the initial network is empty.",

    "title": "Algorithmic Collusion or Competition: the Role of Platforms' Recommender Systems",
    "published_date": "2023-09-25",
    "abstract": "Recent scholarly work has extensively examined the phenomenon of algorithmic collusion driven by AI-enabled pricing algorithms. However, online platforms commonly deploy recommender systems that influence how consumers discover and purchase products, thereby shaping the reward structures faced by pricing algorithms and ultimately affecting competition dynamics and equilibrium outcomes. To address this gap in the literature and elucidate the role of recommender systems, we propose a novel repeated game framework that integrates several key components. We first develop a structural search model to characterize consumers' decision-making processes in response to varying recommendation sets. This model incorporates both observable and unobservable heterogeneity in utility and search cost functions, and is estimated using real-world data. Building on the resulting consumer model, we formulate personalized recommendation algorithms designed to maximize either platform revenue or consumer utility. We further introduce pricing algorithms for sellers and integrate all these elements to facilitate comprehensive numerical experiments. Our experimental findings reveal that a revenue-maximizing recommender system intensifies algorithmic collusion, whereas a utility-maximizing recommender system encourages more competitive pricing behavior among sellers. Intriguingly, and contrary to conventional insights from the industrial organization and choice modeling literature, increasing the size of recommendation sets under a utility-maximizing regime does not consistently enhance consumer utility. Moreover, the degree of horizontal differentiation moderates this phenomenon in unexpected ways. The\"more is less\"effect does not arise at low levels of differentiation, but becomes increasingly pronounced as horizontal differentiation increases.",

    "summary": "This paper models the interaction between recommender systems and pricing algorithms on online platforms, finding that revenue-maximizing recommendation systems promote algorithmic collusion, while utility-maximizing systems encourage competition; surprisingly, larger recommendation sets don't always benefit consumers, especially with high product differentiation."
