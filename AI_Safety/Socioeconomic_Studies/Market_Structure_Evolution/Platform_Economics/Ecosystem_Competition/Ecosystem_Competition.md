### Mini Description

Study of how AI platforms compete, cooperate, and evolve within larger digital ecosystems and platform networks

### Description

Ecosystem Competition in AI-driven platforms examines how platforms compete, collaborate, and evolve within broader digital ecosystems. This encompasses studying competitive dynamics between platforms vying for market share, the formation and evolution of platform alliances, and the emergence of specialized niches within larger ecosystem structures. Key research questions address how AI capabilities influence ecosystem boundaries, enable new forms of platform differentiation, and affect the stability of competitive equilibria.

A central focus is understanding how AI-driven platforms navigate the tension between competition and cooperation, including decisions about API access, data sharing, and cross-platform compatibility. Researchers investigate how platforms leverage AI capabilities to defend their competitive positions while simultaneously participating in broader ecosystem value creation. This includes studying how platforms balance the benefits of ecosystem participation against the risks of competitor access to valuable training data or algorithmic insights.

The field also examines how AI capabilities influence ecosystem governance, including the role of dominant platforms in setting technical standards, data protocols, and interaction rules. Researchers analyze how different ecosystem structures affect innovation rates, resource allocation efficiency, and the distribution of value creation opportunities. Particular attention is paid to how AI-driven automation and optimization might affect ecosystem stability, diversity, and resilience to external shocks.
