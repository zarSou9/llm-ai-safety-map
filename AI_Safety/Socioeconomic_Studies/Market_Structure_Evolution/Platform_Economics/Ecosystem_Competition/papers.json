    "title": "Strategic Investments for Platform Launch and Ecosystem Growth: A Dynamic Analysis",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Multi-sided platforms must make decisions on both pricing and engineering investment and must continually adjust them as the platform scales over its lifecycle. Engineering investments can be allocated to features that improve a platform's standalone value, social features to take advantage of same-side network effects, or integration tools and boundary resources to facilitate third-party content creation. Guidance in the academic or practitioner literature is not granular. Moreover, relevant normative economic models that consider externalities are rarely dynamic. Hence, there is a gap in knowledge about how to best balance tradeoffs between different strategic decisions throughout the entire platform lifecycle. To begin to address this gap, we explore normative strategies for coordinating pricing and engineering investment decisions on a continuous basis under different ecosystem conditions. We build a simulation model informed by economics and marketing theory and perform extensive sensitivity analyses on key parameters in different ecosystem scenarios over a multi-period lifecycle. We find that pricing and investment strategies must continuously change to perform optimally. In particular, strategies that are most effective at launch often differ from those that are most effective during scaling as well as those most effective at maturity. We also find that the optimal strategy depends strongly on the monetization model and market aversion to price changes. Lastly, we specifically examine four different industry segments: mobile platforms, social media, the sharing economy, and business-to-business. The results provide evidence that the trajectory of platform pricing and investment strategies should greatly differ depending on industrial context.",

    "summary": "This paper uses a dynamic simulation model to analyze optimal pricing and engineering investment strategies for multi-sided platforms across their lifecycle, finding that optimal strategies vary significantly depending on platform stage, monetization model, market conditions, and industry segment. The research highlights the need for continuous adaptation of these strategies for sustained platform growth."

    "summary": "This working paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can cooperate in the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game, exploring their capacity for altruism and reciprocal behavior. Preliminary findings suggest LLMs can partially operationalize these concepts but struggle with adapting behavior based on conditional reciprocity."

    "published_date": "2021-06-04",
    "summary": "The article explores applying game theory to AI development within organizations, highlighting its limitations and advocating for a multi-agent approach that integrates game theory with organizational principles like bureaucracy. This approach emphasizes the continued importance of human-AI collaboration, leveraging comparative advantage to address complex problems that exceed the capabilities of any single entity."

    "title": "The Economics of Platforms: A Theory Guide for Competition Policy",
    "abstract": "Abstract We propose an analysis of platform competition based on the academic literature with a view towards competition policy. First, we discuss to which extent competition can emerge in digital markets and show which forms it can take. In particular, we underline the role of dynamics, but also of platform differentiation, consumers multi-homing and beliefs to allow competition in platform markets. Second, we analyze competition policy issues and discuss how rules designed for standard markets can perform in two-sided markets. We show that multi-sided externalities create new opportunities for anti-competitive conducts, often related to pricing and contractual imperfections.",
