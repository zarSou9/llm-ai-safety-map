### Mini Description

Analysis of how AI systems influence the creation, transfer, and protection of organizational knowledge and capabilities across firm boundaries

### Description

Knowledge Management in the context of AI safety examines how artificial intelligence systems transform the ways organizations create, capture, distribute, and utilize knowledge assets. This includes studying how AI technologies affect traditional knowledge management processes while introducing new challenges around machine learning model knowledge, data governance, and the integration of human and artificial intelligence capabilities. The field explores how organizations can effectively manage both explicit knowledge captured in databases and documents, and tacit knowledge embedded in AI systems and human expertise.

A central focus is understanding how AI systems influence the dynamics of organizational learning and knowledge transfer. This includes analyzing how machine learning models can encode and transfer organizational knowledge, the challenges of maintaining consistency across distributed AI systems, and methods for effectively combining human and AI knowledge bases. Researchers investigate how AI affects the balance between knowledge exploration and exploitation, as well as how organizations can maintain strategic knowledge advantages while participating in collaborative AI development.

The field also addresses critical challenges in knowledge verification, maintenance, and protection in AI-enabled organizations. This includes developing frameworks for validating AI-generated knowledge, ensuring the preservation of critical organizational knowledge during AI system updates or replacements, and managing intellectual property rights in contexts where knowledge is increasingly embedded in AI systems. Special attention is paid to the risks of knowledge loss or corruption through AI system failures, and strategies for maintaining organizational memory in increasingly automated environments.
