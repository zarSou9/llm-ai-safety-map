### Mini Description

Study of how AI influences make-or-buy decisions, vertical integration, and the optimal scope of business activities

### Description

Firm Boundaries research in AI safety examines how artificial intelligence technologies reshape the fundamental economic decisions that determine organizational scope and structure. This includes analyzing how AI affects transaction costs, information asymmetries, and coordination capabilities that traditionally influence whether activities are performed internally or outsourced. As AI systems become more capable of handling complex tasks and processing vast amounts of information, they challenge traditional theories of firm boundaries and create new considerations for organizational design.

A key focus is understanding how AI's ability to reduce coordination costs and information friction affects vertical integration decisions. This includes studying how AI-enabled smart contracts, automated negotiation systems, and predictive analytics influence make-or-buy decisions and inter-firm relationships. Researchers examine how AI's capacity for real-time monitoring, prediction, and optimization might reduce the traditional advantages of hierarchical organization, while simultaneously creating new rationales for integration based on data synergies and algorithmic capabilities.

The field also investigates how AI technologies affect the optimal scale and scope of organizations through their impact on management capacity, knowledge transfer, and organizational learning. This includes analyzing how AI systems influence the ability to replicate best practices across units, manage complexity, and maintain strategic coherence. Special attention is paid to how data network effects and AI capability complementarities create new forms of economies of scope that may encourage expansion into adjacent markets or activities.
