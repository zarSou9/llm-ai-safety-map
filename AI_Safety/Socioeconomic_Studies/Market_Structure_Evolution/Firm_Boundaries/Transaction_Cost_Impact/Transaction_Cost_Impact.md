### Mini Description

Analysis of how AI technologies affect the costs of market transactions versus internal organization, including impacts on contracting, monitoring, and enforcement

### Description

Transaction Cost Impact analysis examines how AI technologies transform the fundamental economic costs associated with market exchanges versus internal organization. This encompasses studying how AI affects search and information costs, bargaining and decision costs, and policing and enforcement costs across different organizational arrangements. The research aims to understand how these changes influence firms' make-or-buy decisions and their broader implications for organizational structure and market relationships.

A key focus is quantifying how AI capabilities like natural language processing, automated negotiation systems, and smart contracts reduce traditional transaction costs while potentially introducing new ones. For instance, while AI can dramatically lower search costs through improved matching algorithms and reduce enforcement costs through automated monitoring, it may introduce new costs related to data integration, system maintenance, and managing AI-related risks. Researchers investigate how these shifting cost structures affect the optimal boundaries of firms and the nature of inter-organizational relationships.

The field also examines how AI's impact on transaction costs varies across different types of exchanges, market conditions, and institutional environments. This includes studying how factors such as asset specificity, frequency of exchange, and uncertainty interact with AI capabilities to influence transaction costs. Particular attention is paid to how AI might fundamentally alter Coase's theory of the firm by changing the relative efficiency of markets versus hierarchies in different contexts.
