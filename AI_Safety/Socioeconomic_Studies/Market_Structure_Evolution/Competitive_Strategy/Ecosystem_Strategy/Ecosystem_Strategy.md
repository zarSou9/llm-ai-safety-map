### Mini Description

Analysis of how firms develop and execute strategies involving AI partnerships, alliances, and ecosystem participation to enhance competitive position

### Description

Ecosystem Strategy in AI markets examines how organizations navigate and shape complex networks of partnerships, platforms, and complementary capabilities to create and capture value. This research area focuses on understanding how firms can effectively participate in, contribute to, and potentially orchestrate AI ecosystems while managing dependencies, risks, and power dynamics. Key considerations include data sharing arrangements, API governance, model integration protocols, and the development of shared standards and infrastructure.

A central challenge is balancing cooperation and competition within AI ecosystems, particularly as organizations simultaneously collaborate with and compete against ecosystem partners. Researchers investigate how firms can maintain strategic autonomy while benefiting from ecosystem participation, including strategies for managing intellectual property, protecting core capabilities, and ensuring fair value distribution. This includes studying how organizations can leverage ecosystem resources without becoming overly dependent on dominant players or locked into specific technological trajectories.

The field also examines how different ecosystem roles and positions affect competitive advantage and strategic options. This encompasses studying ecosystem orchestration strategies, including platform governance mechanisms, incentive design, and boundary resource management. Researchers analyze how organizations can build and maintain ecosystem-specific advantages, including network effects, data network effects, and complementary innovation capacity. Special attention is paid to how ecosystem participation affects organizational learning, innovation trajectories, and the development of AI capabilities.
