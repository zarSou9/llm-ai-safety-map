    "title": "Artificial Intelligence, Algorithmic Competition and Market Structures",
    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of pricing algorithms to increase profits is becoming ubiquitous. However, the literature has focused on specific markets and algorithms so far, but it is unclear what happens across algorithms and markets. To analyze the business and economic impact of pricing algorithms, we build a computational model that considers two sophisticated AI algorithms (Q-learning and Particle Swarm Optimization) competing in prices in three different market structures (Logit, Hotelling, and linear demand models). From a social perspective, we find that PSO outperforms Q-learning, which tends to set supracompetitive prices. However, small changes in the algorithm designs may drive them to set more competitive prices, implying that a proper analysis of algorithmic competition requires considering the details of the algorithms and the market structure. When firms compete on algorithms, algorithms may generate price dispersion. Additionally, when facing a traditional competitor that uses a best-response function, algorithms tend to set supracompetitive prices, and both firms earn extra profits, but the traditional competitor benefits the most. Overall, the article contributes to understanding algorithmic competition, discusses implications for managers and policymakers, and identifies opportunities for future research.",

    "title": "Strategic Collusion of LLM Agents: Market Division in Multi-Commodity Competitions",
    "published_date": "2024-09-19",
    "abstract": "Machine-learning technologies are seeing increased deployment in real-world market scenarios. In this work, we explore the strategic behaviors of large language models (LLMs) when deployed as autonomous agents in multi-commodity markets, specifically within Cournot competition frameworks. We examine whether LLMs can independently engage in anti-competitive practices such as collusion or, more specifically, market division. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively monopolize specific commodities by dynamically adjusting their pricing and resource allocation strategies, thereby maximizing profitability without direct human input or explicit collusion commands. These results pose unique challenges and opportunities for businesses looking to integrate AI into strategic roles and for regulatory bodies tasked with maintaining fair and competitive markets. The study provides a foundation for further exploration into the ramifications of deferring high-stakes decisions to LLM-based agents.",
    "summary": "The study shows that large language models (LLMs), acting as autonomous agents in a competitive market, can spontaneously collude to divide and monopolize commodities, maximizing profits without explicit instruction. This highlights potential anti-competitive risks and regulatory challenges associated with deploying LLMs in strategic market roles."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence and Strategic Decision-Making: Evidence from Entrepreneurs and Investors",
    "published_date": "2024-08-16",
    "abstract": "This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) may impact the strategic decision-making (SDM) process in firms. We illustrate how AI could augment existing SDM tools and provide empirical evidence from a leading accelerator program and a start-up competition that current large language models can generate and evaluate strategies at a level comparable to entrepreneurs and investors. We then examine implications for the key cognitive processes underlying SDMâ€”search, representation, and aggregation. Our analysis suggests that AI has the potential to enhance the speed, quality, and scale of strategic analysis, while also enabling new approaches, like virtual strategy simulations. However, the ultimate impact on firm performance will depend on competitive dynamics as AI capabilities progress. We propose a framework connecting AI use in SDM to firm outcomes and discuss how AI may reshape sources of competitive advantage. We conclude by considering how AI could both support and challenge core tenets of the theory-based view of strategy. Overall, our work maps out an emerging research frontier at the intersection of AI and strategy. History: This paper has been accepted for the Strategy Science Special Issue on Theory-Based View.

    "published_date": "2024-06-03",
    "abstract": "As frontier AI models advance, policy proposals for safe AI development are gaining increasing attention from researchers and policymakers. This paper explores the current integration in the AI supply chain, focusing on vertical relationships and strategic partnerships among AI labs, cloud providers, chip manufacturers, and lithography companies. It aims to lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the implications of various governance interventions, including antitrust measures. The study has two main contributions. First, it profiles 25 leading companies in the AI supply chain, analyzing 300 relationships and noting 80 significant mergers and acquisitions along with 40 antitrust cases. Second, we discuss potential market definitions and the integration drivers based on the observed trends. The analysis reveals predominant horizontal integration through natural growth rather than acquisitions and notable trends of backward vertical integration in the semiconductor supply chain. Strategic partnerships are also significant downstream, especially between AI companies and cloud providers, with large tech companies often pursuing conglomerate integration by acquiring specialized AI startups or forming alliances with frontier AI labs. To further understand the strategic partnerships in the industry, we provide three brief case studies featuring companies like OpenAI and Nvidia. We conclude by posing open research questions on market dynamics and possible governance interventions, such as licensing and safety audits.",

    "title": "A Market for Lemons? Strategic Directions for a Vigilant Application of Artificial Intelligence in Entrepreneurship Research",
    "published_date": "2024-09-13",
    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of AI adoption (e.g., using machine learning, deep learning, or large language models as research methods) and the increasing availability of big data have the potential to bring about the most significant transformation in entrepreneurship scholarship the field has ever witnessed. This article makes a pressing meta-contribution by highlighting a significant risk of unproductive knowledge exchanges in entrepreneurship research amid the AI revolution. It offers strategies to mitigate this risk and provides guidance for future AI-based studies to enhance their collective impact and relevance. Drawing on Akerlof's renowned market-for-lemons concept, we identify the potential for significant knowledge asymmetries emerging from the field's evolution into its current landscape (e.g., complexities around construct validity, theory building, and research relevance). Such asymmetries are particularly deeply ingrained due to what we term the double-black-box puzzle, where the widely recognized black box nature of AI methods intersects with the black box nature of the entrepreneurship phenomenon driven by inherent uncertainty. As a result, these asymmetries could lead to an increase in suboptimal research products that go undetected, collectively creating a market for lemons that undermines the field's well-being, reputation, and impact. However, importantly, if these risks can be mitigated, the AI revolution could herald a new golden era for entrepreneurship research. We discuss the necessary actions to elevate the field to a higher level of AI resilience while steadfastly maintaining its foundational principles and core values.",
    "summary": "This paper warns of a \"market for lemons\" in entrepreneurship research using AI, driven by knowledge asymmetries stemming from the \"double-black-box\" problem (AI methods and entrepreneurial phenomena). It proposes strategies to mitigate this risk and maximize the benefits of AI in the field."

    "published_date": "2023-12-09",
    "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape the knowledge economy by enabling problem solving at scale. This paper introduces a framework to analyze this transformation, incorporating AI into an economy where humans form hierarchical firms to use their time efficiently: Less knowledgeable individuals become\"workers\"solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable individuals become\"solvers\"assisting workers with exceptional problems. We model AI as a technology that transforms computing power into\"AI agents,\"which can either operate autonomously (as co-workers or solvers/co-pilots) or non-autonomously (only as co-pilots). We show that basic autonomous AI displaces humans towards specialized problem solving, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced autonomous AI reallocates humans to routine work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. While autonomous AI primarily benefits the most knowledgeable individuals, non-autonomous AI disproportionately benefits the least knowledgeable. However, autonomous AI achieves higher overall output. These findings reconcile seemingly contradictory empirical evidence and reveal key tradeoffs involved in regulating AI autonomy.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on hierarchical firms within a knowledge economy, finding that basic autonomous AI leads to smaller, less productive firms while advanced autonomous AI results in larger, more productive ones, with differing distributional effects depending on AI autonomy levels. The model reveals trade-offs in regulating AI autonomy based on its impact on firm structure and overall productivity."

    "published_date": "2022-02-12",
    "abstract": "We develop a tractable model for studying strategic interactions between learning algorithms. We uncover a mechanism responsible for the emergence of algorithmic collusion. We observe that algorithms periodically coordinate on actions that are more profitable than static Nash equilibria. This novel collusive channel relies on an endogenous statistical linkage in the algorithms' estimates which we call spontaneous coupling. The model's parameters predict whether the statistical linkage will appear, and what market structures facilitate algorithmic collusion. We show that spontaneous coupling can sustain collusion in prices and market shares, complementing experimental findings in the literature. Finally, we apply our results to design algorithmic markets.",

The model identifies parameters predicting this collusion and market structures that facilitate it, offering insights for designing anti-collusive algorithmic markets."

    "published_date": "2022-01-02",
    "abstract": "This paper develops a formal framework to assess policies of learning algorithms in economic games. We investigate whether reinforcement-learning agents with collusive pricing policies can successfully extrapolate collusive behavior from training to the market. We find that in testing environments collusion consistently breaks down. Instead, we observe static Nash play. We then show that restricting algorithms' strategy space can make algorithmic collusion robust, because it limits overfitting to rival strategies. Our findings suggest that policy-makers should focus on firm behavior aimed at coordinating algorithm design in order to make collusive policies robust.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning agents, despite initially exhibiting collusive pricing behavior during training, revert to non-cooperative Nash equilibrium in market settings; however, restricting the algorithms' strategy space enhances the robustness of collusion by mitigating overfitting."
