### Mini Description

Study of how firms position themselves in AI-transformed markets, including choices about target markets, value propositions, and competitive differentiation

### Description

Strategic Positioning in AI-transformed markets examines how organizations establish and maintain advantageous market positions through their choices about where and how to compete. This involves analyzing how AI capabilities reshape traditional positioning strategies while creating new dimensions for differentiation, such as data access, algorithmic sophistication, and AI-enabled customer experience. Research focuses on understanding how firms can develop sustainable competitive positions that leverage AI capabilities while accounting for rapid technological change and evolving customer needs.

A key challenge in this domain is balancing specificity and adaptability in positioning choices. Organizations must decide whether to position themselves as AI-first companies, AI-enabled traditional players, or hybrid entities, while considering how these choices affect their ability to serve different market segments and respond to competitive threats. This includes examining how firms can maintain strategic clarity while preserving the flexibility to pivot as AI capabilities and market demands evolve.

Researchers investigate how AI transforms the fundamental bases of positioning, including cost structures, differentiation opportunities, and focus strategies. This encompasses studying how organizations can effectively signal their AI capabilities to stakeholders, how to position themselves in markets where AI is becoming table stakes, and how to develop distinctive value propositions that combine human and artificial intelligence. Special attention is paid to understanding how positioning choices affect an organization's ability to attract talent, secure resources, and build lasting customer relationships in AI-transformed markets.
