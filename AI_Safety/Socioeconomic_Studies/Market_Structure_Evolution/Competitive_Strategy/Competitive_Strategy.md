Analysis of how AI deployment affects competitive positioning, pricing strategies, and value creation models

### Description

Competitive Strategy in AI-driven markets examines how organizations develop and execute strategies to create sustainable competitive advantages in environments transformed by artificial intelligence. This includes analyzing how AI capabilities affect traditional strategic frameworks, such as cost leadership and differentiation, while introducing new dimensions of competition around data assets, algorithmic capabilities, and AI-enabled personalization. Research in this area focuses on understanding how firms can effectively leverage AI to enhance their competitive position while managing associated risks and dependencies.

A key aspect of this field is studying how AI transforms the fundamental bases of competition. This includes examining how AI capabilities enable new forms of dynamic pricing, predictive analytics-driven decision making, and automated optimization of business processes. Researchers investigate how organizations can build defensible competitive positions through AI-enabled strategic assets, including proprietary datasets, specialized AI models, and unique combinations of human and artificial intelligence capabilities. Special attention is paid to how firms can maintain strategic flexibility while building deep AI capabilities, given the rapid pace of technological change.

The field also explores how AI affects competitive dynamics across different market contexts and industry structures. This includes studying how organizations can effectively compete against AI-native firms, how incumbent advantages may be eroded or enhanced by AI capabilities, and how firms can develop ecosystem strategies that leverage AI partnerships and collaborations. Researchers examine the trade-offs between first-mover advantages in AI adoption and the risks of early commitment to specific technological approaches, as well as how organizations can build and maintain competitive advantages in markets where AI capabilities are increasingly commoditized.
