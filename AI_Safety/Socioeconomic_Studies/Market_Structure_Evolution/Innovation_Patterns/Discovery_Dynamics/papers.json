    "title": "The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Ideation and the performance of Innovation Teams (Preprint)",
    "published_date": "2024-09-23",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on the dynam-ics and performance of innovation teams during the idea generation phase of the innovation process. Utilizing a custom AI-augmented ideation tool, the study applies the Knowledge Spill-over Theory of Entrepreneurship to understand the effects of AI on knowledge spillover, gen-eration and application. Through a framed field experiment with participants divided into exper-imental and control groups, findings indicate that AI-augmented teams generated higher quali-ty ideas in less time. GenAI application led to improved efficiency, knowledge exchange, in-creased satisfaction and engagement as well as enhanced idea diversity. These results high-light the transformative role of the field of AI within the innovation management domain and shows that GenAI has a positive impact on important elements of the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepeneurship, emphasizing its potential impact on innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. Future research should further explore the dynamic interaction be-tween GenAI and creative processes.",
    "summary": "A field experiment found that generative AI tools significantly improved the efficiency and quality of idea generation in innovation teams, increasing idea diversity and team satisfaction while reducing ideation time. This supports the positive impact of generative AI on knowledge spillover and innovation processes."

    "title": "The innovation paradox: concept space expansion with diminishing originality and the promise of creative artificial intelligence",
    "published_date": "2023-03-23",
    "abstract": "Abstract Innovation, typically spurred by reusing, recombining and synthesizing existing concepts, is expected to result in an exponential growth of the concept space over time. However, our statistical analysis of TechNet, which is a comprehensive technology semantic network encompassing over 4 million concepts derived from patent texts, reveals a linear rather than exponential expansion of the overall technological concept space. Moreover, there is a notable decline in the originality of newly created concepts. These trends can be attributed to the constraints of human cognitive abilities to innovate beyond an ever-growing space of prior art, among other factors. Integrating creative artificial intelligence into the innovation process holds the potential to overcome these limitations and alter the observed trends in the future.",

    "summary": "Analysis of a large technology network reveals linear, not exponential, concept space growth and declining originality of innovations, potentially due to human cognitive limitations; AI offers a potential solution to overcome these constraints."

    "title": "New Kids on the Block: On the impact of information retrieval on contextual resource integration patterns",
    "published_date": "2023-12-13",
    "abstract": "The rise of new modes of interaction with AI skyrocketed the popularity, applicability, and amount of use cases. Despite this evolution, conceptual integration is falling behind. Studies suggest that there is hardly a systematization in using AI in organizations. Thus, by taking a service-dominant logic perspective, specifically, the concept of resource integration patterns, the most potent application of AI for organizational use - namely information retrieval - is analyzed. In doing so, we propose a systematization that can be applied to deepen understanding of core technical concepts, further investigate AI in contexts, and help explore research directions guided by SDL.",
    "summary": "This paper analyzes the impact of information retrieval (a key AI application) on organizational resource integration, using a service-dominant logic perspective to propose a systematization for understanding and researching AI's contextual use. It addresses the gap between AI's growing popularity and the lack of systematic understanding of its organizational integration."

    "title": "The dynamics of higher-order novelties",
    "published_date": "2023-07-12",
    "abstract": "Studying how we explore the world in search of novelties is key to understand the mechanisms that can lead to new discoveries. Previous studies analyzed novelties in various exploration processes, defining them as the first appearance of an element. However, novelties can also be generated by combining what is already known. We hence define higher-order novelties as the first time two or more elements appear together, and we introduce higher-order Heaps' exponents as a way to characterize their pace of discovery. Through extensive analysis of real-world data, we find that processes with the same pace of discovery, as measured by the standard Heaps' exponent, can instead differ at higher orders. We then propose to model an exploration process as a random walk on a network in which the possible connections between elements evolve in time. The model reproduces the empirical properties of higher-order novelties, revealing how the network we explore changes over time along with the exploration process.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces \"higher-order novelties,\" defined as the first co-occurrence of multiple known elements, and uses higher-order Heaps' exponents to analyze their discovery rate in real-world data. A novel random-walk network model successfully reproduces the observed dynamics of higher-order novelties, revealing how network structure evolves during exploration."

    "published_date": "2023-02-08",
    "summary": "The article advocates for a multidisciplinary approach to AI safety research, arguing that achieving safe artificial general intelligence (AGI) requires integrating diverse fields like cognitive science, social sciences, and engineering, and prioritizing collaborative, pragmatic research over isolated theoretical developments. This holistic approach aims to design \"civilisational intelligence\" rather than solely focusing on technical alignment solutions."

    "published_date": "2023-08-28",
    "summary": "The article explores the concept of \"design paradigms\" in engineering and AI, analogous to scientific paradigms in Kuhn's philosophy of science. It proposes three criteria for evaluating design paradigms and applies these to a case study comparing different AI approaches, highlighting the significant impact of paradigm choices on the development of artificial systems."
