    "title": "Automated Gateways: A Smart Contract-Powered Solution for Interoperability Across Blockchains",
    "published_date": "2024-07-17",
    "abstract": "Interoperability is a significant challenge in blockchain technology, hindering seamless data and service sharing across diverse blockchain networks. This study introduces Automated Gateways as a novel framework leveraging smart contracts to facilitate interoperability. Unlike existing solutions, which often require adopting new technologies or relying on external services, Automated Gateways framework is integrated directly with a blockchain's core infrastructure to enhance systems with built-in interoperability features. By implementing fine-grained access control mechanisms, smart contracts within this framework manage accessibility and authorization for cross-chain interactions and facilitate streamlining the selective sharing of services between blockchains. Our evaluation demonstrates the framework's capability to handle cross-chain interactions efficiently, significantly reduce operational complexities, and uphold transactional integrity and security across different blockchain networks. With its focus on user-friendliness, self-managed permissions, and independence from external platforms, this framework is designed to achieve broader adoption within the blockchain community.",
    "summary": "Automated Gateways is a smart contract-based framework enabling interoperability between blockchains by directly integrating with core infrastructure to manage cross-chain interactions, enhancing security, efficiency, and accessibility without relying on external services. This framework prioritizes user-friendliness, fine-grained access control, and self-managed permissions."

    "title": "Intersecting Liminality: Acquiring a Smartphone as a Blind or Low Vision Older Adult",
    "published_date": "2024-09-04",
    "abstract": "Older adults are increasingly acquiring smartphones. But acquiring smartphones can be difficult, and little is known about the particular challenges of older adults who are additionally blind or losing their vision. We shed light on the social and technical aspects of acquiring smartphones with vision loss, based on deep qualitative interviews with 22 blind or low vision (BLV) older adults aged 60 and over. Through our grounded theory analysis, we found that BLV older adults experience liminality as they acquire smartphones and transition through re-acquiring smartphones as they become blind, and they can transition through liminality by participating in mutual aid within the blind community. We contribute the notion of\"Intersecting Liminality,\"which explains the marginalizing experience of simultaneously transitioning through vision loss, aging, and technology acquisition. We contend that Intersecting Liminality can serve as a framework that centers the dynamic nature of disability to help our community generate a more nuanced understanding of technology acquisition and more effective assistive interventions.",
    "summary": "This study uses qualitative interviews with 22 blind or low-vision older adults to explore the challenges of smartphone acquisition, revealing a phenomenon of \"Intersecting Liminality\" where the simultaneous transitions of aging, vision loss, and technology adoption create marginalization. Mutual aid within the blind community helps navigate this challenging liminal space."

    "title": "Smooth Operators, Predictable Glitches: The Interface Governance of Benefits and Borders",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the phenomenon of interface governance. It uses two interface technologies—Universal Credit's digital account (United Kingdom) and ArriveCAN (Canada)—to explore how interfaces and their predictable glitches govern relations between state officials and members of the public. Drawing on tools of government literature, it argues that interfaces do not achieve their stated goals evenly (improved efficiency, digital literacy). Instead, they generate several unintended effects, including heightened bureaucratic intensity, diffused responsibility, and even eroded public trust in state agencies. It urges socio-legal and administrative justice scholars to take interfaces seriously and calls on scholars to adopt socio-legal-technical methods to better conceptualize the effects of infrastructure governance and to imagine other possibilities for public administration.",

    "summary": "This article analyzes how the interfaces of Universal Credit and ArriveCAN, despite aiming for efficiency and improved digital literacy, unexpectedly increase bureaucratic intensity, diffuse responsibility, and erode public trust. It advocates for socio-legal-technical methods to better understand and improve interface governance in public administration."

    "title": "From research activities to institutional piloting: the challenges of modernizing interfaces and data interoperability",
    "published_date": "2023-04-11",
    "abstract": "Research activities are generally observed and evaluated through the prism of their production and financial elements or team composition. In addition to standardized management indicators and bibliometrics, the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) has been building new indicators for the last ten years, based on the annual regulatory declarations of the Institute's researchers. Different quality management tools allow the evolution of the different interfaces. This source of data, more ''open'' and more ''useful'' through its integration into the Institute's information system, is adapted to the needs of the multi-year management of research at the IRD. The aim is twofold: (1) to make progress in the evaluation of research and in the mastery of information by all actors, (2) to enlighten as many actors as possible via more efficient digital circuits and tools. The purpose of this article is to explain how the IRD is changing the entire production chain and the indicators of researchers' activities to better map scientific activities.",
    "summary": "The French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) is modernizing its research evaluation system by integrating researchers' annual declarations into a new, more comprehensive information system. This aims to improve research evaluation, enhance data interoperability, and provide more efficient digital tools for all stakeholders."

    "title": "A Vision for Science Gateways: Bridging the Gap and Broadening the Outreach",
    "abstract": "The future for science gateways warrants exploration as we consider the possibilities that extend well beyond 'science' and high-performance computing into new interfaces, applications and user communities. In this paper, we look retrospectively at the successes of representative gateways thus far. This serves to highlight existing gaps gateways need to overcome in areas such as accessibility, usability and interoperability, and in the need for broader outreach by drawing insights from technology adoption research. We explore two particularly promising opportunities for gateways - computational social sciences and virtual reality – and make the case for the gateway community to be more intentional in engaging with users to encourage adoption and implementation, especially in the area of educational usage. We conclude with a call for focused attention on legal hurdles in order to realize the full future potential of science gateways. This paper serves as a roadmap for a vision of science gateways in the next ten years.",
