    "title": "Reflection of Hierarchical Relationship via Nuanced Conditioning of Game Theory Approach for AI Development and Utilization - LessWrong",
    "published_date": "2023-02-07",
    "summary": "The article explores applying game theory to AI development within organizational structures, highlighting its limitations in complex scenarios. It argues that despite AI advancements, bureaucratic structures, characterized by hierarchical authority and specialized tasks, will remain necessary due to the inherent limitations of any single AI agent in handling all aspects of complex problem-solving."

    "title": "Introduction: policy integration and institutional capacity: theoretical, conceptual and empirical challenges",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The issue of institutional capacity has received increased attention in the research on policy integration, bringing about the proliferation of conceptions aimed at capturing the linkage between cross-sectoral aspects of policy designs and the specific attributes that governmental institutions and processes should possess in order to effectively formulate and implement integrated policies. This article contributes to reducing conceptual and analytical fragmentation in this field by elaborating on the different dimensions which compose the broadly defined 'institutional capacity' and outlining its link with policy integration. More specifically, our objective is threefold. First, we elaborate on the theoretical and conceptual accounts of institutional capacity with particular regard to integrated policy designs, suggesting an analytical framework that unpacks the different dimensions of institutional capacity through a range of empirical indicators. Second, we discuss the analytical, conceptual and empirical challenges that arise with the study of institutional capacities for policy integration, drawing also on the main findings provided by the contributions to the Thematic Issue. Third, we suggest some promising venues for future research and collect a number of policy-relevant recommendations on institutional capacity, policy integration and policy effectiveness.",

    "summary": "This article examines the application of game theory to AI development within organizational structures, highlighting both its usefulness in multi-agent systems and its limitations. It argues that even with advanced AI, bureaucratic structures, characterized by hierarchical authority and specialized tasks, will remain necessary for efficient goal achievement due to inherent limitations in processing information and solving complex problems."

    "published_date": "2021-05-24",
    "summary": "The article argues that Max Weber's concept of an \"Ideal Bureaucratic Structure\" offers a superior model for controlling multi-agent systems, particularly in high-stakes situations, due to its efficiency and precision. However, it acknowledges Weber's warning that this structure, while technically efficient, can be utilized by any controlling interest, highlighting the importance of considering its ethical implications."

    "summary": "This article explores the governance of artificial intelligence (AI) through the control of computing resources. The author argues that the physical, energy, and supply chain constraints of powerful computing make it a uniquely governable aspect of AI development, suggesting that restricting access to compute could improve AI safety."

    "title": "Necessary conditions for policy integration and administrative coordination reforms: an exploratory analysis",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this article, we explore the determinants of reforms intending to integrate policies and coordinate administrative units by focusing on necessary conditions. Firstly, we elaborate theoretical expectations about potential necessary conditions for cross-sectoral reforms. Secondly, we conduct a condition-oriented fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to examine our expectations, based on an original data set comparing policy integration and administrative coordination reforms, in environmental and unemployment policy, across 13 countries over 29 years. Our results indicate three necessary conditions for high reform intensity: external problem pressure is necessary for policy integration and administrative coordination in employment policy; either the strength or weakness of the reference party can take the role of necessary conditions depending on the policy field; low politicization of bureaucracy is necessary, especially for administrative coordination in environmental policy. These findings contribute to the development of a systematic theory of cross-sectoral policy and administrative change.",

    "title": "Box inversion hypothesis",
    "published_date": "2020-10-20",
    "summary": "The \"box inversion hypothesis\" proposes an approximate isomorphism between technical problems in the Agent Foundations (AF) and Comprehensive AI Services (CAIS) AI safety paradigms. This mapping, illustrated using a circle inversion metaphor, suggests that solutions to problems in one framework may translate to solutions in the other, despite differences in framing and intuition."
