    "title": "Using Geographically Weighted Models to Explore Temporal and Spatial Varying Impacts on Commute Trip Change Due to Covid-19 (preprint)",
    "published_date": "2024-01-25",
    "abstract": "COVID-19 has deeply affected daily life and travel behaviors. Understanding these changes is crucial, prompting an investigation into socio-demographic and socio-economic factors. This study used large-scale mobile device location data in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia (DMV area) to unveil the impacts of these variables on commute trip changes. It reflected short and long-term impacts through linear regression and geographically weighted regression models. Findings indicated that counties with a higher percentage of people using walking and biking during the initial phase of COVID-19 experienced greater reductions in commute trips. For the long-term effect in November, the impact of active modes became insignificant, and individuals using public modes showed more significant trip reductions. Positive correlations were observed between median income levels and reduced commute trips. Sectors requiring ongoing outdoor operations during the pandemic showed substantial negative correlations. In the DMV area, counties with a higher proportion of Democratic voters experienced less trip reduction. Applying Geographically Weighted Regression models captured local spatial relationships, showing the emergence of local correlations as the pandemic evolved, suggesting a geographical impact pattern. Initially global, the pandemic's impact on commuting behaviors became more influenced by spatial factors over time, showing localized effects.",
    "summary": "This study uses mobile location data from the DMV area to analyze how socio-demographic and economic factors influenced commute trip changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing initially widespread impacts that became increasingly localized over time, with geographically weighted regression models highlighting the emergence of spatially varying correlations."

    "title": "Quantifying the hierarchical scales of scientists'mobility",
    "published_date": "2024-01-08",
    "abstract": "Human behaviors, including scientific activities, are shaped by the hierarchical divisions of geography. As a result, researchers' mobility patterns vary across regions, influencing several aspects of the scientific community. These aspects encompass career trajectories, knowledge transfer, international collaborations, talent circulation, innovation diffusion, resource distribution, and policy development. However, our understanding of the relationship between the hierarchical regional scale and scientific movements is limited. This study aims to understand the subtle role of the geographical scales on scientists' mobility patterns across cities, countries, and continents. To this end, we analyzed 2.03 million scientists from 1960 to 2021, spanning institutions, cities, countries, and continents. We built a model based on hierarchical regions with different administrative levels and assessed the tendency for mobility from one region to another and the attractiveness of each region. Our findings reveal distinct nested hierarchies of regional scales and the dynamic of scientists' relocation patterns. This study sheds light on the complex dynamics of scientists' mobility and offers insights into how geographical scale and administrative divisions influence career decisions.",

    "title": "The impacts of remote work on travel: insights from nearly three years of monthly surveys",
    "published_date": "2023-03-10",
    "abstract": "Remote work has expanded dramatically since 2020, upending longstanding travel patterns and behavior. More fundamentally, the flexibility for remote workers to choose when and where to work has created much stronger connections between travel behavior and organizational behavior. This paper uses a large and comprehensive monthly longitudinal survey over nearly three years to identify new trends in work location choice, mode choice and departure time of remote workers. The travel behavior of remote workers is found to be highly associated with employer characteristics, task characteristics, employer remote work policies, coordination between colleagues and attitudes towards remote work. Approximately one third of all remote work hours are shown to take place outside of the home, accounting for over one third of all commuting trips. These commutes to\"third places\"are shorter, less likely to occur during peak periods, and more likely to use sustainable travel modes than commutes to an employer's primary workplace. Hybrid work arrangements are also associated with a greater number of non-work trips than fully remote and fully in-person arrangements. Implications of this research for policy makers, shared mobility provides and land use planning are discussed.",

    "summary": "A nearly three-year longitudinal survey reveals that remote work significantly alters travel patterns, with a third of remote work hours occurring in \"third places\" resulting in shorter, off-peak commutes often using sustainable modes; hybrid work arrangements, meanwhile, correlate with more non-work trips."

    "title": "Multiscale mobility patterns and the restriction of human movement",
    "published_date": "2022-01-17",
    "abstract": "From the perspective of human mobility, the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a natural experiment of enormous reach in space and time. Here, we analyse the inherent multiple scales of human mobility using Facebook Movement maps collected before and during the first UK lockdown. Firstly, we obtain the pre-lockdown UK mobility graph and employ multiscale community detection to extract, in an unsupervised manner, a set of robust partitions into flow communities at different levels of coarseness. The partitions so obtained capture intrinsic mobility scales with better coverage than nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) regions, which suffer from mismatches between human mobility and administrative divisions. Furthermore, the flow communities in the fine-scale partition not only match well the UK travel to work areas but also capture mobility patterns beyond commuting to work. We also examine the evolution of mobility under lockdown and show that mobility first reverted towards fine-scale flow communities already found in the pre-lockdown data, and then expanded back towards coarser flow communities as restrictions were lifted. The improved coverage induced by lockdown is well captured by a linear decay shock model, which allows us to quantify regional differences in both the strength of the effect and the recovery time from the lockdown shock.",

    "summary": "This study uses Facebook Movement data to analyze multiscale human mobility patterns in the UK before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown, revealing that lockdown initially restricted movement to smaller, pre-existing flow communities before gradually expanding back to larger scales as restrictions eased. A linear decay shock model quantifies regional differences in lockdown impact and recovery time."

    "title": "The emerging spectrum of flexible work locations: implications for travel demand and carbon emissions",
    "published_date": "2022-01-04",
    "abstract": "Many studies of the effect of remote work on travel demand assume that remote work takes place entirely at home. Recent evidence, however, shows that in the United States, remote workers are choosing to spend approximately one third of their remote work hours outside of the home at cafes, co-working spaces or the homes of friends and family. Commutes to these\"third places\"could offset much of the reduction in congestion and carbon emissions from commuting that could be expected from greater shares of remote work. To estimate the impact of third places on congestion and carbon emission from commuting, this study uses a national survey of thousands of remote workers and large-scale mobile trace data to predict current and future commuting patterns for the Chicago metropolitan area. The study reveals that ignoring third places leads to an underestimation of carbon emissions from commute-based travel demand by 470 gigatons per year, or 24% of the total true emissions. Moreover, if workers' latent desire for greater levels of remote work are realized in the future, the emissions benefits will be reduced further. The spatial analyses imply that there is a decrease in visits to the city center and outskirts, but an increase in visits to near suburban areas. Implications of these results for urban transportation and land use policy are discussed.",
    "citation_count": 3,
    "summary": "Remote work's impact on travel and carbon emissions is underestimated because workers frequently use \"third places\" (e.g., cafes, co-working spaces) for remote work, generating significant commuting that offsets emissions reductions from reduced home-based commutes. Ignoring these \"third places\" leads to a substantial underestimation of carbon emissions from commuting, especially as remote work increases."

    "title": "Preparing urban mobility for the future of work (preprint)/ en",
    "published_date": "2022-01-04",
    "abstract": "A gradual growth in flexible work over many decades has been suddenly and dramatically accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The share of flexible work days in the United States is forecasted to grow from 4\\% in 2018 to over 26\\% by 2022. This rapid and unexpected shift in the nature of work will have a profound effect on the demand for, and supply of, urban transportation. Understanding how people make decisions around where and with whom to work will be critical for predicting future travel patterns and designing mobility systems to serve flexible commuters. To that end, this paper establishes a formal taxonomy for describing possible flexible work arrangements, the stakeholders involved and the relationships between them. An analytical framework is then developed for adapting existing transportation models to incorporate the unique dynamics of flexible work location choice. Several examples are provided to demonstrate how the new taxonomy and analytical framework can be applied across a broad set of scenarios. Finally, a critical research agenda is proposed to create both the empirical knowledge and methodological tools to prepare urban mobility for the future of work.",
    "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift towards flexible work, significantly impacting urban transportation demand; this paper proposes a taxonomy of flexible work arrangements and an analytical framework to adapt transportation models for predicting and managing this change."
