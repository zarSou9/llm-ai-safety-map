    "title": "AgentMove: Predicting Human Mobility Anywhere Using Large Language Model based Agentic Framework",
    "published_date": "2024-08-26",
    "abstract": "Human mobility prediction plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Although deep learning based models have shown promising results over the past decade, their reliance on extensive private mobility data for training and their inability to perform zero-shot predictions, have hindered further advancements. Recently, attempts have been made to apply large language models (LLMs) to mobility prediction task. However, their performance has been constrained by the absence of a systematic design of workflow. They directly generate the final output using LLMs, which limits the potential of LLMs to uncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of global geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AgentMove, a systematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized mobility prediction for any cities worldwide. In AgentMove, we first decompose the mobility prediction task into three sub-tasks and then design corresponding modules to complete these subtasks, including spatial-temporal memory for individual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the effects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the shared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments on mobility data from two sources in 12 cities demonstrate that AgentMove outperforms the best baseline more than 8% in various metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities. Codes and data can be found in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentMove.",

    "title": "Quantifying the hierarchical scales of scientists'mobility",
    "published_date": "2024-01-08",
    "abstract": "Human behaviors, including scientific activities, are shaped by the hierarchical divisions of geography. As a result, researchers' mobility patterns vary across regions, influencing several aspects of the scientific community. These aspects encompass career trajectories, knowledge transfer, international collaborations, talent circulation, innovation diffusion, resource distribution, and policy development. However, our understanding of the relationship between the hierarchical regional scale and scientific movements is limited. This study aims to understand the subtle role of the geographical scales on scientists' mobility patterns across cities, countries, and continents. To this end, we analyzed 2.03 million scientists from 1960 to 2021, spanning institutions, cities, countries, and continents. We built a model based on hierarchical regions with different administrative levels and assessed the tendency for mobility from one region to another and the attractiveness of each region. Our findings reveal distinct nested hierarchies of regional scales and the dynamic of scientists' relocation patterns. This study sheds light on the complex dynamics of scientists' mobility and offers insights into how geographical scale and administrative divisions influence career decisions.",

    "title": "Proximity Matters: Analyzing the Role of Geographical Proximity in Shaping AI Research Collaborations",
    "published_date": "2024-06-10",
    "abstract": "The role of geographical proximity in facilitating inter-regional or inter-organizational collaborations has been studied thoroughly in recent years. However, the effect of geographical proximity on forming scientific collaborations at the individual level still needs to be addressed. Using publication data in the field of artificial intelligence from 2001 to 2019, in this work, the effect of geographical proximity on the likelihood of forming future scientific collaborations among researchers is studied. In addition, the interaction between geographical and network proximities is examined to see whether network proximity can substitute geographical proximity in encouraging long-distance scientific collaborations. Employing conventional and machine learning techniques, our results suggest that geographical distance impedes scientific collaboration at the individual level despite the tremendous improvements in transportation and communication technologies during recent decades. Moreover, our findings show that the effect of network proximity on the likelihood of scientific collaboration increases with geographical distance, implying that network proximity can act as a substitute for geographical proximity.",
    "summary": "This study analyzes how geographical proximity affects AI research collaborations between individual researchers from 2001-2019, finding that closer proximity increases collaboration likelihood, while network proximity partially compensates for greater geographical distance."

    "title": "Where Would I Go Next? Large Language Models as Human Mobility Predictors",
    "published_date": "2023-08-29",
    "abstract": "Accurate human mobility prediction underpins many important applications across a variety of domains, including epidemic modelling, transport planning, and emergency responses. Due to the sparsity of mobility data and the stochastic nature of people's daily activities, achieving precise predictions of people's locations remains a challenge. While recently developed large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance across numerous language-related tasks, their applicability to human mobility studies remains unexplored. Addressing this gap, this article delves into the potential of LLMs for human mobility prediction tasks. We introduce a novel method, LLM-Mob, which leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs for analysing human mobility data. We present concepts of historical stays and context stays to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in human movement and enable time-aware prediction by using time information of the prediction target. Additionally, we design context-inclusive prompts that enable LLMs to generate more accurate predictions. Comprehensive evaluations of our method reveal that LLM-Mob excels in providing accurate and interpretable predictions, highlighting the untapped potential of LLMs in advancing human mobility prediction techniques. We posit that our research marks a significant paradigm shift in human mobility modelling, transitioning from building complex domain-specific models to harnessing general-purpose LLMs that yield accurate predictions through language instructions. The code for this work is available at https://github.com/xlwang233/LLM-Mob.",

    "title": "Differentiating geographic movement described in text documents",
    "published_date": "2022-01-10",
    "abstract": "Understanding movement described in text documents is important, since text descriptions of movement contain a wealth of geographic and contextual information about the movement of people, wildlife, goods, and much more. Our research makes several contributions to improve our understanding of movement descriptions in text. First, we show how interpreting geographic movement described in text is challenging because of general spatial terms, linguistic constructions that make the thing(s) moving unclear, and many types of temporal references and groupings, among others. Next, as a step to overcome these challenges, we report on an experiment with human subjects through which we identify multiple important characteristics of movement descriptions (found in text) that humans use to differentiate one movement description from another. Based on our empirical results, we provide recommendations for computational analysis using movement described in text documents. Our findings contribute toward an improved understanding of the important characteristics of the underused information about geographic movement that is in the form of text descriptions.",
