    "summary": "The article categorizes objects based on their \"steerable consequences\"—whether their effects diminish or expand over time. While a rock's impact is limited and unpredictable, organisms like mold or humans exhibit \"expanding steerability,\" where a small initial action can predictably cause large-scale, long-term effects."

    "title": "What are the public health implications of the life course perspective?",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT During the past decades innovative research has shown that exposure to harmful events during pregnancy and early infancy ('the first 1000 days') has an impact on health at subsequent stages of the life course and even across generations. Recently it has been shown that even the pre-conception period is of outmost importance, and other scholars have made the case that the 1000 days should be extended to a period of 8000 days post-conception. The present contribution aims to bridge further the gap between research evidence and public health policy by applying a holistic 'full-cycle' perspective. Thus, a conceptual framework is suggested for guiding public health prioritization, including the variables of 'impact on the next generation', 'plasticity' and 'available interventions with documented impact'. This framework could guide decision makers in selecting at which stages of the life course to invest (and not), and furthermore it points to some pertinent research priorities.",

    "summary": "The paper advocates for a \"full-cycle\" life course perspective in public health, arguing that exposures from preconception through early childhood significantly impact health across generations and proposing a framework to prioritize interventions based on impact, plasticity, and available evidence."
