### Mini Description

Research on how AI affects the intergenerational transmission of skills, knowledge, and cultural capital

### Description

Skill transfer patterns research examines how AI technologies affect the mechanisms and effectiveness of passing skills, knowledge, and competencies between generations. This includes studying both traditional skill transfer pathways, such as parental mentoring and formal education, and emerging dynamics unique to the AI era, like digital literacy transmission and algorithmic thinking capabilities. Researchers analyze how AI systems either facilitate or disrupt established patterns of skill inheritance while creating new forms of valuable expertise that can be passed between generations.

A central focus is understanding how AI technologies transform the relative value and transferability of different skill types. This includes examining how AI augmentation affects the durability of transferred skills, the speed at which inherited knowledge becomes obsolete, and the emergence of new meta-skills around AI interaction and adaptation. Researchers investigate how families and educational institutions adapt their skill transfer strategies in response to AI-driven changes in labor market demands and technological capabilities.

Methodologically, the field combines longitudinal studies of skill acquisition and transfer with analysis of how AI deployment affects learning environments and knowledge transmission channels. Key challenges include measuring the effectiveness of different skill transfer mechanisms in rapidly evolving technological contexts, understanding how AI-specific competencies propagate across generations, and identifying which traditional skills remain valuable for intergenerational transfer despite AI advancement. Researchers particularly focus on how different socioeconomic contexts affect families' abilities to transfer AI-relevant skills and adapt to changing skill requirements.
