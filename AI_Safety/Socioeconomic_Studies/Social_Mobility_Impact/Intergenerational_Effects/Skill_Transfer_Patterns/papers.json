    "title": "Artificial Generational Intelligence: Cultural Accumulation in Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2024-06-01",
    "abstract": "Cultural accumulation drives the open-ended and diverse progress in capabilities spanning human history. It builds an expanding body of knowledge and skills by combining individual exploration with inter-generational information transmission. Despite its widespread success among humans, the capacity for artificial learning agents to accumulate culture remains under-explored. In particular, approaches to reinforcement learning typically strive for improvements over only a single lifetime. Generational algorithms that do exist fail to capture the open-ended, emergent nature of cultural accumulation, which allows individuals to trade-off innovation and imitation. Building on the previously demonstrated ability for reinforcement learning agents to perform social learning, we find that training setups which balance this with independent learning give rise to cultural accumulation. These accumulating agents outperform those trained for a single lifetime with the same cumulative experience. We explore this accumulation by constructing two models under two distinct notions of a generation: episodic generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-context learning and train-time generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-weights learning. In-context and in-weights cultural accumulation can be interpreted as analogous to knowledge and skill accumulation, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present general models that achieve emergent cultural accumulation in reinforcement learning, opening up new avenues towards more open-ended learning systems, as well as presenting new opportunities for modelling human culture.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces artificial generational intelligence, demonstrating that reinforcement learning agents, by balancing independent learning with social learning across generations, achieve emergent cultural accumulation surpassing single-lifetime learning. Two models, representing in-context (knowledge) and in-weights (skill) accumulation, are presented to illustrate this novel approach to open-ended learning."

    "title": "Effects of AI Feedback on Learning, the Skill Gap, and Intellectual Diversity",
    "published_date": "2024-09-27",
    "abstract": "Can human decision-makers learn from AI feedback? Using data on 52,000 decision-makers from a large online chess platform, we investigate how their AI use affects three interrelated long-term outcomes: Learning, skill gap, and diversity of decision strategies. First, we show that individuals are far more likely to seek AI feedback in situations in which they experienced success rather than failure. This AI feedback seeking strategy turns out to be detrimental to learning: Feedback on successes decreases future performance, while feedback on failures increases it. Second, higher-skilled decision-makers seek AI feedback more often and are far more likely to seek AI feedback after a failure, and benefit more from AI feedback than lower-skilled individuals. As a result, access to AI feedback increases, rather than decreases, the skill gap between high- and low-skilled individuals. Finally, we leverage 42 major platform updates as natural experiments to show that access to AI feedback causes a decrease in intellectual diversity of the population as individuals tend to specialize in the same areas. Together, those results indicate that learning from AI feedback is not automatic and using AI correctly seems to be a skill itself. Furthermore, despite its individual-level benefits, access to AI feedback can have significant population-level downsides including loss of intellectual diversity and an increasing skill gap.",
    "summary": "A study of 52,000 online chess players reveals that while AI feedback improves performance when sought after failures, seeking it after successes hinders learning and exacerbates skill gaps; furthermore, increased AI access reduces intellectual diversity among players."

    "published_date": "2023-11-14",
    "abstract": "What will likely be the effect of the emergence of ChatGPT and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI) on the skill premium? To address this question, we develop a nested constant elasticity of substitution production function that distinguishes between industrial robots and AI. Industrial robots predominantly substitute for low-skill workers, whereas AI mainly helps to perform the tasks of high-skill workers. We show that AI reduces the skill premium as long as it is more substitutable for high-skill workers than low-skill workers are for high-skill workers.",

    "summary": "This paper models the impact of AI on the skill premium using a nested CES production function, finding that AI reduces the skill premium if it substitutes more easily for high-skill workers than low-skill workers do."

    "title": "Allocating Opportunities in a Dynamic Model of Intergenerational Mobility",
    "published_date": "2021-01-21",
    "abstract": "Opportunities such as higher education can promote intergenerational mobility, leading individuals to achieve levels of socioeconomic status above that of their parents. We develop a dynamic model for allocating such opportunities in a society that exhibits bottlenecks in mobility; the problem of optimal allocation reflects a trade-off between the benefits conferred by the opportunities in the current generation and the potential to elevate the socioeconomic status of recipients, shaping the composition of future generations in ways that can benefit further from the opportunities. We show how optimal allocations in our model arise as solutions to continuous optimization problems over multiple generations, and we find in general that these optimal solutions can favor recipients of low socioeconomic status over slightly higher-performing individuals of high socioeconomic status --- a form of socioeconomic affirmative action that the society in our model discovers in the pursuit of purely payoff-maximizing goals. We characterize how the structure of the model can lead to either temporary or persistent affirmative action, and we consider extensions of the model with more complex processes modulating the movement between different levels of socioeconomic status.",
    "citation_count": 16,
    "summary": "This paper models optimal allocation of opportunities (e.g., higher education) to maximize intergenerational socioeconomic mobility, finding that maximizing long-term societal benefit often necessitates prioritizing low socioeconomic status individuals over slightly higher-performing, higher socioeconomic status individuals, thus revealing a form of affirmative action as a payoff-maximizing strategy. The model explores conditions leading to temporary versus persistent affirmative action policies."

    "title": "Learning to solve complex tasks by growing knowledge culturally across generations",
    "published_date": "2021-07-28",
    "abstract": "Knowledge built culturally across generations allows humans to learn far more than an individual could glean from their own experience in a lifetime. Cultural knowledge in turn rests on language: language is the richest record of what previous generations believed, valued, and practiced, and how these evolved over time. The power and mechanisms of language as a means of cultural learning, however, are not well understood, and as a result, current AI systems do not leverage language as a means for cultural knowledge transmission. Here, we take a first step towards reverse-engineering cultural learning through language. We developed a suite of complex tasks in the form of minimalist-style video games, which we deployed in an iterated learning paradigm. Human participants were limited to only two attempts (two lives) to beat each game and were allowed to write a message to a future participant who read the message before playing. Knowledge accumulated gradually across generations, allowing later generations to advance further in the games and perform more efficient actions. Multigenerational learning followed a strikingly similar trajectory to individuals learning alone with an unlimited number of lives. Successive generations of learners were able to succeed by expressing distinct types of knowledge in natural language: the dynamics of the environment, valuable goals, dangerous risks, and strategies for success. The video game paradigm we pioneer here is thus a rich test bed for developing AI systems capable of acquiring and transmitting cultural knowledge.",
    "citation_count": 7,
    "summary": "This study demonstrates human cultural learning through a multi-generational video game experiment, showing how knowledge transmitted via natural language messages across generations enables problem-solving success comparable to individuals with unlimited learning attempts. This paradigm serves as a model for developing AI systems capable of cultural knowledge acquisition and transmission."

    "title": "Procedural Content Generation: Better Benchmarks for Transfer Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2021-05-31",
    "abstract": "The idea of transfer in reinforcement learning (TRL) is intriguing: being able to transfer knowledge from one problem to another problem without learning everything from scratch. This promises quicker learning and learning more complex methods. To gain an insight into the field and to detect emerging trends, we performed a database search. We note a surprisingly late adoption of deep learning that starts in 2018. The introduction of deep learning has not yet solved the greatest challenge of TRL: generalization. Transfer between different domains works well when domains have strong similarities (e.g. MountainCar to Cartpole), and most TRL publications focus on different tasks within the same domain that have few differences. Most TRL applications we encountered compare their improvements against self-defined baselines, and the field is still missing unified benchmarks. We consider this to be a disappointing situation. For the future, we note that: (1) A clear measure of task similarity is needed. (2) Generalization needs to improve. Promising approaches merge deep learning with planning via MCTS or introduce memory through LSTMs. (3) The lack of benchmarking tools will be remedied to enable meaningful comparison and measure progress. Already Alchemy and Meta-World are emerging as interesting benchmark suites. We note that another development, the increase in procedural content generation (PCG), can improve both benchmarking and generalization in TRL.",

    "summary": "This paper analyzes the current state of transfer reinforcement learning (TRL), highlighting the limited progress in generalization and the lack of standardized benchmarks. The authors propose that procedural content generation (PCG) can significantly improve both benchmarking and generalization capabilities within TRL."
