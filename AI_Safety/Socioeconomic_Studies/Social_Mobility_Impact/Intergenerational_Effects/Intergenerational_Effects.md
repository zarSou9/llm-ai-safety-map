### Mini Description

Investigation of how AI deployment affects the transmission of economic and social advantages between generations

### Description

Intergenerational effects research examines how AI technologies influence the transmission of economic, social, and cultural capital across generations. This includes studying how AI-driven changes in education, employment, wealth accumulation, and social networks affect parents' ability to provide advantages to their children. The research considers both direct mechanisms, such as how AI impacts inheritance and educational investments, and indirect mechanisms, like how AI-induced economic restructuring affects family stability and parental resources.

A key focus is understanding how AI technologies may create new forms of inherited advantage or disadvantage. This includes examining how early exposure to AI tools, access to AI-enhanced educational resources, and familial tech-literacy shape children's future opportunities. Researchers analyze how AI deployment in various sectors might amplify or mitigate existing patterns of intergenerational privilege transmission, particularly through changes in labor market returns to different forms of human capital.

Methodologically, this field combines longitudinal studies tracking multiple generations with economic modeling of inheritance mechanisms and sociological analysis of family dynamics. Researchers examine how AI affects traditional mobility drivers like education and wealth while also investigating novel transmission channels unique to the AI era. Central challenges include measuring long-term effects given AI's relatively recent emergence and distinguishing AI-specific impacts from broader technological trends.
