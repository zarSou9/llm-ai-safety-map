    "title": "Generative AI Triggers Welfare-Reducing Decisions in Humans",
    "published_date": "2024-01-23",
    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape the way individuals communicate and interact. While this form of AI has the potential to efficiently make numerous human decisions, there is limited understanding of how individuals respond to its use in social interaction. In particular, it remains unclear how individuals engage with algorithms when the interaction entails consequences for other people. Here, we report the results of a large-scale pre-registered online experiment (N = 3,552) indicating diminished fairness, trust, trustworthiness, cooperation, and coordination by human players in economic twoplayer games, when the decision of the interaction partner is taken over by ChatGPT. On the contrary, we observe no adverse welfare effects when individuals are uncertain about whether they are interacting with a human or generative AI. Therefore, the promotion of AI transparency, often suggested as a solution to mitigate the negative impacts of generative AI on society, shows a detrimental effect on welfare in our study. Concurrently, participants frequently delegate decisions to ChatGPT, particularly when the AI's involvement is undisclosed, and individuals struggle to discern between AI and human decisions.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence, Income Distribution and Economic Growth",
    "abstract": "The economic impact of Articial Intelligence (AI) is studied using a (semi) endogenous growth model with two novel features. First, the task approach from labor economics is reformulated and integrated into a growth model. Second, the standard representative household assumption is rejected, so that aggregate demand restrictions can be introduced. With these novel features it is shown that (i) AI automation can decrease the share of labor income no matter the size of the elasticity of substitution between AI and labor, and (ii) when this elasticity is high, AI will unambiguously reduce aggregate demand and slow down GDP growth, even in the face of the positive technology shock that AI entails. If the elasticity of substitution is low, then GDP, productivity and wage growth may however still slow down, because the economy will then fail to benefit from the supply-side driven capacity expansion potential that AI can deliver. The model can thus explain why advanced countries tend to experience, despite much AI hype, the simultaneous existence of rather high employment with stagnating wages, productivity, and GDP.",

    "summary": "A new growth model incorporating AI automation and heterogeneous households demonstrates that AI can reduce labor income share regardless of the AI-labor substitution elasticity, and may slow GDP growth, particularly when this elasticity is high, due to decreased aggregate demand despite AI's positive technology shock. Even with low elasticity, GDP, productivity, and wage growth may stagnate due to underutilized AI-driven capacity expansion."

    "title": "Labour and technology at the time of Covid-19. Can artificial intelligence mitigate the need for proximity?",
    "abstract": "Social distancing has become worldwide the key public policy to be implemented during the COVID-19 epidemic and reducing the degree of proximity among workers turned out to be an important dimension. An emerging literature looks at the role of automation in supporting the work of humans but the potential of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to inﬂuence the need for physical proximity on the workplace has been left largely unexplored. By using a unique and innovative dataset that combines data on advancements of AI at the occupational level with information on the required proximity in the job-place and administrative employer-employee data on job ﬂows, our results show that AI and proximity stand in an inverse U-shape relationship at the sectoral level, with high advancements in AI that are negatively associated with proximity. We detect this pattern among sectors that were closed due to the lockdown measures as well as among sectors that remained open. We argue that, apart from the expected gains in productivity and competitiveness, preserving jobs and economic activities in a situation of high contagion may be the additional beneﬁts of a policy favouring digitization.",

The authors suggest that promoting AI-driven digitization can boost productivity, competitiveness, and job preservation during outbreaks."

    "title": "The impact of generative artificial intelligence on socioeconomic inequalities and policy making",
    "published_date": "2023-12-16",
    "abstract": "Abstract Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to both exacerbate and ameliorate existing socioeconomic inequalities. In this article, we provide a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary overview of the potential impacts of generative AI on (mis)information and three information-intensive domains: work, education, and healthcare. Our goal is to highlight how generative AI could worsen existing inequalities while illuminating how AI may help mitigate pervasive social problems. In the information domain, generative AI can democratize content creation and access but may dramatically expand the production and proliferation of misinformation. In the workplace, it can boost productivity and create new jobs, but the benefits will likely be distributed unevenly. In education, it offers personalized learning, but may widen the digital divide. In healthcare, it might improve diagnostics and accessibility, but could deepen pre-existing inequalities. In each section, we cover a specific topic, evaluate existing research, identify critical gaps, and recommend research directions, including explicit trade-offs that complicate the derivation of a priori hypotheses. We conclude with a section highlighting the role of policymaking to maximize generative AI's potential to reduce inequalities while mitigating its harmful effects. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of existing policy frameworks in the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, observing that each fails to fully confront the socioeconomic challenges we have identified. We propose several concrete policies that could promote shared prosperity through the advancement of generative AI. This article emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaborations to understand and address the complex challenges of generative AI.",

    "summary": "Generative AI's impact on socioeconomic inequality is complex, potentially exacerbating disparities in information access, work, education, and healthcare while also offering opportunities for mitigation. Effective policy interventions are crucial to maximize benefits and minimize harms, requiring interdisciplinary collaboration and addressing shortcomings in existing frameworks."

    "published_date": "2023-04-01",
    "abstract": "We study the staggered introduction of a generative AI-based conversational assistant using data from 5,172 customer support agents. Access to AI assistance increases worker productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 15\\% on average, with substantial heterogeneity across workers. Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve both the speed and quality of their output while the most experienced and highest-skilled workers see small gains in speed and small declines in quality. We also find evidence that AI assistance facilitates worker learning and improves English fluency, particularly among international agents. While AI systems improve with more training data, we find that the gains from AI adoption are largest for relatively rare problems, where human agents have less baseline training and experience. Finally, we provide evidence that AI assistance improves the experience of work along two key dimensions: customers are more polite and less likely to ask to speak to a manager.",

    "title": "The long-term effect of childhood exposure to technology using surrogates",
    "published_date": "2022-12-06",
    "abstract": "We study how childhood exposure to technology at ages 5-15 via the occupation of the parents affects the ability to climb the social ladder in terms of income at ages 45-49 using the Danish micro data from years 19612019. Our measure of technology exposure covers the degree to which using computers (hardware and software) is required to perform an occupation, and it is created by merging occupational codes with detailed data from O*NET. The challenge in estimating this effect is that long-term outcome is observed over a different time horizon than our treatment of interest. We therefore adapt the surrogate index methodology, linking the effect of our childhood treatment on intermediate surrogates, such as income and education at ages 25-29, to the effect on adulthood income. We estimate that a one standard error increase in exposure to technology increases the income rank by 2%-points, which is economically and statistically significant and robust to cluster-correlation within families. The derived policy recommendation is to update the educational curriculum to expose children to computers to a higher degree, which may then act as a social leveler.",
    "summary": "Using Danish data (1961-2019), this study finds a significant positive correlation between childhood exposure to technology (measured via parental occupation) and later-life income rank, suggesting that increased technological exposure in education could promote social mobility. The analysis leverages a surrogate index methodology to connect childhood exposure to later outcomes."

    "title": "Allocating Opportunities in a Dynamic Model of Intergenerational Mobility",
    "published_date": "2021-01-21",
    "abstract": "Opportunities such as higher education can promote intergenerational mobility, leading individuals to achieve levels of socioeconomic status above that of their parents. We develop a dynamic model for allocating such opportunities in a society that exhibits bottlenecks in mobility; the problem of optimal allocation reflects a trade-off between the benefits conferred by the opportunities in the current generation and the potential to elevate the socioeconomic status of recipients, shaping the composition of future generations in ways that can benefit further from the opportunities. We show how optimal allocations in our model arise as solutions to continuous optimization problems over multiple generations, and we find in general that these optimal solutions can favor recipients of low socioeconomic status over slightly higher-performing individuals of high socioeconomic status --- a form of socioeconomic affirmative action that the society in our model discovers in the pursuit of purely payoff-maximizing goals. We characterize how the structure of the model can lead to either temporary or persistent affirmative action, and we consider extensions of the model with more complex processes modulating the movement between different levels of socioeconomic status.",
    "citation_count": 16,
    "summary": "A dynamic model demonstrates that optimally allocating opportunities, like higher education, to maximize societal benefit across generations often favors individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, even over slightly higher-performing individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, effectively implementing a form of affirmative action. This preferential allocation can be temporary or persistent depending on model parameters."

    "published_date": "2021-07-20",
    "abstract": "This paper considers identification and estimation of distributional effect parameters that depend on the joint distribution of an outcome and another variable of interest (\"treatment\") in a setting with\"two-sided\"measurement error -- that is, where both variables are possibly measured with error. Examples of these parameters in the context of intergenerational income mobility include transition matrices, rank-rank correlations, and the poverty rate of children as a function of their parents' income, among others. Building on recent work on quantile regression (QR) with measurement error in the outcome (particularly, Hausman, Liu, Luo, and Palmer (2021)), we show that, given (i) two linear QR models separately for the outcome and treatment conditional on other observed covariates and (ii) assumptions about the measurement error for each variable, one can recover the joint distribution of the outcome and the treatment. Besides these conditions, our approach does not require an instrument, repeated measurements, or distributional assumptions about the measurement error. Using recent data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Study of Youth, we find that accounting for measurement error notably reduces several estimates of intergenerational mobility parameters.",
    "summary": "This paper develops an approach to identify and estimate distributional effects when both outcome and treatment variables are measured with error, applying it to intergenerational income mobility. The method uses two linear quantile regression models and assumptions about the measurement error to recover the joint distribution of the unobserved true variables, without requiring instruments or repeated measurements."
