### Mini Description

Analysis of how AI influences traditional and emerging forms of intergenerational wealth and resource transfer, including both financial and non-financial assets

### Description

Capital transfer mechanisms research examines how AI technologies reshape traditional and create novel pathways for transferring economic and social resources between generations. This includes studying how AI affects inheritance patterns, investment strategies, and the relative importance of different forms of capital transmission. The research analyzes both explicit transfers (like financial inheritance and educational investments) and implicit transfers (such as access to AI-enhanced networks and opportunities).

A key focus is understanding how AI technologies create new forms of transferable advantage, such as proprietary AI systems, datasets, or algorithmic innovations that can be passed down within families or organizations. This includes examining how early access to AI tools and platforms might create compounding advantages, and how AI-driven changes in asset valuation and wealth creation affect traditional inheritance mechanisms. Researchers also investigate how AI influences the effectiveness of different transfer strategies, from direct resource allocation to investment in human capital development.

Methodologically, the field combines economic modeling of wealth transfer dynamics with empirical studies of how families and organizations adapt their transfer strategies in response to AI advancement. This includes developing frameworks for valuing AI-specific assets, analyzing changes in intergenerational wealth preservation strategies, and studying how different social groups' access to AI-enhanced transfer mechanisms affects long-term inequality. A central challenge is anticipating how continued AI development might fundamentally alter the nature and importance of different forms of capital transfer.
