    "title": "Socio-spatial segregation and human mobility: A review of empirical evidence",
    "published_date": "2024-03-11",
    "abstract": "Socio-spatial segregation is the physical separation of different social, economic, or demographic groups within a geographic space, often resulting in unequal access to resources, services, and opportunities. The literature has traditionally focused on residential segregation, examining how individuals' residential locations are distributed differently across neighborhoods based on various social attributes, e.g., race, ethnicity, and income. However, this approach overlooks the complexity of spatial segregation in people's daily activities, which often extend far beyond residential areas. Since the 2010s, emerging mobility data sources have enabled a new understanding of socio-spatial segregation by considering daily activities such as work, school, shopping, and leisure visits. From traditional surveys to GPS trajectories, diverse data sources reveal that daily mobility can result in spatial segregation levels that differ from those observed in residential segregation. This literature review focuses on three critical questions: (a) What are the strengths and limitations of segregation research incorporating extensive mobility data? (b) How do human mobility patterns relate to individuals' residential vs. experienced segregation levels? and (c) What key factors explain the relationship between one's mobility patterns and experienced segregation? Our literature review enhances the understanding of socio-spatial segregation at the individual level and clarifies core concepts and methodological challenges in the field. Our review explores studies of key themes: segregation, activity space, co-presence, and the built environment. By synthesizing their findings, we aim to offer actionable insights for reducing segregation.",

    "title": "Disentangling individual-level from location-based income uncovers socioeconomic preferential mobility and impacts segregation estimates",
    "published_date": "2024-07-01",
    "abstract": "Segregation encodes information about society, such as social cohesion, mixing, and inequality. However, most past and current studies tackled socioeconomic (SE) segregation by analyzing static aggregated mobility networks, often without considering further individual features beyond income and, most importantly, without distinguishing individual-level from location-based income. Accessing individual-level income may help mapping macroscopic behavior into more granular mobility patterns, hence impacting segregation estimates. Here we combine a mobile phone dataset of daily mobility flows across Spanish districts stratified and adjusted by age, gender and income with census data of districts median income. We build mobility-based SE assortativity matrices for multiple demographics and observe mobility patterns of three income groups with respect to location-based SE classes. We find that SE assortativity differs when isolating the mobility of specific income groups: we observe that groups prefer to visit areas with higher average income than their own, which we call preferential mobility. Our analysis suggests substantial differences between weekdays and weekends SE assortativity by age class, with weekends characterized by higher SE assortativity. Our modeling approach shows that the radiation model, which typically performs best at reproducing inter-municipal population mobility, best fits middle income and middle-aged flows, while performing worse on young and low income groups. Our double-sided approach, focusing on assortativity patterns and mobility modeling, suggests that state of the art mobility models fail at capturing preferential mobility behavior. Overall, our work indicates that mobility models considering the interplay of SE preferential behavior, age and gender gaps may sensibly improve the state of the art models performance.",
    "summary": "By analyzing mobile phone data and census data in Spain, researchers found that socioeconomic segregation estimates are significantly affected by individuals' preferential mobility towards higher-income areas, a pattern not fully captured by existing mobility models, highlighting the importance of considering individual-level income and mobility preferences in segregation studies."

    "title": "The Effect of Limited Mobility on the Experienced Segregation of Foreign-born Minorities",
    "published_date": "2024-06-29",
    "abstract": "Segregation is a key challenge in promoting more diverse and inclusive cities. Research based on large-scale mobility data indicates that segregation between majority and minority groups persists in daily activities beyond residential areas, like visiting shops and restaurants. Aspects including lifestyle differences, homophily, and mobility constraints have been proposed as drivers of this phenomenon, but their contributions remain poorly quantified. Here, we elucidate how different mechanisms influence segregation outside home, looking at the distinctive segregation experienced by native and foreign-born individuals. Our study is based on the movement of ~320,000 individual smartphone devices collected in Sweden, where immigration creates profound divides. We find that while day-to-day activities lead to mixing for native-born individuals, foreign-born individuals remain segregated in their out-of-home activities. Using counterfactual simulations, we show that this heterogeneous effect of mobility on experienced segregation results mainly from two mechanisms: homophily and limited travel, i.e. foreign-born individuals (i) tend to visit destinations visited by similar individuals, and (ii) have limited mobility ranges. We show that homophily, as represented by destination preference, plays a minor role, while limited mobility, associated with reduced transport access, limits opportunities for foreign-born minorities to diversify their encounters. Our findings suggest that enhancing transport accessibility in foreign-born concentrated areas could reduce social segregation.",
    "citation_count": 2,
    "summary": "Using smartphone mobility data from Sweden, researchers found that foreign-born individuals experience greater segregation than native-born individuals in their daily activities, primarily due to limited mobility rather than homophily; improving transport access in immigrant-concentrated areas could mitigate this segregation."

    "title": "The impact of generative artificial intelligence on socioeconomic inequalities and policy making",
    "published_date": "2023-12-16",
    "abstract": "Abstract Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to both exacerbate and ameliorate existing socioeconomic inequalities. In this article, we provide a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary overview of the potential impacts of generative AI on (mis)information and three information-intensive domains: work, education, and healthcare. Our goal is to highlight how generative AI could worsen existing inequalities while illuminating how AI may help mitigate pervasive social problems. In the information domain, generative AI can democratize content creation and access but may dramatically expand the production and proliferation of misinformation. In the workplace, it can boost productivity and create new jobs, but the benefits will likely be distributed unevenly. In education, it offers personalized learning, but may widen the digital divide. In healthcare, it might improve diagnostics and accessibility, but could deepen pre-existing inequalities. In each section, we cover a specific topic, evaluate existing research, identify critical gaps, and recommend research directions, including explicit trade-offs that complicate the derivation of a priori hypotheses. We conclude with a section highlighting the role of policymaking to maximize generative AI's potential to reduce inequalities while mitigating its harmful effects. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of existing policy frameworks in the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, observing that each fails to fully confront the socioeconomic challenges we have identified. We propose several concrete policies that could promote shared prosperity through the advancement of generative AI. This article emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaborations to understand and address the complex challenges of generative AI.",

    "title": "Allocating Opportunities in a Dynamic Model of Intergenerational Mobility",
    "published_date": "2021-01-21",
    "abstract": "Opportunities such as higher education can promote intergenerational mobility, leading individuals to achieve levels of socioeconomic status above that of their parents. We develop a dynamic model for allocating such opportunities in a society that exhibits bottlenecks in mobility; the problem of optimal allocation reflects a trade-off between the benefits conferred by the opportunities in the current generation and the potential to elevate the socioeconomic status of recipients, shaping the composition of future generations in ways that can benefit further from the opportunities. We show how optimal allocations in our model arise as solutions to continuous optimization problems over multiple generations, and we find in general that these optimal solutions can favor recipients of low socioeconomic status over slightly higher-performing individuals of high socioeconomic status --- a form of socioeconomic affirmative action that the society in our model discovers in the pursuit of purely payoff-maximizing goals. We characterize how the structure of the model can lead to either temporary or persistent affirmative action, and we consider extensions of the model with more complex processes modulating the movement between different levels of socioeconomic status.",

    "title": "Disaggregated Interventions to Reduce Inequality",
    "published_date": "2021-07-01",
    "abstract": "A significant body of research in the data sciences considers unfair discrimination against social categories such as race or gender that could occur or be amplified as a result of algorithmic decisions. Simultaneously, real-world disparities continue to exist, even before algorithmic decisions are made. In this work, we draw on insights from the social sciences brought into the realm of causal modeling and constrained optimization, and develop a novel algorithmic framework for tackling pre-existing real-world disparities. The purpose of our framework, which we call the “impact remediation framework,” is to measure real-world disparities and discover the optimal intervention policies that could help improve equity or access to opportunity for those who are underserved with respect to an outcome of interest. We develop a disaggregated approach to tackling pre-existing disparities that relaxes the typical set of assumptions required for the use of social categories in structural causal models. Our approach flexibly incorporates counterfactuals and is compatible with various ontological assumptions about the nature of social categories. We demonstrate impact remediation with a hypothetical case study and compare our disaggregated approach to an existing state-of-the-art approach, comparing its structure and resulting policy recommendations. In contrast to most work on optimal policy learning, we explore disparity reduction itself as an objective, explicitly focusing the power of algorithms on reducing inequality.",

    "published_date": "2021-08-10",
    "abstract": "Although the fairness community has recognized the importance of data, researchers in the area primarily rely on UCI Adult when it comes to tabular data. Derived from a 1994 US Census survey, this dataset has appeared in hundreds of research papers where it served as the basis for the development and comparison of many algorithmic fairness interventions. We reconstruct a superset of the UCI Adult data from available US Census sources and reveal idiosyncrasies of the UCI Adult dataset that limit its external validity. Our primary contribution is a suite of new datasets derived from US Census surveys that extend the existing data ecosystem for research on fair machine learning. We create prediction tasks relating to income, employment, health, transportation, and housing. The data span multiple years and all states of the United States, allowing researchers to study temporal shift and geographic variation. We highlight a broad initial sweep of new empirical insights relating to trade-offs between fairness criteria, performance of algorithmic interventions, and the role of distribution shift based on our new datasets. Our findings inform ongoing debates, challenge some existing narratives, and point to future research directions. Our datasets are available at https://github.com/zykls/folktables.",

    "abstract": "Sociotechnical systems within cities are now equipped with machine learning algorithms in hopes to increase efficiency and functionality by modeling and predicting trends. Machine learning algorithms have been applied in these domains to address challenges such as balancing the distribution of bikes throughout a city and identifying demand hotspots for ride sharing drivers. However, these algorithms applied to challenges in sociotechnical systems have exacerbated social inequalities due to previous bias in data sets or the lack of data from marginalized communities. In this paper, I will address how smart mobility initiatives in cities use machine learning algorithms to address challenges. I will also address how these algorithms unintentionally discriminate against features such as socioeconomic status to motivate the importance of algorithmic fairness. Using the bike sharing program in Pittsburgh, PA, I will present a position on how discrimination can be eliminated from the pipeline using Bayesian Optimization.",

    "abstract": "Social mobility captures the extent to which socio-economic status of children, is independent of status of their respective parents. In order to measure social mobility, most widely used indicators of socio-economic status are income, education and occupation. While social mobility measurement based on income is less contested, data availability in Indian context limits us to observing mobility patterns along the dimensions of either education or occupation. In this study we observe social mobility patterns for different social groups along these two main dimensions, and find that while upward and downward mobility prospects in education for SCs/STs is somewhat improving in the recent times, occupational mobility patterns are rather worrisome. These results motivate the need for reconciling disparate trends along education and occupation, in order to get a more comprehensive picture of social mobility in the country.",
