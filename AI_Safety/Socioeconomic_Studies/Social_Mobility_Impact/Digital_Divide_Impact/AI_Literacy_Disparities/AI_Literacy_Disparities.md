### Mini Description

Study of variations in understanding, ability to use, and capacity to critically evaluate AI systems across different populations

### Description

AI literacy disparities research examines variations in individuals' and groups' capabilities to understand, effectively utilize, and critically evaluate AI systems. This encompasses studying how different populations comprehend AI concepts, interact with AI-powered tools, and navigate AI-mediated environments. The field analyzes disparities across multiple dimensions, including technical understanding, practical application skills, and critical awareness of AI's limitations and implications.

Researchers investigate how AI literacy gaps emerge from various factors, including educational background, cultural context, age, and prior technology exposure. This includes studying how different learning approaches and mental models affect AI comprehension, how various populations interpret AI outputs and capabilities, and how misconceptions about AI systems influence interaction patterns. A key focus is understanding how these literacy disparities create downstream effects in educational and professional contexts.

Methodologically, the field combines cognitive science approaches to measure AI understanding, educational research to evaluate learning outcomes, and sociological analysis to contextualize literacy patterns. Researchers develop assessment frameworks for measuring AI literacy levels, study the effectiveness of different educational interventions, and investigate how varying levels of AI literacy affect decision-making and technology adoption. Current challenges include developing standardized measures of AI literacy, understanding how literacy requirements evolve with advancing AI capabilities, and designing inclusive educational approaches that address diverse learning needs.
