### Mini Description

Study of how different groups and communities integrate AI technologies into their lives and work, including barriers to adoption and usage patterns

### Description

Adoption pattern analysis in the context of AI digital divides examines how different social groups, organizations, and communities incorporate AI technologies into their daily lives and operations. This research area tracks the temporal dynamics of AI adoption, identifying barriers, enablers, and variations in usage patterns across different demographic segments. Key focus areas include understanding the roles of social networks, cultural factors, and institutional support in shaping adoption decisions and subsequent usage behaviors.

Researchers employ mixed-method approaches, combining quantitative diffusion models with ethnographic studies to capture both macro-level adoption trends and micro-level decision processes. This includes analyzing how early adopters influence broader community adoption, how different groups adapt and repurpose AI technologies for their specific needs, and how adoption patterns vary across different types of AI applications. Special attention is paid to understanding resistance factors, abandonment patterns, and the development of workaround practices when AI technologies don't align with user needs or values.

A critical aspect of this research involves examining how adoption patterns contribute to or mitigate digital divides. This includes studying how different adoption trajectories lead to varying levels of technological integration and benefit realization, and how these differences manifest across socioeconomic, cultural, and geographic boundaries. Researchers also investigate how organizational policies, community initiatives, and peer influences shape adoption decisions and subsequent usage patterns, with implications for intervention design and policy development.
