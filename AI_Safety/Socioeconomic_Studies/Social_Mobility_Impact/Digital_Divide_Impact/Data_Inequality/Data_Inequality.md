### Mini Description

Investigation of how disparities in data availability, quality, and representation affect different groups' ability to benefit from AI systems

### Description

Data inequality research examines how disparities in data collection, representation, and utilization across different populations affect the development and impact of AI systems. This encompasses studying how historical biases in data collection, varying levels of digital footprint generation, and differences in data quality create systematic advantages or disadvantages for different demographic groups. The field analyzes both active data collection disparities, where certain populations are undersampled or misrepresented, and passive disparities arising from differential rates of technology adoption and digital service usage.

A key focus is understanding how data inequalities propagate through AI system development and deployment. This includes examining how training data imbalances affect model performance across different populations, how varying levels of data granularity impact service quality, and how data privacy concerns and regulations differently affect various groups' representation in datasets. Researchers investigate both direct effects, such as reduced model accuracy for underrepresented groups, and indirect effects, like the reinforcement of existing biases through feedback loops in AI systems.

Methodologically, the field combines quantitative analysis of dataset compositions and model performance with qualitative studies of data collection practices and their societal implications. Researchers develop metrics for measuring data representation and quality across different populations, study the economic and social impacts of data inequalities, and evaluate interventions aimed at achieving more equitable data collection and utilization. Central challenges include balancing privacy rights with representation needs, addressing historical data collection biases, and ensuring ethical data collection practices while maintaining dataset utility.
