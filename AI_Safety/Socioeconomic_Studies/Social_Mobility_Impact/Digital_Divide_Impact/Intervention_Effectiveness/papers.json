    "title": "The Emerging AI Divide in the United States",
    "published_date": "2024-04-18",
    "abstract": "The digital divide describes disparities in access to and usage of digital tooling between social and economic groups. Emerging generative artificial intelligence tools, which strongly affect productivity, could magnify the impact of these divides. However, the affordability, multi-modality, and multilingual capabilities of these tools could also make them more accessible to diverse users in comparison with previous forms of digital tooling. In this study, we characterize spatial differences in U.S. residents' knowledge of a new generative AI tool, ChatGPT, through an analysis of state- and county-level search query data. In the first six months after the tool's release, we observe the highest rates of users searching for ChatGPT in West Coast states and persistently low rates of search in Appalachian and Gulf states. Counties with the highest rates of search are relatively more urbanized and have proportionally more educated, more economically advantaged, and more Asian residents in comparison with other counties or with the U.S. average. In multilevel models adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as industry makeup, education is the strongest positive predictor of rates of search for generative AI tooling. Although generative AI technologies may be novel, early differences in uptake appear to be following familiar paths of digital marginalization.",

    "summary": "Analysis of ChatGPT search data reveals a widening AI divide in the US, with higher search rates concentrated in wealthier, more urban, and better-educated areas, suggesting that existing socioeconomic disparities are influencing access to and knowledge of this emerging technology. This mirrors previous patterns of digital marginalization."

    "title": "Effective and Scalable Math Support: Evidence on the Impact of an AI- Tutor on Math Achievement in Ghana",
    "published_date": "2024-02-15",
    "abstract": "This study evaluates the impact of Rori, an AI powered conversational math tutor accessible via WhatsApp, on the math performance of approximately 1,000 students in grades 3-9 across 11 schools in Ghana. Each school was assigned to a treatment group or control group; the students in the control group continued their regular math instruction, while students in the treatment group engaged with Rori, for two 30-minute sessions per week over 8 months in addition to regular math instruction. We find that the math growth scores were substantially higher for the treatment group with an effect size of 0.37, and that the results were statistically significant (p<0.001). The fact that Rori works with basic mobile devices on low-bandwidth data networks gives the intervention strong potential to support personalized learning on other low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), where laptop ownership and high-speed internet - prerequisite for many video-centered learning platforms - remain extremely limited. While the results should be interpreted judiciously, as they only report on year 1 of the intervention, and future research is necessary to better understand which conditions are necessary for successful implementation, they do suggest that chat-based tutoring solutions leveraging artificial intelligence could offer a costeffective approach to enhancing learning outcomes for millions of students globally.",

    "summary": "A study in Ghana showed that using Rori, an AI-powered math tutor accessible via WhatsApp, significantly improved math performance among students in grades 3-9 (effect size 0.37, p<0.001), suggesting a cost-effective approach to enhancing learning outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. This success highlights the potential of chat-based AI tutoring, despite limitations in technology access."

    "title": "AI Chat Assistants can Improve Conversations about Divisive Topics",
    "published_date": "2023-02-14",
    "abstract": "A rapidly increasing amount of human conversation occurs online. But divisiveness and conflict can fester in text-based interactions on social media platforms, in messaging apps, and on other digital forums. Such toxicity increases polarization and, importantly, corrodes the capacity of diverse societies to develop efficient solutions to complex social problems that impact everyone. Scholars and civil society groups promote interventions that can make interpersonal conversations less divisive or more productive in offline settings, but scaling these efforts to the amount of discourse that occurs online is extremely challenging. We present results of a large-scale experiment that demonstrates how online conversations about divisive topics can be improved with artificial intelligence tools. Specifically, we employ a large language model to make real-time, evidence-based recommendations intended to improve participants' perception of feeling understood in conversations. We find that these interventions improve the reported quality of the conversation, reduce political divisiveness, and improve the tone, without systematically changing the content of the conversation or moving people's policy attitudes. These findings have important implications for future research on social media, political deliberation, and the growing community of scholars interested in the place of artificial intelligence within computational social science.",
    "summary": "This study shows that AI-powered chat assistants can enhance online conversations about divisive topics by improving participants' feelings of understanding and the overall conversation quality, reducing political divisiveness without altering content or opinions. This suggests a potential for AI to mitigate online toxicity and improve social discourse."

    "title": "Bridging the Digital Divide: Performance Variation across Socio-Economic Factors in Vision-Language Models",
    "published_date": "2023-11-09",
    "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance of current AI models reported across various tasks, performance reports often do not include evaluations of how these models perform on the specific groups that will be impacted by these technologies. Among the minority groups under-represented in AI, data from low-income households are often overlooked in data collection and model evaluation. We evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art vision-language model (CLIP) on a geo-diverse dataset containing household images associated with different income values (Dollar Street) and show that performance inequality exists among households of different income levels. Our results indicate that performance for the poorer groups is consistently lower than the wealthier groups across various topics and countries. We highlight insights that can help mitigate these issues and propose actionable steps for economic-level inclusive AI development. Code is available at https://github.com/MichiganNLP/Bridging_the_Digital_Divide.",

    "summary": "This study reveals performance disparities in a state-of-the-art vision-language model (CLIP) across different socioeconomic groups, finding that lower-income households consistently exhibit lower model performance compared to wealthier households. The authors highlight these inequalities and suggest strategies for developing more economically inclusive AI."

    "title": "Disaggregated Interventions to Reduce Inequality",
    "published_date": "2021-07-01",
    "abstract": "A significant body of research in the data sciences considers unfair discrimination against social categories such as race or gender that could occur or be amplified as a result of algorithmic decisions. Simultaneously, real-world disparities continue to exist, even before algorithmic decisions are made. In this work, we draw on insights from the social sciences brought into the realm of causal modeling and constrained optimization, and develop a novel algorithmic framework for tackling pre-existing real-world disparities. The purpose of our framework, which we call the “impact remediation framework,” is to measure real-world disparities and discover the optimal intervention policies that could help improve equity or access to opportunity for those who are underserved with respect to an outcome of interest. We develop a disaggregated approach to tackling pre-existing disparities that relaxes the typical set of assumptions required for the use of social categories in structural causal models. Our approach flexibly incorporates counterfactuals and is compatible with various ontological assumptions about the nature of social categories. We demonstrate impact remediation with a hypothetical case study and compare our disaggregated approach to an existing state-of-the-art approach, comparing its structure and resulting policy recommendations. In contrast to most work on optimal policy learning, we explore disparity reduction itself as an objective, explicitly focusing the power of algorithms on reducing inequality.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework, the \"impact remediation framework,\" designed to identify optimal interventions for reducing pre-existing real-world inequalities by leveraging causal modeling and a disaggregated approach that relaxes assumptions typically associated with using social categories. The framework directly targets disparity reduction as its objective, contrasting with most existing optimal policy learning methods."

    "title": "Diagnosing Data from ICTs to Provide Focused Assistance in Agricultural Adoptions",
    "published_date": "2021-10-29",
    "abstract": "In the last two decades, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have played a pivotal role in empowering rural populations in India by making knowledge more accessible. Digital Green is one such ICT that employs a participatory approach with smallholder farmers to produce instructional agricultural videos that encompass content specific to them. With the help of human mediators, they disseminate these videos to farmers using projectors to improve the adoption of agricultural practices. Digital Green's web-based data tracker (CoCo) stores the attendance and adoption logs of millions of farmers, the videos screened to them and their demographic information. In our work, we leverage this data for a period of ten years between 2010-2020 across five states in India where Digital Green is most active and use it to conduct a holistic evaluation of the ICT. First, we find disparities in the adoption rates of farmers, following which we use statistical tests to identify the different factors that lead to these disparities as well as gender-based inequalities. We find that farmers with higher adoption rates adopt videos of shorter duration and belong to smaller villages. Second, to provide assistance to farmers facing challenges, we model the adoption of practices from a video as a prediction problem and experiment with different model architectures. Our classifier achieves accuracies ranging from 79% to 90% across the five states, demonstrating its potential for assisting future ethnographic investigations. Third, we use SHAP values in conjunction with our model for explaining the impact of various network, content and demographic features on adoption. Our research finds that farmers greatly benefit from past adopters of a video from their group and village. We also discover that videos with a low content-specificity benefit some farmers more than others. Next, we highlight the implications of our findings by translating them into recommendations for providing focused assistance, community building, video screening, revisiting participatory approach and mitigating inequalities. Lastly, we conclude with a discussion on how our work can assist future investigations into the lived experiences of farmers.",
    "summary": "This study analyzes ten years of Digital Green data to identify factors influencing agricultural practice adoption among Indian farmers, revealing disparities linked to village size, video duration, and gender. The researchers then develop a predictive model (79-90% accuracy) to identify farmers needing assistance, highlighting the importance of peer influence and content specificity for successful adoption."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence in the Global South (AI4D): Potential and Risks",
    "published_date": "2021-08-23",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is becoming more widely available in all parts of the world. This has created many previously unforeseen possibilities for addressing the challenges outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals in the Global South. However, the use of AI in such contexts brings with it a unique set of risks and challenges. Among these are the potential for Governments to use such technologies to suppress their own people, and the ethical questions arising from implementing AI primarily designed and developed in the Global North into vastly different social, cultural, and political environments in the Global South. This paper examines the key issues and questions arising in the emerging sub-field of AI for global development (AI4D) and the potential and risks associated with using such technologies in the Global South. We propose that although there are many risks associated with the use of AI, the potential benefits are enough to warrant detailed research and investigation of the most appropriate and effective ways to design, develop, implement, and use such technologies in the Global South. We conclude by calling for the wider ICT4D community to continue to conduct detailed research and investigation of all aspects of AI4D.",
    "citation_count": 8,
    "summary": "The paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence to address sustainable development goals in the Global South, while highlighting significant risks including governmental misuse and ethical challenges stemming from the technology's primarily Northern origins. It advocates for further research into responsible AI development and implementation in these contexts."
