    "title": "The Intelligence Curse",
    "published_date": "2025-01-03",
    "summary": "The author argues that the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will create an \"intelligence curse,\" mirroring the \"resource curse\" of rentier states. Powerful actors, focusing on AGI's economic benefits, will lose incentives to invest in human capital, leading to societal instability and widespread unemployment as humans become economically irrelevant."

    "title": "Digital Divide: Empirical Study of CIUS 2020",
    "published_date": "2023-01-19",
    "abstract": "As Canada and other major economies consider implementing\"digital money\"or Central Bank Digital Currencies, understanding how demographic and geographic factors influence public engagement with digital technologies becomes increasingly important. This paper uses data from the 2020 Canadian Internet Use Survey and employs survey-adapted Lasso inference methods to identify individual socio-economic and demographic characteristics determining the digital divide in Canada. We also introduce a score to measure and compare the digital literacy of various segments of Canadian population. Our findings reveal that disparities in the use of e.g. online banking, emailing, and digital payments exist across different demographic and socio-economic groups. In addition, we document the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on internet use in Canada and describe changes in the characteristics of Canadian internet users over the last decade.",
    "summary": "Using data from the 2020 Canadian Internet Use Survey, this paper analyzes the Canadian digital divide, identifying socio-economic and demographic factors influencing digital technology engagement and proposing a digital literacy score to measure disparities across populations. The study also examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on internet usage in Canada."

    "title": "Measuring Corporate Digital Divide with web scraping: Evidence from Italy",
    "published_date": "2023-01-12",
    "abstract": "With the increasing pervasiveness of ICTs in the fabric of economic activities, the corporate digital divide has emerged as a new crucial topic to evaluate the IT competencies and the digital gap between ﬁrms and territories. Given the scarcity of available granular data to measure the phenomenon, most studies have used survey data. To bridge the empirical gap, we scrape the website homepage of 182 705 Italian ﬁrms, extracting ten features related to their digital footprint characteristics to develop a new corporate digital assessment index. Our results highlight a signiﬁcant digital divide across dimensions, sectors and geographical locations of Italian ﬁrms, opening up new perspectives on monitoring and near-real-time data-driven analysis.",

    "summary": "This study addresses the lack of granular data on the corporate digital divide by web scraping the homepages of 182,705 Italian firms, creating a new index to assess digital capabilities and revealing significant disparities across firms, sectors, and regions. The resulting index enables near real-time monitoring of the digital divide."

    "published_date": "2023-08-21",
    "summary": "The article discusses how Large Language Models (LLMs) are drastically increasing the censorship capabilities of authoritarian regimes, surpassing the limitations of previous methods that relied on human labor and deterrence. While past censorship strategies were inefficient and relied on targeted surveillance, LLMs enable near-universal monitoring and content filtering, creating a chilling effect and hindering organized resistance."

    "summary": "The author predicts a rapid acceleration of AI development, with transformative AI potentially arriving sooner than previously estimated, leading to scenarios like AI effectively running major corporations by 2030. This prediction is based on the accelerating pace of technological advancement and the increasing usefulness and versatility of AI, particularly transformer models."

    "title": "LIFE IN THE DIGITAL SLOW LANE: HOW DEPRIVED YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SET UP TO FAIL",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The phenomenon of digital differentiation, or stark variations in ability to access Internet hardware and/or infrastructure, has been a feature of provision since its early days. This article explores the impact of digital differentiation on two groups of young people, in England and Germany. It is based on fieldwork that took place during the academic year 2018-2019, just before the global pandemic threw the issue of equality of Internet access into sharp relief. The article begins by describing the empirical design of the My Life Online project, including background, sampling, instruments, ethical aspects and the initial data analysis approach taken to ensure reliability and validity. It then develops a further analysis drawing on Halford and Savage's hybrid Bourdieu/Actor Network Theory model (2010) to map out the socio-technical network surrounding the young people in our study. In this way we identify areas of change and conflict that compound existing social deprivation. We conclude by making a case for a better education policy awareness of the key issues, and more equitable distribution of national infrastructure moving forwards.",

    "summary": "This article examines how unequal internet access, or digital differentiation, disadvantages young people in England and Germany, exacerbating existing social deprivation and hindering their success. The study uses a mixed-methods approach to highlight the need for improved educational policies and equitable digital infrastructure."

    "title": "Digital Divide: Mapping the geodemographics of internet accessibility across Great Britain",
    "published_date": "2021-08-03",
    "abstract": "Aim: This research proposes the first solely sociodemographic measure of digital accessibility for Great Britain. Digital inaccessibility affects circa 10 million people who are unable to access or make full use of the internet, particularly impacting the disadvantaged in society. Method: A geodemographic classification is developed, analysing literature-guided sociodemographic variables at the district level. Analysis: Resultant clusters are analysed against their sociodemographic variables and spatial extent. Findings suggest three at-risk clusters exist,\"Metropolitan Minority Struggle\",\"Indian Metropolitan Living\"and\"Pakistani-Bangladeshi Inequality\". These are validated through nationwide Ofcom telecommunications performance data and specific case studies using Office for National Statistics internet usage data. Conclusion: Using solely contemporary and open-source sociodemographic variables, this paper enhances previous digital accessibility research. The identification of digitally inaccessible areas allows focussed local and national government resource and policy targeting, particularly important as a key data source and methodology post-2021, following the expected final nationwide census.",

    "summary": "This study creates a sociodemographic model identifying three digitally inaccessible groups in Great Britain (\"Metropolitan Minority Struggle,\" \"Indian Metropolitan Living,\" and \"Pakistani-Bangladeshi Inequality\"), using readily available data to inform targeted policy and resource allocation. The findings are validated using Ofcom and Office for National Statistics data."

    "title": "Of Access and Inclusivity Digital Divide in Online Education",
    "published_date": "2021-07-22",
    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has thrown the educational system of the country in disarray. The closure of schools and colleges began before the completion of the end-semester or annual exams and cast a blight on the entire academic cycle. A reinforcing web of issues, such as prolonged closure, uncertainty about the timing of reopening, likely constriction in the academic calendar and the resultant learning discontinuity among students, among others, has forced the states and educational institutions to find a feasible option to assuage the varied impacts. Online education has emerged as a preferred, predominant option. In fact, it has been pontificated to the status of TINA—there is no alternative to it. On the face of it, online education appears as a safe interim bet. Yet, its scale, scope and reach raise serious issues, both on the process preceding it and the outcome proceeding from it.",
    "citation_count": 10,
    "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a shift to online education, but this transition exposed a significant digital divide, raising concerns about equitable access and the potential for unequal educational outcomes. The paper explores the challenges and limitations of online education as a solution to pandemic-related school closures."
