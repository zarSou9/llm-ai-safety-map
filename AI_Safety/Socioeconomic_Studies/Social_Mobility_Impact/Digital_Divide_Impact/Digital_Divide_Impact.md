### Mini Description

Examination of how varying levels of access to and proficiency with AI technologies create new mobility barriers or opportunities

### Description

Digital divide impact research examines how disparities in access to, understanding of, and ability to leverage AI technologies create new dimensions of social stratification. This encompasses studying both traditional digital divides (hardware/internet access) and emerging AI-specific divides, including disparities in AI literacy, data access, and the ability to benefit from or avoid harm from AI systems. The research analyzes how these divides manifest across different demographic groups, geographic regions, and socioeconomic levels.

A key focus is understanding the compounding effects of AI-related digital divides, where initial disparities in access or understanding lead to cascading disadvantages in education, employment, and economic opportunity. This includes examining how AI systems might amplify existing inequalities through feedback loops, where those with greater access to AI tools gain compounding advantages in productivity, learning, and economic advancement. Researchers study both direct effects (e.g., differential access to AI-powered educational tools) and indirect effects (e.g., varying ability to navigate AI-mediated job markets).

Methodologically, this field combines quantitative analysis of technology adoption patterns with qualitative studies of user experiences and barriers to access. Researchers develop metrics for measuring AI literacy and access levels, model the economic impacts of AI-related digital divides, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at bridging these gaps. A central challenge is understanding how rapidly evolving AI capabilities create new forms of digital divide, requiring continuous adaptation of research frameworks and intervention strategies.
