    "published_date": "2024-12-04",
    "summary": "The article analyzes three AI governance strategies—Cooperative Development, Strategic Advantage, and Global Moratorium—evaluating their effectiveness based on the difficulty of aligning AI and the timeline for its development. The optimal strategy shifts depending on these factors, with Cooperative Development favored for longer timelines and easier alignment, Strategic Advantage for shorter timelines and moderate alignment difficulty, and Global Moratorium as a last resort for extremely short timelines or very difficult alignment problems."

    "title": "Digital inequality beyond the digital divide: conceptualizing adverse digital incorporation in the global South",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Digital systems are significantly associated with inequality in the global South. That association has traditionally been understood in terms of the digital divide or related terminologies whose core conceptualization is the exclusion of some groups from the benefits of digital systems. However, with the growing breadth and depth of digital engagement in the global South, an exclusion worldview is no longer sufficient. What is also needed is an understanding of how inequalities are created for some groups that are included in digital systems. This paper creates such an understanding, drawing from ideas in the development studies literature on chronic poverty to inductively build a model of a new concept: 'adverse digital incorporation', meaning inclusion in a digital system that enables a more-advantaged group to extract disproportionate value from the work or resources of another, less-advantaged group. This new model will enable those involved with digital development to understand why, how and for whom inequality can emerge from the growing use of digital systems in the global South. It creates a systematic framework incorporating the processes, the drivers, and the causes of adverse digital incorporation that will provide detailed new insights. The paper concludes with implications for both digital development researchers and practitioners that derive from the model and its exposure to the broader components of power that shape the inclusionary connection between digital and inequality.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces \"adverse digital incorporation,\" a concept describing how digital inclusion in the Global South can exacerbate existing inequalities by allowing more-advantaged groups to exploit the labor or resources of less-advantaged groups. The authors develop a model to understand the processes, drivers, and causes of this phenomenon, offering insights for digital development researchers and practitioners."

    "title": "AI Efficiency Index: Identifying Regulatory and Policy Constraints for Resilient National AI Ecosystems",
    "abstract": "We develop efficiency estimates for the production, implementation and diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) services. We use a variety of data measuring factors relating to AI input and output. We start by constructing a set of nine different AI efficiency measures using non-parametric technique of data envelopment analysis (DAE). We then proceed to analyse the cross-country time variation of these estimates and compare these with different policy measures and institutional indicators. In particular, we link our AI efficiency measures to general characteristics of a country's innovation system including indicators reflecting product market regulation, tax subsidies for R\\&D investment and institutional factors linked to starting a business and (intellectual) property rights. We find that policy measures differ in their impact on our AI efficiency scores: Tax subsidies are important to enhance start-up investment activity, especially in countries with high barriers to entry and weak property rights. Product market frictions such as public ownership --- especially in the telecommunications industry --- is pernicious to patenting efficiency in the field of AI. Our results highlight the importance of differentiated policy interventions at different stages (and attributes) of the AI production chain.",

    "summary": "The paper constructs nine AI efficiency measures using data envelopment analysis to assess cross-country variations, linking these to policy measures and institutional indicators. Findings reveal that tax subsidies boost AI startups, particularly in countries with high barriers to entry, while product market regulations, especially in telecommunications, negatively impact AI patenting efficiency."
