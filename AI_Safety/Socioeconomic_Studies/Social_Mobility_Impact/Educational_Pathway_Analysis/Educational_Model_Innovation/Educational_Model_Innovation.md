### Mini Description

Examination of new educational formats and delivery methods enabled by AI technologies and their effectiveness in promoting social mobility

### Description

Educational Model Innovation examines how AI technologies enable and shape novel approaches to learning and education delivery. This research area investigates emerging educational formats that move beyond traditional classroom settings and standard online learning, focusing on how AI can create more adaptive, personalized, and effective learning experiences. Key considerations include the scalability of new models, their accessibility across different populations, and their effectiveness in promoting both knowledge acquisition and practical skill development.

Researchers analyze various innovative approaches, from AI-powered microlearning platforms and adaptive learning environments to immersive educational experiences using virtual and augmented reality. The field examines how these new models can better accommodate different learning styles, pace preferences, and educational goals while maintaining or improving educational quality. Special attention is given to how these innovations might reshape the traditional relationship between students, educators, and educational institutions.

A central challenge is evaluating the long-term effectiveness and societal implications of these new educational models. This includes studying their impact on student engagement, knowledge retention, and skill transfer, as well as their potential to democratize education or create new forms of educational inequality. Researchers also investigate how these innovations might affect the role of human teachers, the nature of student assessment, and the certification of learning outcomes.
