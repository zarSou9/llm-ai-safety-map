    "title": "Predicting Long-Term Student Outcomes from Short-Term EdTech Log Data",
    "published_date": "2024-12-20",
    "abstract": "Educational stakeholders are often particularly interested in sparse, delayed student outcomes, like end-of-year statewide exams. The rare occurrence of such assessments makes it harder to identify students likely to fail such assessments, as well as making it slow for researchers and educators to be able to assess the effectiveness of particular educational tools. Prior work has primarily focused on using logs from students full usage (e.g. year-long) of an educational product to predict outcomes, or considered predictive accuracy using a few minutes to predict outcomes after a short (e.g. 1 hour) session. In contrast, we investigate machine learning predictors using students' logs during their first few hours of usage can provide useful predictive insight into those students' end-of-school year external assessment. We do this on three diverse datasets: from students in Uganda using a literacy game product, and from students in the US using two mathematics intelligent tutoring systems. We consider various measures of the accuracy of the resulting predictors, including its ability to identify students at different parts along the assessment performance distribution. Our findings suggest that short-term log usage data, from 2-5 hours, can be used to provide valuable signal about students' long-term external performance.",
    "summary": "This study demonstrates that machine learning models can accurately predict students' end-of-year academic performance using only their first few hours of engagement with educational technology, across diverse datasets and learning contexts. This allows for earlier identification of at-risk students and faster evaluation of educational tools."

    "title": "Whose ChatGPT? Unveiling Real-World Educational Inequalities Introduced by Large Language Models",
    "published_date": "2024-10-29",
    "abstract": "The universal availability of ChatGPT and other similar tools since late 2022 has prompted tremendous public excitement and experimental effort about the potential of large language models (LLMs) to improve learning experience and outcomes, especially for learners from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, little research has systematically examined the real-world impacts of LLM availability on educational equity beyond theoretical projections and controlled studies of innovative LLM applications. To depict trends of post-LLM inequalities, we analyze 1,140,328 academic writing submissions from 16,791 college students across 2,391 courses between 2021 and 2024 at a public, minority-serving institution in the US. We find that students' overall writing quality gradually increased following the availability of LLMs and that the writing quality gaps between linguistically advantaged and disadvantaged students became increasingly narrower. However, this equitizing effect was more concentrated on students with higher socioeconomic status. These findings shed light on the digital divides in the era of LLMs and raise questions about the equity benefits of LLMs in early stages and highlight the need for researchers and practitioners on developing responsible practices to improve educational equity through LLMs.",
    "summary": "A study of student writing assignments before and after ChatGPT's release found that while overall writing quality improved, the benefits were disproportionately enjoyed by higher socioeconomic status students, highlighting the potential for LLMs to exacerbate existing educational inequalities. This suggests that while LLMs may improve overall outcomes, careful consideration of equitable access and responsible implementation is crucial."

    "title": "Improving Student Learning with Hybrid Human-AI Tutoring: A Three-Study Quasi-Experimental Investigation",
    "published_date": "2023-12-18",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications to support human tutoring have potential to significantly improve learning outcomes, but engagement issues persist, especially among students from low-income backgrounds. We introduce an AI-assisted tutoring model that combines human and AI tutoring and hypothesize this synergy will have positive impacts on learning processes. To investigate this hypothesis, we conduct a three-study quasi-experiment across three urban and low-income middle schools: 1) 125 students in a Pennsylvania school; 2) 385 students (50% Latinx) in a California school, and 3) 75 students (100% Black) in a Pennsylvania charter school, all implementing analogous tutoring models. We compare learning analytics of students engaged in human-AI tutoring compared to students using math software only. We find human-AI tutoring has positive effects, particularly in student's proficiency and usage, with evidence suggesting lower achieving students may benefit more compared to higher achieving students. We illustrate the use of quasi-experimental methods adapted to the particulars of different schools and data-availability contexts so as to achieve the rapid data-driven iteration needed to guide an inspired creation into effective innovation. Future work focuses on improving the tutor dashboard and optimizing tutor-student ratios, while maintaining annual costs per student of approximately $700 annually.",

    "summary": "A three-study quasi-experiment found that a hybrid human-AI tutoring model improved math learning outcomes, particularly for lower-achieving students in urban, low-income middle schools, compared to using math software alone. The study highlights the effectiveness of this approach and the adaptability of quasi-experimental methods for rapid iteration in educational technology development."

    "title": "Have Learning Analytics Dashboards Lived Up to the Hype? A Systematic Review of Impact on Students' Achievement, Motivation, Participation and Attitude",
    "published_date": "2023-12-22",
    "abstract": "While learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are the most common form of LA intervention, there is limited evidence regarding their impact on students' learning outcomes. This systematic review synthesizes the findings of 38 research studies to investigate the impact of LADs on students' learning outcomes, encompassing achievement, participation, motivation, and attitudes. As we currently stand, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that LADs have lived up to the promise of improving academic achievement. Most studies reported negligible or small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered controlled experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of LADs, confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels. Similarly, the impact of LADs on motivation and attitudes appeared modest, with only a few exceptions demonstrating significant effects. Small sample sizes in these studies highlight the need for larger-scale investigations to validate these findings. Notably, LADs showed a relatively substantial impact on student participation. Several studies reported medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that LADs can promote engagement and interaction in online learning environments. However, methodological shortcomings, such as reliance on traditional evaluation methods, self-selection bias, the assumption that access equates to usage, and a lack of standardized assessment tools, emerged as recurring issues. To advance the research line for LADs, researchers should use rigorous assessment methods and establish clear standards for evaluating learning constructs. Such efforts will advance our understanding of the potential of LADs to enhance learning outcomes and provide valuable insights for educators and researchers alike.",

    "summary": "A systematic review of 38 studies found limited evidence that learning analytics dashboards improve student achievement, motivation, or attitudes, despite showing a potentially substantial positive impact on student participation; methodological weaknesses in existing research necessitate more rigorous studies to determine the true effectiveness of these dashboards."

    "abstract": "This research study explores the conceptualization, development, and deployment of an innovative learning analytics tool, leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 model to quantify student engagement, map learning progression, and evaluate diverse instructional strategies within an educational context. By analyzing critical data points such as students' stress levels, curiosity, confusion, agitation, topic preferences, and study methods, the tool provides a comprehensive view of the learning environment. It also employs Bloom's taxonomy to assess cognitive development based on student inquiries. In addition to technical evaluation through synthetic data, feedback from a survey of teaching faculty at the University of Iowa was collected to gauge perceived benefits and challenges. Faculty recognized the tool's potential to enhance instructional decision-making through real-time insights but expressed concerns about data security and the accuracy of AI-generated insights. The study outlines the design, implementation, and evaluation of the tool, highlighting its contributions to educational outcomes, practical integration within learning management systems, and future refinements needed to address privacy and accuracy concerns. This research underscores AI's role in shaping personalized, data-driven education.",
