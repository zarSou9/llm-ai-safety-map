### Mini Description

Research on how educational institutions transform their structures and practices in response to AI integration

### Description

Institutional Adaptation research examines how educational institutions transform their organizational structures, pedagogical approaches, and operational processes in response to AI integration. This includes studying how schools, universities, and other educational organizations modify their governance models, staff roles, infrastructure, and teaching methodologies to effectively incorporate AI technologies while maintaining their educational mission and institutional integrity.

A central focus is understanding the barriers and enablers of successful institutional transformation, including factors like organizational culture, resource constraints, stakeholder resistance, and regulatory requirements. Researchers analyze how different types of institutions navigate these challenges, examining variations in adaptation strategies between public and private institutions, across different educational levels, and among institutions serving diverse student populations. This includes investigating how institutions balance the pressure to innovate with the need to maintain educational quality and ensure equitable access.

The field also explores how institutional adaptation to AI affects relationships between different educational stakeholders - administrators, faculty, students, and support staff. This includes studying changes in decision-making processes, professional development requirements, and institutional policies regarding AI use. Researchers examine how these adaptations influence institutional effectiveness, student outcomes, and the overall sustainability of educational organizations in an AI-transformed landscape.
