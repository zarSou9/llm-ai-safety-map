    "published_date": "2024-02-13",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) advances and the rapid adoption of generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, present new opportunities and challenges for higher education. While substantial literature discusses AI in higher education, there is a lack of a systems approach that captures a holistic view of the structure and dynamics of the AI transformation of higher education institutions (HEIs). To fill this gap, this article develops a causal loop diagram (CLD) to map the causal feedback mechanisms of AI transformation in a typical HEI. We identify important variables and their relationships and map multiple reinforcing and balancing feedback loops accounting for the forces that drive the AI transformation and its impact on value creation in a typical HEI. The model shows how, motivated by AI technology advances, the HEI can invest in AI to improve student learning, research, and administration while dealing with academic integrity problems and adapting to job market changes by emphasizing AI-complementary student skills. We explore model insights, scenarios, and policy interventions and recommend that HEI leaders become systems thinkers to manage the complexity of the AI transformation and benefit from the AI feedback loops while avoiding policy traps that may lead to decline. We also discuss the notion of HEIs influencing the direction of AI and directions for future research on AI transformation and the sustainability of HEIs.",

    "published_date": "2024-05-29",
    "abstract": "The advent of Artificial Intelligence is expected to imply profound changes in the short-term. It is therefore imperative for Academia, and particularly for the Computer Science scope, to develop cross-disciplinary tools that bond AI developments to their social dimension. To this aim, we introduce the Challenge-Device-Synthesis methodology (CDS), in which a specific challenge is presented to the students of AI, who are required to develop a device as a solution for the challenge. The device becomes the object of study for the different dimensions of social transformation, and the conclusions addressed by the students during the discussion around the device are presented in a synthesis piece in the shape of a 10-page scientific paper. The latter is evaluated taking into account both the depth of analysis and the level to which it genuinely reflects the social transformations associated with the proposed AI-based device. We provide data obtained during the pilot for the implementation phase of CDS within the subject of Social Innovation, a 6-ECTS subject from the 6th semester of the Degree of Artificial Intelligence, UAB-Barcelona. We provide details on temporalisation, task distribution, methodological tools used and assessment delivery procedure, as well as qualitative analysis of the results obtained.",

    "title": "Trading off performance and human oversight in algorithmic policy: evidence from Danish college admissions",
    "published_date": "2024-11-22",
    "abstract": "Student dropout is a significant concern for educational institutions due to its social and economic impact, driving the need for risk prediction systems to identify at-risk students before enrollment. We explore the accuracy of such systems in the context of higher education by predicting degree completion before admission, with potential applications for prioritizing admissions decisions. Using a large-scale dataset from Danish higher education admissions, we demonstrate that advanced sequential AI models offer more precise and fair predictions compared to current practices that rely on either high school grade point averages or human judgment. These models not only improve accuracy but also outperform simpler models, even when the simpler models use protected sociodemographic attributes. Importantly, our predictions reveal how certain student profiles are better matched with specific programs and fields, suggesting potential efficiency and welfare gains in public policy. We estimate that even the use of simple AI models to guide admissions decisions, particularly in response to a newly implemented nationwide policy reducing admissions by 10 percent, could yield significant economic benefits. However, this improvement would come at the cost of reduced human oversight and lower transparency. Our findings underscore both the potential and challenges of incorporating advanced AI into educational policymaking.",
    "summary": "A study using Danish college admissions data shows that AI models outperform traditional methods in predicting student degree completion, offering potential economic benefits by improving admissions decisions, but at the cost of reduced human oversight and transparency. This improved accuracy is achieved even without using protected sociodemographic attributes."

    "title": "Towards Responsible Development of Generative AI for Education: An Evaluation-Driven Approach",
    "published_date": "2024-05-21",
    "abstract": "A major challenge facing the world is the provision of equitable and universal access to quality education. Recent advances in generative AI (gen AI) have created excitement about the potential of new technologies to offer a personal tutor for every learner and a teaching assistant for every teacher. The full extent of this dream, however, has not yet materialised. We argue that this is primarily due to the difficulties with verbalising pedagogical intuitions into gen AI prompts and the lack of good evaluation practices, reinforced by the challenges in defining excellent pedagogy. Here we present our work collaborating with learners and educators to translate high level principles from learning science into a pragmatic set of seven diverse educational benchmarks, spanning quantitative, qualitative, automatic and human evaluations; and to develop a new set of fine-tuning datasets to improve the pedagogical capabilities of Gemini, introducing LearnLM-Tutor. Our evaluations show that LearnLM-Tutor is consistently preferred over a prompt tuned Gemini by educators and learners on a number of pedagogical dimensions. We hope that this work can serve as a first step towards developing a comprehensive educational evaluation framework, and that this can enable rapid progress within the AI and EdTech communities towards maximising the positive impact of gen AI in education.",

    "published_date": "2023-01-13",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, an explosion in the availability of education-related datasets has enabled new computational research in education. Much of this work has investigated digital traces of online learners in order to better understand and optimize their cognitive learning processes. Yet cognitive learning on digital platforms does not equal education. Instead, education is an inherently social, cultural, economic, and political process manifesting in physical spaces, and educational outcomes are influenced by many factors that precede and shape the cognitive learning process. Many of these are social factors like children's connections to schools (including teachers, counselors, and role models), parents and families, and the broader neighborhoods in which they live. In this article, we briefly discuss recent studies of learning through large-scale digital platforms, but largely focus on those exploring sociological aspects of education. We believe computational social scientists can creatively advance this emerging research frontier—and in doing so, help facilitate more equitable educational and life outcomes.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Extant research has observed that educational expectations are malleable and adjust in response to educational inputs such as the position in a stratified level of education. Examining two distinct forms of curricular differentiation introduced in the comprehensive Spanish educational system (low-ability grouping programmes), I study whether two identical 15-year-old students with the same academic performance would differ in their educational expectations if one of them was diverted into these programmes. I use the 2018 PISA database and Entropy Balancing to balance the distribution of variables that confound the relationship between low-ability grouping and expectations. Results indicate that being diverted into a low-ability group exerts a substantial effect on the vertical and horizontal expectations about Upper Secondary and Tertiary Education. Programmes based on a simplification of the general curriculum mainly condition horizontal expectations (academic vs vocational education), while pre-vocational programmes also shorten the educational plans of participants. Therefore, the effects associated with the educational position of the student are not exclusive of highly stratified systems and other forms of curricular differentiation in otherwise highly comprehensive systems can be influential in the reconfiguration of educational expectations.",

    "summary": "This study uses Spanish PISA data to show that low-ability grouping significantly lowers students' educational expectations, both in terms of the level of education pursued and the type of track chosen (academic vs. vocational). These effects demonstrate that even in ostensibly comprehensive systems, curricular differentiation can significantly shape students' aspirations."

    "published_date": "2022-12-31",
    "abstract": ": Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have sparked renewed interest in its potential to improve education. However, AI is a loose umbrella term that refers to a collection of methods, capabilities, and limitations—many of which are often not explicitly articulated by researchers, education technology companies, or other AI developers. In this paper, we seek to clarify what “AI” is and the potential it holds to both advance and hamper educational opportunities that may improve the human condition. We offer a basic introduction to different methods and philosophies underpinning AI, discuss recent advances, explore applications to education, and highlight key limitations and risks. We conclude with a set of questions that educationalists may ask as they encounter AI in their research and practice. Our hope is to make often jargon-laden terms and concepts accessible, so that all are equipped to understand, interrogate, and ultimately shape the development of human-centered AI in education.",
