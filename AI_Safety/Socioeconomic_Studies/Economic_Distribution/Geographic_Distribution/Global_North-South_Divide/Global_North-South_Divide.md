### Mini Description

Investigation of how AI development and deployment patterns affect economic relationships and power dynamics between developed and developing nations

### Description

The Global North-South Divide in AI safety research examines how artificial intelligence technologies affect and potentially exacerbate existing economic disparities between developed and developing nations. This includes analyzing asymmetries in AI development capabilities, data ownership, technological infrastructure, and human capital that create barriers for Global South participation in the AI economy. The research explores how current AI deployment patterns often reflect and reinforce historical power dynamics, with most advanced AI development concentrated in wealthy nations while developing countries risk becoming primarily consumers or data sources.

A central focus is understanding how different aspects of AI development create competitive advantages for Global North nations. This includes examining how existing technological infrastructure, educational systems, and financial resources enable faster AI adoption and development, while limitations in these areas create barriers for Global South nations. Researchers study how data collection practices, AI training methodologies, and deployment strategies often reflect Global North perspectives and needs, potentially creating AI systems less suited for Global South contexts.

The field emphasizes identifying intervention points and strategies for more equitable global AI development. This includes studying how technology transfer mechanisms, international cooperation frameworks, and capacity-building initiatives might help bridge the divide. Researchers examine alternative AI development approaches that better incorporate Global South perspectives and needs, including investigating how local AI development ecosystems might be fostered without simply replicating Global North models. A key consideration is how international governance frameworks and economic policies might be structured to promote more balanced global AI development while addressing concerns about technological sovereignty and economic independence.
