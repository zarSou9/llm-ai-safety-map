    "title": "The Turing Valley: How AI Capabilities Shape Labor Income",
    "published_date": "2024-08-29",
    "abstract": "Do improvements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) benefit workers? We study how AI capabilities influence labor income in a competitive economy where production requires multidimensional knowledge, and firms organize production by matching humans and AI-powered machines in hierarchies designed to use knowledge efficiently. We show that advancements in AI in dimensions where machines underperform humans decrease total labor income, while advancements in dimensions where machines outperform humans increase it. Hence, if AI initially underperforms humans in all dimensions and improves gradually, total labor income initially declines before rising. We also characterize the AI that maximizes labor income. When humans are sufficiently weak in all knowledge dimensions, labor income is maximized when AI is as good as possible in all dimensions. Otherwise, labor income is maximized when AI simultaneously performs as poorly as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively strong and as well as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively weak. Our results suggest that choosing the direction of AI development can create significant divisions between the interests of labor and capital.",
    "summary": "The authors' model shows that AI advancements increase total labor income only when machines surpass human capabilities in specific areas; initially, if AI is weaker than humans across the board, improvements decrease labor income before eventually increasing it."

    "title": "Multidimensional Skills as a Measure of Human Capital: Evidence from LinkedIn Profiles",
    "published_date": "2024-09-27",
    "abstract": "We measure human capital using the self-reported skill sets of 8.75 million U.S. college graduates from professional profiles on the online platform LinkedIn. We establish that these skills are systematically related to human capital investments such as different types of schooling and work experience. The average profile of the number of reported skills by age looks remarkably similar to the well-established concave age-earnings profiles. More experienced workers and those with higher educational degrees have larger shares of occupation-specific skills, consistent with their acquisition through professional-degree programs and on-the-job experience. Workers who report more, and particularly more specific and managerial, skills are more likely to hold highly paid jobs. Skill differences across workers can account for more earnings variation than detailed vectors of education and experience. We also document a substantial gender gap in reported skills, which starts to manifest when young women reach typical ages of first motherhood. Gender differences in skill profiles can rationalize a substantial proportion of the gender gap in the propensity to work in highly paid jobs. Overall, the results are consistent with an important role of multidimensional skills in accounting for several well-known basic labor-market patterns.",
    "summary": "Using LinkedIn data from 8.75 million U.S. college graduates, this study demonstrates that self-reported skills are a strong predictor of earnings, exceeding the predictive power of traditional measures like education and experience, and highlights a significant gender gap in skill acquisition."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence, Income Distribution and Economic Growth",
    "abstract": "The economic impact of Articial Intelligence (AI) is studied using a (semi) endogenous growth model with two novel features. First, the task approach from labor economics is reformulated and integrated into a growth model. Second, the standard representative household assumption is rejected, so that aggregate demand restrictions can be introduced. With these novel features it is shown that (i) AI automation can decrease the share of labor income no matter the size of the elasticity of substitution between AI and labor, and (ii) when this elasticity is high, AI will unambiguously reduce aggregate demand and slow down GDP growth, even in the face of the positive technology shock that AI entails. If the elasticity of substitution is low, then GDP, productivity and wage growth may however still slow down, because the economy will then fail to benefit from the supply-side driven capacity expansion potential that AI can deliver. The model can thus explain why advanced countries tend to experience, despite much AI hype, the simultaneous existence of rather high employment with stagnating wages, productivity, and GDP.",

    "summary": "A new growth model incorporating AI automation and heterogeneous households demonstrates that AI can decrease labor income share regardless of substitutability with labor, and may reduce aggregate demand and slow GDP growth, especially when AI and labor are highly substitutable. Even with low substitutability, AI's potential for supply-side growth may be unrealized, leading to slower wage, productivity, and GDP growth."

    "published_date": "2023-11-14",
    "abstract": "What will likely be the effect of the emergence of ChatGPT and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI) on the skill premium? To address this question, we develop a nested constant elasticity of substitution production function that distinguishes between industrial robots and AI. Industrial robots predominantly substitute for low-skill workers, whereas AI mainly helps to perform the tasks of high-skill workers. We show that AI reduces the skill premium as long as it is more substitutable for high-skill workers than low-skill workers are for high-skill workers.",

    "summary": "This paper models the impact of AI on the skill premium using a nested CES production function, finding that AI reduces the skill premium if it's more substitutable for high-skill workers than low-skill workers are for high-skill workers."

    "title": "Skills or Degree? The Rise of Skill-Based Hiring for AI and Green Jobs",
    "published_date": "2023-12-19",
    "abstract": "Emerging professions in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sustainability (green jobs) are experiencing labour shortages as industry demand outpaces labour supply. In this context, our study aims to understand whether employers have begun focusing more on individual skills rather than formal qualifications in their recruitment processes. We analysed a large time-series dataset of approximately eleven million online job vacancies in the UK from 2018 to mid-2024, drawing on diverse literature on technological change and labour market signalling. Our findings provide evidence that employers have initiated\"skill-based hiring\"for AI roles, adopting more flexible hiring practices to expand the available talent pool. From 2018-2023, demand for AI roles grew by 21% as a proportion of all postings (and accelerated into 2024). Simultaneously, mentions of university education requirements for AI roles declined by 15%. Our regression analysis shows that university degrees have a significantly lower wage premium for both AI and green roles. In contrast, AI skills command a wage premium of 23%, exceeding the value of degrees up until the PhD-level (33%). In occupations with high demand for AI skills, the premium for skills is high, and the reward for degrees is relatively low. We recommend leveraging alternative skill-building formats such as apprenticeships, on-the-job training, MOOCs, vocational education and training, micro-certificates, and online bootcamps to fully utilise human capital and address talent shortages.",
    "citation_count": 3,
    "summary": "A study of UK job postings from 2018-2024 reveals a shift towards skills-based hiring in AI and green jobs, with decreasing emphasis on formal degrees and a significant wage premium for AI skills exceeding that of university education. This suggests that alternative skill development pathways are crucial to addressing labor shortages in these high-demand sectors."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence in the Knowledge Economy",
    "published_date": "2023-12-09",
    "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape the knowledge economy by enabling problem solving at scale. This paper introduces a framework to analyze this transformation, incorporating AI into an economy where humans form hierarchical firms to use their time efficiently: Less knowledgeable individuals become\"workers\"solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable individuals become\"solvers\"assisting workers with exceptional problems. We model AI as a technology that transforms computing power into\"AI agents,\"which can either operate autonomously (as co-workers or solvers/co-pilots) or non-autonomously (only as co-pilots). We show that basic autonomous AI displaces humans towards specialized problem solving, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced autonomous AI reallocates humans to routine work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. While autonomous AI primarily benefits the most knowledgeable individuals, non-autonomous AI disproportionately benefits the least knowledgeable. However, autonomous AI achieves higher overall output. These findings reconcile seemingly contradictory empirical evidence and reveal key tradeoffs involved in regulating AI autonomy.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the knowledge economy, finding that basic autonomous AI leads to smaller, less productive firms, while advanced autonomous AI creates larger, more productive, and decentralized ones, with differing distributional effects depending on AI autonomy levels. The model reveals trade-offs in regulating AI autonomy and explains seemingly contradictory empirical observations."

    "title": "The Economic Effect of Gaining a New Qualification Later in Life",
    "published_date": "2023-04-04",
    "abstract": "Pursuing educational qualifications later in life is an increasingly common phenomenon within OECD countries since technological change and automation continues to drive the evolution of skills needed in many professions. We focus on the causal impacts to economic returns of degrees completed later in life, where motivations and capabilities to acquire additional education may be distinct from education in early years. We find that completing an additional degree leads to more than \\$3000 (AUD, 2019) extra income per year compared to those who do not complete additional study. For outcomes, treatment and controls we use the extremely rich and nationally representative longitudinal data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia survey (HILDA). To take full advantage of the complexity and richness of this data we use a Machine Learning (ML) based methodology for causal effect estimation. We are also able to use ML to discover sources of heterogeneity in the effects of gaining additional qualifications. For example, those younger than 45 years of age when obtaining additional qualifications tend to reap more benefits (as much as \\$50 per week more) than others.",
    "summary": "Using Australian longitudinal data and machine learning, this study finds that obtaining an additional degree later in life increases annual income by over $3000 AUD (2019), with those under 45 experiencing even greater benefits."
