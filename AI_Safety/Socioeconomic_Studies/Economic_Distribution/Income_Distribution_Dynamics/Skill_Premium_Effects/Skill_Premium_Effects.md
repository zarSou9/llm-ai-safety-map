### Mini Description

Study of how AI affects returns to different types of skills and education, including both technical and non-technical capabilities

### Description

Skill Premium Effects research examines how AI technologies influence the economic returns to different types of skills, expertise, and educational attainment in the labor market. This includes analyzing how AI adoption creates, amplifies, or diminishes wage premiums for various skill sets, from technical capabilities directly related to AI development to complementary skills like creative problem-solving and interpersonal communication. The research considers both immediate effects as AI technologies are deployed and longer-term structural changes in skill valuation as labor markets adapt.

A central focus is understanding the dynamic relationship between AI capabilities and human skills. As AI systems become more advanced, certain human skills may become less valuable due to automation, while others may see increased demand due to complementarity with AI systems. Researchers examine how these shifts affect wage differentials between different skill groups, considering factors such as skill transferability, adaptation costs, and the speed of workforce upskilling.

The field also investigates how educational and training systems respond to AI-driven changes in skill premiums, and how these responses in turn affect labor market outcomes. This includes studying the effectiveness of different educational approaches in developing AI-complementary skills, the role of continuous learning and skill updating, and how varying access to skill development opportunities might exacerbate or mitigate existing inequalities. Particular attention is paid to identifying skills likely to maintain or increase their premium as AI capabilities expand.
