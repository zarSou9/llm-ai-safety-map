    "title": "The Turing Valley: How AI Capabilities Shape Labor Income",
    "published_date": "2024-08-29",
    "abstract": "Do improvements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) benefit workers? We study how AI capabilities influence labor income in a competitive economy where production requires multidimensional knowledge, and firms organize production by matching humans and AI-powered machines in hierarchies designed to use knowledge efficiently. We show that advancements in AI in dimensions where machines underperform humans decrease total labor income, while advancements in dimensions where machines outperform humans increase it. Hence, if AI initially underperforms humans in all dimensions and improves gradually, total labor income initially declines before rising. We also characterize the AI that maximizes labor income. When humans are sufficiently weak in all knowledge dimensions, labor income is maximized when AI is as good as possible in all dimensions. Otherwise, labor income is maximized when AI simultaneously performs as poorly as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively strong and as well as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively weak. Our results suggest that choosing the direction of AI development can create significant divisions between the interests of labor and capital.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of AI advancements on labor income, finding that improvements in areas where AI initially outperforms humans increase total labor income, while improvements in areas where humans excel initially decrease it, leading to a potential \"Turing Valley\" of initially declining income before eventual growth. The optimal AI for maximizing labor income depends on the relative strengths and weaknesses of human workers compared to AI."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence, Income Distribution and Economic Growth",
    "abstract": "The economic impact of Articial Intelligence (AI) is studied using a (semi) endogenous growth model with two novel features. First, the task approach from labor economics is reformulated and integrated into a growth model. Second, the standard representative household assumption is rejected, so that aggregate demand restrictions can be introduced. With these novel features it is shown that (i) AI automation can decrease the share of labor income no matter the size of the elasticity of substitution between AI and labor, and (ii) when this elasticity is high, AI will unambiguously reduce aggregate demand and slow down GDP growth, even in the face of the positive technology shock that AI entails. If the elasticity of substitution is low, then GDP, productivity and wage growth may however still slow down, because the economy will then fail to benefit from the supply-side driven capacity expansion potential that AI can deliver. The model can thus explain why advanced countries tend to experience, despite much AI hype, the simultaneous existence of rather high employment with stagnating wages, productivity, and GDP.",

    "summary": "An endogenous growth model incorporating a task-based labor approach and heterogeneous households reveals that AI automation can reduce labor income share regardless of the AI-labor substitutability, and may slow GDP growth, especially when substitutability is high, due to depressed aggregate demand. Even with low substitutability, AI's potential supply-side benefits may not be fully realized, leading to slower growth in GDP, productivity, and wages."

    "title": "Household Resource Allocation Dynamics and Policies: Integrating Future Earnings of Children, Fertility, Pension, Health, and Education",
    "published_date": "2024-11-27",
    "abstract": "This study presents a model that examines how families make decisions about having children, managing resources, and planning for their financial security in light of social and economic factors. It explores the balance between the number of children and the quality of life parents wish to provide, including education and future income prospects. By considering parents' expectations about their children's future earnings, the model gives new insights into how families allocate their resources. It also looks at how decisions about savings and pensions are connected to daily spending and family planning, showing the complex links between these factors. The findings offer valuable guidance for policies that address these interrelated challenges and better support families in managing their resources.",
    "summary": "The study models household resource allocation decisions, considering the interplay of fertility choices, children's future earnings, pension planning, health, education, and spending, offering insights into family resource management and informing relevant policy design. It highlights the interconnectedness of these factors in shaping family choices and financial security."

    "title": "Machine Learning Analysis of the Impact of Increasing the Minimum Wage on Income Inequality in Spain from 2001 to 2021",
    "published_date": "2024-02-04",
    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the impact of the National Minimum Wage from 2001 to 2021. The MNW increased from 505.7/month (2001) to 1,108.3/month (2021). Using the data provided by the Spanish Tax Administration Agency, databases that represent the entire population studied can be analyzed. More accurate results and more efficient predictive models are provided by these counts. This work is characterized by the database used, which is a national census and not a sample or projection. Therefore, the study reflects results and analyses based on historical data from the Spanish Salary Census 2001-2021. Various machine-learning models show that income inequality has been reduced by raising the minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage has not led to inflation or increased unemployment. On the contrary, it has been consistent with increased net employment, contained prices, and increased corporate profit margins. The most important conclusion is that an increase in the minimum wage in the period analyzed has led to an increase in the wealth of the country, increasing employment and company profits, and is postulated, under the conditions analyzed, as an effective method for the redistribution of wealth.",
    "summary": "Utilizing Spanish national census data from 2001-2021, this study employs machine learning models to demonstrate that raising the minimum wage reduced income inequality in Spain without causing inflation or unemployment, instead correlating with increased employment and corporate profits."

    "title": "Equal Merit Does Not Imply Equality: Discrimination at Equilibrium in a Hiring Market with Symmetric Agents",
    "published_date": "2024-12-19",
    "abstract": "Machine learning has grown in popularity to help assign resources and make decisions about users, which can result in discrimination. This includes hiring markets, where employers have increasingly been interested in using automated tools to help hire candidates. In response, there has been significant effort to understand and mitigate the sources of discrimination in these tools. However, previous work has largely assumed that discrimination, in any area of ML, is the result of some initial \\textit{unequal distribution of resources} across groups: One group is on average less qualified, there is less training data for one group, or the classifier is less accurate on one group, etc. However, recent work have suggested that there are other sources of discrimination, such as relational inequality, that are notably non-distributional. First, we show consensus in strategy choice is a non-distributional source of inequality at equilibrium in games: We provide subgame perfect equilibria in a simple sequential model of a hiring market with Rubinstein-style bargaining between firms and candidates that exhibits asymmetric wages resulting from differences in agents' threat strategies during bargaining. Second, we give an initial analysis of how agents could learn such strategies via convergence of an online learning algorithm to asymmetric equilibria. Ultimately, this work motivates the further study of endogenous, possibly non-distributional, mechanisms of inequality in ML.",
    "summary": "This paper demonstrates that discriminatory outcomes in hiring, even with equally qualified candidates, can arise from strategic bargaining dynamics between firms and applicants, leading to unequal wages at equilibrium. The authors model this using a subgame perfect equilibrium analysis and explore how such unequal equilibria could emerge from an online learning algorithm."

    "published_date": "2024-01-27",
    "abstract": "This study finds exact closed-form solutions for compensating variation (CV) and equivalent variation (EV) for both marginal and non-marginal changes in public goods given homothetic utility. The parameters for these solutions are recoverable from observable data in empirical applications as a single sufficient statistic summarizes consumer preferences. The closed-form CV and EV expressions identify three economic mechanisms that determine the magnitudes of CV and EV. One of these mechanisms, the relative preference effect, helps explain the disparity between willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) for public goods.",
    "summary": "This paper derives closed-form solutions for compensating and equivalent variation for public goods under homothetic utility, using a single sufficient statistic from observable data. These solutions illuminate three economic mechanisms, including a \"relative preference effect\" explaining the WTP-WTA gap."

    "title": "The macroeconomic consequences of artificial intelligence: A theoretical framework",
    "abstract": "The authors explore the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy by improving the neoclassical production function and the task-based model. Based on the capital accumulation of artificial intelligence and technological progress, they present a theoretical model that explores the effect of alternative and complementary artificial intelligence on wages, capital prices, labor share, capital share and economic growth. The model shows that artificial intelligence capital lowers the capital prices and increases wages. In addition, if artificial intelligence and labor force are complementary, artificial intelligence capital has a positive impact on labor share, but if artificial intelligence and labor force can substitute each other, labor share is negatively influenced by artificial intelligence capital. The authors extend the task-based model and find that technological progress increases both wages and labor share by generating new tasks. In the long run, without consideration of exogenous technology, as the artificial intelligence capital accumulates, per capita output, per capita traditional capital and per capita artificial intelligence capital grow at the same rate, and economic growth finally reaches steady state equili- brium. With exogenous technology considered, artificial intelligence technology improves, and sustained economic growth is achieved.",
