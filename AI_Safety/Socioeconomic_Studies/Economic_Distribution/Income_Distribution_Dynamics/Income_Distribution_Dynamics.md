### Mini Description

Study of how AI affects wage distributions, returns to different types of labor, and the division between labor and capital income

### Description

Income Distribution Dynamics examines how AI technologies influence the patterns and mechanisms of income allocation across different segments of society. This includes analyzing changes in wage structures, skill premiums, and income volatility as AI systems are integrated into various economic sectors. The research focuses on understanding both direct effects, such as automation-driven wage changes, and indirect effects, such as shifts in bargaining power and labor market competition.

A key aspect of this research involves modeling how AI deployment affects different types of work and workers. This includes examining how AI complements or substitutes for different skills and tasks, how it influences the returns to education and experience, and how it affects income mobility within and across occupations. Researchers study both short-term disruptions, such as displacement effects, and long-term structural changes in how work is valued and compensated.

The field also investigates how AI-driven changes in organizational structures and business models affect income distribution. This includes analyzing changes in employment relationships (such as the growth of gig economy platforms), shifts in compensation models (including the role of equity and performance-based pay), and changes in the relative bargaining power of different worker groups. Particular attention is paid to identifying patterns that might exacerbate or mitigate existing income inequalities.
