Analysis of how AI deployment affects wage levels and differentials across occupations, skills, and industries

### Description

Wage Structure Evolution examines how AI technologies reshape the fundamental patterns and hierarchies of wages across the economy. This includes analyzing both direct wage effects, such as changes in base pay rates and wage growth trajectories within occupations, and structural shifts in how different types of work are valued relative to each other. The research combines empirical analysis of historical wage data with predictive modeling to understand how AI deployment patterns may alter traditional wage relationships and create new wage hierarchies.

A central focus is understanding how AI capabilities affect wage determination mechanisms across different labor market segments. This includes examining how AI-driven productivity gains translate into wage changes, how automation risk influences wage bargaining, and how the introduction of AI tools affects wage premiums for different skills and responsibilities. Researchers investigate both occupation-level effects, such as changes in wage distributions within professional categories, and broader structural changes in wage relationships between different types of work.

The field also explores how AI deployment affects wage mobility and career progression patterns. This includes studying how AI adoption influences promotion structures, skill-based pay differentials, and opportunities for wage growth through career advancement. Particular attention is paid to identifying emerging wage structure patterns that might create new forms of wage stratification or alter traditional paths to higher wages, including the potential emergence of new high-wage occupations and the transformation of existing wage hierarchies.
