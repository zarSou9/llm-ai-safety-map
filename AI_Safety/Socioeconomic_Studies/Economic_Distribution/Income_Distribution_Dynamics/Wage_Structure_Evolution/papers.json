    "published_date": "2025-01-03",
    "summary": "The author argues that the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will create an \"intelligence curse,\" mirroring the \"resource curse\" of rentier states. Because AGI will replace human labor, powerful actors will lose the incentive to invest in human capital, leading to societal instability and a decline in human well-being."

    "summary": "Research automation necessitates a shift from individual \"AI scientists\" to coordinated \"AI research fleets,\" mirroring historical transitions like the industrial revolution and algorithmic trading. This requires institutional restructuring beyond technological advancements, emphasizing specialized roles and workflows optimized for AI's capabilities and limitations."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence, Income Distribution and Economic Growth",
    "abstract": "The economic impact of Articial Intelligence (AI) is studied using a (semi) endogenous growth model with two novel features. First, the task approach from labor economics is reformulated and integrated into a growth model. Second, the standard representative household assumption is rejected, so that aggregate demand restrictions can be introduced. With these novel features it is shown that (i) AI automation can decrease the share of labor income no matter the size of the elasticity of substitution between AI and labor, and (ii) when this elasticity is high, AI will unambiguously reduce aggregate demand and slow down GDP growth, even in the face of the positive technology shock that AI entails. If the elasticity of substitution is low, then GDP, productivity and wage growth may however still slow down, because the economy will then fail to benefit from the supply-side driven capacity expansion potential that AI can deliver. The model can thus explain why advanced countries tend to experience, despite much AI hype, the simultaneous existence of rather high employment with stagnating wages, productivity, and GDP.",

    "summary": "A new growth model incorporating AI automation and heterogeneous households demonstrates that AI can decrease labor income share regardless of the AI-labor substitution elasticity, and may reduce aggregate demand and GDP growth, particularly when substitution elasticity is high, explaining simultaneous high employment and stagnant economic indicators in advanced economies."

    "title": "Labour and technology at the time of Covid-19. Can artificial intelligence mitigate the need for proximity?",
    "abstract": "Social distancing has become worldwide the key public policy to be implemented during the COVID-19 epidemic and reducing the degree of proximity among workers turned out to be an important dimension. An emerging literature looks at the role of automation in supporting the work of humans but the potential of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to inﬂuence the need for physical proximity on the workplace has been left largely unexplored. By using a unique and innovative dataset that combines data on advancements of AI at the occupational level with information on the required proximity in the job-place and administrative employer-employee data on job ﬂows, our results show that AI and proximity stand in an inverse U-shape relationship at the sectoral level, with high advancements in AI that are negatively associated with proximity. We detect this pattern among sectors that were closed due to the lockdown measures as well as among sectors that remained open. We argue that, apart from the expected gains in productivity and competitiveness, preserving jobs and economic activities in a situation of high contagion may be the additional beneﬁts of a policy favouring digitization.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the relationship between AI adoption and workplace proximity, finding an inverse U-shaped correlation where high AI advancement is negatively associated with the need for physical proximity, suggesting AI can mitigate the need for close contact, particularly beneficial during pandemics. This effect is observed in both lockdown-affected and unaffected sectors."

This metric, alongside \"Top-human-Expert-Dominating AI (TEDAI)\" and \"very generally superhuman AIs,\" offers a clearer framework for discussing AI risk than relying on more ambiguous measures of overall progress."

These dimensions are independent and crucial for accurately forecasting AI's trajectory and informing policy."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence in the Knowledge Economy",
    "published_date": "2023-12-09",
    "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape the knowledge economy by enabling problem solving at scale. This paper introduces a framework to analyze this transformation, incorporating AI into an economy where humans form hierarchical firms to use their time efficiently: Less knowledgeable individuals become\"workers\"solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable individuals become\"solvers\"assisting workers with exceptional problems. We model AI as a technology that transforms computing power into\"AI agents,\"which can either operate autonomously (as co-workers or solvers/co-pilots) or non-autonomously (only as co-pilots). We show that basic autonomous AI displaces humans towards specialized problem solving, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced autonomous AI reallocates humans to routine work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. While autonomous AI primarily benefits the most knowledgeable individuals, non-autonomous AI disproportionately benefits the least knowledgeable. However, autonomous AI achieves higher overall output. These findings reconcile seemingly contradictory empirical evidence and reveal key tradeoffs involved in regulating AI autonomy.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on a hierarchical knowledge economy, finding that basic autonomous AI leads to smaller, less productive firms while advanced autonomous AI creates larger, more productive ones, with differing distributional effects depending on AI autonomy levels. The model reconciles conflicting empirical evidence regarding AI's economic effects and highlights trade-offs in AI regulation."

    "title": "AI and Jobs: Has the Inflection Point Arrived? Evidence from an Online Labor Platform",
    "published_date": "2023-12-07",
    "abstract": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has renewed the debate on the important issue of\"technology displacement\". While prior research has investigated the effect of information technology in general on human labor from a macro perspective, this paper complements the literature by examining the impact of LLMs on freelancers from a micro perspective. Specifically, we leverage the release of ChatGPT to investigate how AI influences freelancers across different online labor markets (OLMs). Employing the Difference-in-Differences method, we discovered two distinct scenarios following ChatGPT's release: 1) the displacement effect of LLMs, featuring reduced work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the translation&localization OLM; 2) the productivity effect of LLMs, featuring increased work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the web development OLM. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we developed a Cournot-type competition model to highlight the existence of an inflection point for each occupation which separates the timeline of AI progress into a honeymoon phase and a substitution phase. Before AI performance crosses the inflection point, human labor benefits each time AI improves, resulting in the honeymoon phase. However, after AI performance crosses the inflection point, additional AI enhancement hurts human labor. Further analyzing the progression from ChatGPT 3.5 to 4.0, we found three effect scenarios (i.e., productivity to productivity, displacement to displacement, and productivity to displacement), consistent with the inflection point conjecture. Heterogeneous analyses reveal that U.S. web developers tend to benefit more from the release of ChatGPT compared to their counterparts in other regions, and somewhat surprisingly, experienced translators seem more likely to exit the market than less experienced translators after the release of ChatGPT.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "Using online labor market data, this paper finds that Large Language Models (LLMs) have a dual impact on freelancers, causing job displacement in some sectors (e.g., translation) but boosting productivity and earnings in others (e.g., web development), suggesting an inflection point in AI development where benefits transition to harms."
