### Mini Description

Investigation of how AI influences the division of national income between labor and capital, including changes in profit shares and wage shares

### Description

Labor Share Dynamics investigates how AI technologies affect the distribution of economic output between labor and capital owners. This research area examines both direct mechanisms, such as automation-driven displacement of labor income, and indirect effects like changes in market structure and bargaining power. The analysis spans multiple economic levels, from firm-level compensation practices to macroeconomic shifts in national income composition.

A central focus is understanding how AI deployment influences the relative returns to different factors of production. This includes studying how AI capital complements or substitutes for human labor across various tasks and sectors, how it affects the marginal productivity of labor versus capital, and how these changes translate into income shares. Researchers examine both theoretical models of production technology evolution and empirical evidence from early AI adoption.

The field also investigates institutional and policy factors that mediate the relationship between AI deployment and labor share outcomes. This includes analyzing how different corporate governance structures, labor market institutions, and regulatory frameworks influence the distribution of AI-generated surplus between workers and capital owners. Particular attention is paid to identifying mechanisms that could help maintain stable labor shares as AI capabilities expand.
