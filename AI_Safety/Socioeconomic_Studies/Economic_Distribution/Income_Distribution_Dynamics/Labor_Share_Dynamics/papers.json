    "title": "Artificial Intelligence, Income Distribution and Economic Growth",
    "abstract": "The economic impact of Articial Intelligence (AI) is studied using a (semi) endogenous growth model with two novel features. First, the task approach from labor economics is reformulated and integrated into a growth model. Second, the standard representative household assumption is rejected, so that aggregate demand restrictions can be introduced. With these novel features it is shown that (i) AI automation can decrease the share of labor income no matter the size of the elasticity of substitution between AI and labor, and (ii) when this elasticity is high, AI will unambiguously reduce aggregate demand and slow down GDP growth, even in the face of the positive technology shock that AI entails. If the elasticity of substitution is low, then GDP, productivity and wage growth may however still slow down, because the economy will then fail to benefit from the supply-side driven capacity expansion potential that AI can deliver. The model can thus explain why advanced countries tend to experience, despite much AI hype, the simultaneous existence of rather high employment with stagnating wages, productivity, and GDP.",

    "summary": "This paper uses a novel growth model incorporating task-based labor economics and heterogeneous households to demonstrate that AI automation can simultaneously reduce labor income share and slow GDP growth, especially when AI and labor are highly substitutable; low substitutability may still hinder the realization of AI's growth potential."

    "title": "The macroeconomic consequences of artificial intelligence: A theoretical framework",
    "abstract": "The authors explore the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy by improving the neoclassical production function and the task-based model. Based on the capital accumulation of artificial intelligence and technological progress, they present a theoretical model that explores the effect of alternative and complementary artificial intelligence on wages, capital prices, labor share, capital share and economic growth. The model shows that artificial intelligence capital lowers the capital prices and increases wages. In addition, if artificial intelligence and labor force are complementary, artificial intelligence capital has a positive impact on labor share, but if artificial intelligence and labor force can substitute each other, labor share is negatively influenced by artificial intelligence capital. The authors extend the task-based model and find that technological progress increases both wages and labor share by generating new tasks. In the long run, without consideration of exogenous technology, as the artificial intelligence capital accumulates, per capita output, per capita traditional capital and per capita artificial intelligence capital grow at the same rate, and economic growth finally reaches steady state equili- brium. With exogenous technology considered, artificial intelligence technology improves, and sustained economic growth is achieved.",

    "summary": "This paper models the macroeconomic effects of artificial intelligence, finding that AI capital lowers capital prices and raises wages, impacting labor share positively if complementary to labor, negatively if substitutive. Long-run growth reaches a steady state without exogenous technological progress, but sustained growth is achieved with AI technological improvement."

    "title": "The Turing Valley: How AI Capabilities Shape Labor Income",
    "published_date": "2024-08-29",
    "abstract": "Do improvements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) benefit workers? We study how AI capabilities influence labor income in a competitive economy where production requires multidimensional knowledge, and firms organize production by matching humans and AI-powered machines in hierarchies designed to use knowledge efficiently. We show that advancements in AI in dimensions where machines underperform humans decrease total labor income, while advancements in dimensions where machines outperform humans increase it. Hence, if AI initially underperforms humans in all dimensions and improves gradually, total labor income initially declines before rising. We also characterize the AI that maximizes labor income. When humans are sufficiently weak in all knowledge dimensions, labor income is maximized when AI is as good as possible in all dimensions. Otherwise, labor income is maximized when AI simultaneously performs as poorly as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively strong and as well as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively weak. Our results suggest that choosing the direction of AI development can create significant divisions between the interests of labor and capital.",
    "summary": "The paper models how AI advancements impact labor income, finding that improvements in AI capabilities where machines initially underperform humans decrease total labor income, while improvements in areas where machines outperform humans increase it, leading to a potential initial decline before an eventual rise. Optimal AI development for maximizing labor income involves strategically focusing on AI strengths and weaknesses relative to human capabilities."

    "title": "In the Shadow of Smith's Invisible Hand: Risks to Economic Stability and Social Wellbeing in the Age of Intelligence",
    "published_date": "2024-04-22",
    "abstract": "Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing financial security, identity, purpose, and social integration. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job displacement. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour underutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index by 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary. Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study underscores the need for governments, civic organisations, and business to work together to ensure a smooth transition to an AI- dominated economy to safeguard the Mental Wealth of nations.",

    "summary": "A system dynamics model predicts that even moderate increases in AI adoption could drastically increase labor underutilization and decrease per capita income by mid-2050, highlighting the urgent need for proactive government intervention and job creation to mitigate potential economic instability. The study suggests a threshold beyond which job creation alone cannot prevent economic decline, emphasizing the need for context-specific policy responses."

    "published_date": "2023-12-09",
    "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape the knowledge economy by enabling problem solving at scale. This paper introduces a framework to analyze this transformation, incorporating AI into an economy where humans form hierarchical firms to use their time efficiently: Less knowledgeable individuals become\"workers\"solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable individuals become\"solvers\"assisting workers with exceptional problems. We model AI as a technology that transforms computing power into\"AI agents,\"which can either operate autonomously (as co-workers or solvers/co-pilots) or non-autonomously (only as co-pilots). We show that basic autonomous AI displaces humans towards specialized problem solving, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced autonomous AI reallocates humans to routine work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. While autonomous AI primarily benefits the most knowledgeable individuals, non-autonomous AI disproportionately benefits the least knowledgeable. However, autonomous AI achieves higher overall output. These findings reconcile seemingly contradictory empirical evidence and reveal key tradeoffs involved in regulating AI autonomy.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on hierarchical firms within a knowledge economy, finding that basic autonomous AI leads to smaller, less productive firms while advanced autonomous AI results in larger, more productive ones, with differing distributional effects depending on AI autonomy levels. The model reveals tradeoffs in regulating AI autonomy based on its impact on firm structure and overall output."
