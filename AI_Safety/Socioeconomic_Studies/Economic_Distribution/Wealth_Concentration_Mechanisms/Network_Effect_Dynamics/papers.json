    "title": "Distinguishing ways AI can be \"concentrated\"",
    "published_date": "2024-10-21",
    "summary": "The article argues that discussions of AI concentration are unclear, proposing three distinct dimensions: concentration of AI development, service provisioning, and control. These dimensions are independent and crucial for accurately predicting AI's trajectory and informing policy."

    "published_date": "2023-02-07",
    "summary": "This article examines the application of game theory to AI development within organizational structures, highlighting both its benefits in multi-agent systems and limitations regarding organizational dynamics. It argues that despite AI advancements, bureaucratic structures, characterized by hierarchical authority and specialized tasks, will remain necessary for efficient problem-solving due to limitations in a single AI's processing capabilities."

    "published_date": "2023-12-20",
    "summary": "The article proposes Gaia, a decentralized network leveraging existing technologies and economic mechanisms to address AI safety by building a shared world model, achieving Open Agency Architecture goals through iterative improvement and distributed collaboration. This approach prioritizes practical implementation and wide adoption over a top-down, technocratic solution."

    "published_date": "2021-06-04",
    "summary": "The article explores applying game theory to AI development within organizational structures, highlighting the limitations of a purely game-theoretic approach and emphasizing the enduring relevance of bureaucratic principles like hierarchical authority and specialization, even with the integration of AI agents. The authors argue that human-AI collaboration, leveraging comparative advantage, remains crucial for efficient problem-solving and goal achievement in complex environments."

    "title": "Some thoughts on risks from narrow, non-agentic AI",
    "published_date": "2021-01-19",
    "summary": "The article explores potential risks of advanced AI, focusing on the concentration of power leading to societal harm, either through misaligned superintelligent AI or through exacerbating economic inequality and potentially enabling totalitarianism. The author questions whether historical patterns of moral progress will continue amidst drastically increased inequality driven by AI-induced automation."

    "published_date": "2021-10-14",
    "summary": "This article explores the role of compute in AI governance, arguing that its physical infrastructure, energy demands, and concentrated supply chain make it a relatively governable aspect of AI development. The author suggests that controlling access to compute resources could improve AI safety by restricting access for less cautious actors."

    "summary": "This article, part one of a four-part series, introduces a simplified model of computation focusing on digital computers and their role in AI. It explores the relationship between compute trends (processing power, memory, interconnect) and the development of increasingly capable AI systems."

    "title": "The Architecture of Power: Patterns of Disruption and Stability in the Global Ownership Network",
    "abstract": "It is today widely understood that the global economy is a densely interconnected network that affects the everyday lives of billions of people. In particular, the network structure can amplify financial instability, exacerbate wealth and income inequality, and hamper investments in climate change mitigation. However, little is known about how the global economic network evolves over time and specifically how a major disruptive event, such as the 2008 financial crisis, may have reshaped its structure. Here we show that, although many actors gain or lose their position of influence over time, overall, economic power structures are remarkably robust to shocks and that power remains extremely concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and organisations. While previous works have been restricted by limitations, our analysis represents the first comprehensive analysis of the entire global ownership network over time. Our results provide an explanation for how a global economic shock, while negatively affecting many individuals can have only a marginal impact on the existing power structures.",

    "summary": "Analysis of the global ownership network reveals that despite fluctuations in individual influence, power remains highly concentrated and surprisingly resilient to major shocks like the 2008 financial crisis. This persistence of concentrated power explains how such crises negatively impact many individuals while leaving overall power structures largely unchanged."
