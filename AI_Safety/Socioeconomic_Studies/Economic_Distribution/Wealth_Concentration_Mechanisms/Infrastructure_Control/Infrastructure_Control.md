### Mini Description

Analysis of how control over key AI infrastructure (computing resources, data centers, specialized hardware) contributes to wealth concentration

### Description

Infrastructure control in AI systems examines how ownership and access to critical computational resources shapes wealth concentration and market power. This encompasses physical infrastructure like data centers, specialized AI accelerator hardware, and high-bandwidth networking, as well as the technical expertise and operational capabilities needed to effectively deploy and maintain these resources at scale. The concentration of these infrastructure components creates significant barriers to entry and enables incumbent advantages that can perpetuate economic disparities.

A key focus is understanding how different infrastructure ownership models and access patterns influence market dynamics and innovation. This includes analyzing how cloud computing platforms create dependencies for AI development, how hardware supply chains affect competitive landscapes, and how geographic distribution of computing resources impacts global AI capabilities. Researchers examine both technical requirements for infrastructure scaling and economic factors that determine who can effectively compete in infrastructure-intensive AI development.

The field also investigates potential interventions to address infrastructure-based concentration, including regulatory frameworks for ensuring fair access, technical standards for interoperability, and alternative ownership models such as computing commons or distributed infrastructure networks. This involves studying how different governance structures might enable broader participation in AI development while maintaining the efficiency benefits of large-scale infrastructure.
