### Mini Description

Analysis of how AI-driven economic changes affect wealth transfer between generations and long-term patterns of economic inequality

### Description

Intergenerational effects in AI safety research examines how artificial intelligence technologies influence the transfer and accumulation of economic resources, opportunities, and advantages across generations. This includes studying how AI-driven changes in labor markets, asset ownership, and skill requirements create lasting impacts that shape economic mobility and inequality over multiple generations. The field analyzes both direct mechanisms, such as changes in inheritance patterns and educational advantages, and indirect effects through shifts in social and economic structures.

A key focus is understanding how AI technologies may create or amplify dynastic advantages through various channels. This includes studying how early adoption of AI technologies by certain families or groups can create compounding benefits in wealth, education, and career opportunities that persist across generations. Researchers examine how AI-driven changes in labor markets might affect different cohorts' lifetime earnings potential and ability to accumulate wealth, potentially creating new patterns of intergenerational dependency or mobility.

The field emphasizes developing predictive models and measurement frameworks to assess long-term distributional impacts across generations. This involves analyzing how AI deployment might affect traditional mechanisms of social mobility, such as education and entrepreneurship, and identifying potential intervention points to prevent the entrenchment of AI-driven advantages. Researchers also study how different policy approaches, such as inheritance taxes, universal basic income, or educational subsidies, might influence the intergenerational transmission of AI-related economic benefits and disadvantages.
