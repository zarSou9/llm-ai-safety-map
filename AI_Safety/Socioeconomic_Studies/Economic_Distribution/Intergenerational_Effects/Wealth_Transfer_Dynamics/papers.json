    "title": "Generative AI Triggers Welfare-Reducing Decisions in Humans",
    "published_date": "2024-01-23",
    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape the way individuals communicate and interact. While this form of AI has the potential to efficiently make numerous human decisions, there is limited understanding of how individuals respond to its use in social interaction. In particular, it remains unclear how individuals engage with algorithms when the interaction entails consequences for other people. Here, we report the results of a large-scale pre-registered online experiment (N = 3,552) indicating diminished fairness, trust, trustworthiness, cooperation, and coordination by human players in economic twoplayer games, when the decision of the interaction partner is taken over by ChatGPT. On the contrary, we observe no adverse welfare effects when individuals are uncertain about whether they are interacting with a human or generative AI. Therefore, the promotion of AI transparency, often suggested as a solution to mitigate the negative impacts of generative AI on society, shows a detrimental effect on welfare in our study. Concurrently, participants frequently delegate decisions to ChatGPT, particularly when the AI's involvement is undisclosed, and individuals struggle to discern between AI and human decisions.",

    "summary": "A large-scale experiment revealed that human participants in economic games exhibited reduced fairness, trust, and cooperation when interacting with a ChatGPT-controlled partner, unlike when uncertainty existed about the partner's AI nature; this suggests that AI transparency may negatively impact welfare."

    "title": "In the Shadow of Smith's Invisible Hand: Risks to Economic Stability and Social Wellbeing in the Age of Intelligence",
    "published_date": "2024-04-22",
    "abstract": "Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing financial security, identity, purpose, and social integration. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job displacement. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour underutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index by 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary. Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study underscores the need for governments, civic organisations, and business to work together to ensure a smooth transition to an AI- dominated economy to safeguard the Mental Wealth of nations.",

    "summary": "A system dynamics model suggests that even moderate increases in AI adoption could significantly increase unemployment and decrease disposable income by mid-2050, necessitating substantial job creation or government intervention to prevent economic instability. The findings highlight a potential threshold of AI adoption beyond which even high job creation rates cannot mitigate negative economic consequences."

    "title": "Cultural Transmission, Technology, and Treatment of the Elderly",
    "published_date": "2024-07-12",
    "abstract": "We discuss the interrelationship between the treatment of the elderly, the nature of production, and the transmission of culture. Respect for the elderly is endogenous. Parents cultivate an interest in consuming culture in their children; when they are older, children compensate their elders proportional to the degree to which their interests were previously cultivated. We show that this model is functionally equivalent to one in which cultural goods are transferred across generations. We focus on the relative well-being of the elderly and use the model to explain patterns in their relative well-being across societies. An important theme is that the cultivation of culture and norms for the respect and support of the elderly bear a nonlinear relationship with many economic variables, such as capital and or land intensity in production. We also discuss the interaction of property rights with production, assets such as productive resources, and relative treatment of the elderly. Insecurity of some types of property rights, such as rights over output, may benefit the elderly, while secure rights over productive resources may also benefit the elderly. We discuss how the elderly could be affected by demographic, technological and policy changes in both developing and developed economies.",
    "summary": "This paper models the relationship between cultural transmission, economic factors (like production methods and property rights), and the treatment of the elderly, arguing that intergenerational cultural cultivation directly impacts the well-being of elders in a non-linear way across societies. The model explains observed cross-societal variations in elder care based on these interacting factors."

    "title": "Artificial Generational Intelligence: Cultural Accumulation in Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2024-06-01",
    "abstract": "Cultural accumulation drives the open-ended and diverse progress in capabilities spanning human history. It builds an expanding body of knowledge and skills by combining individual exploration with inter-generational information transmission. Despite its widespread success among humans, the capacity for artificial learning agents to accumulate culture remains under-explored. In particular, approaches to reinforcement learning typically strive for improvements over only a single lifetime. Generational algorithms that do exist fail to capture the open-ended, emergent nature of cultural accumulation, which allows individuals to trade-off innovation and imitation. Building on the previously demonstrated ability for reinforcement learning agents to perform social learning, we find that training setups which balance this with independent learning give rise to cultural accumulation. These accumulating agents outperform those trained for a single lifetime with the same cumulative experience. We explore this accumulation by constructing two models under two distinct notions of a generation: episodic generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-context learning and train-time generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-weights learning. In-context and in-weights cultural accumulation can be interpreted as analogous to knowledge and skill accumulation, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present general models that achieve emergent cultural accumulation in reinforcement learning, opening up new avenues towards more open-ended learning systems, as well as presenting new opportunities for modelling human culture.",
    "citation_count": 3,
    "summary": "This paper introduces artificial generational intelligence models that achieve emergent cultural accumulation in reinforcement learning, surpassing single-lifetime learning agents by balancing independent exploration with social learning across episodic and train-time generations. This demonstrates, for the first time, general models capable of open-ended learning analogous to human cultural progress."

    "published_date": "2023-04-02",
    "abstract": "Wealth distribution is a complex and critical aspect of any society. Information exchange is considered to have played a role in shaping wealth distribution patterns, but the specific dynamic mechanism is still unclear. In this research, we used simulation-based methods to investigate the impact of different modes of information exchange on wealth distribution. We compared different combinations of information exchange strategies and moving strategies, analyzed their impact on wealth distribution using classic wealth distribution indicators such as the Gini coefficient. Our findings suggest that information exchange strategies have significant impact on wealth distribution and that promoting more equitable access to information and resources is crucial in building a just and equitable society for all.",
    "summary": "This paper uses simulations to show that different information exchange strategies significantly impact wealth distribution, suggesting that equitable information access is key to a more equitable society."

    "title": "The Transformative Effects of AI on International Economics",
    "published_date": "2023-12-09",
    "abstract": "As AI adoption accelerates, research on its economic impacts becomes a salient source to consider for stakeholders of AI policy. Such research is however still in its infancy, and one in need of review. This paper aims to accomplish just that and is structured around two main themes. Firstly, the path towards transformative AI, and secondly the wealth created by it. It is found that sectors most embedded into global value chains will drive economic impacts, hence special attention is paid to the international trade perspective. When it comes to the path towards transformative AI, research is heterogenous in its predictions, with some predicting rapid, unhindered adoption, and others taking a more conservative view based on potential bottlenecks and comparisons to past disruptive technologies. As for wealth creation, while some agreement is to be found in AI's growth boosting abilities, predictions on timelines are lacking. Consensus exists however around the dispersion of AI induced wealth, which is heavily biased towards developed countries due to phenomena such as anchoring and reduced bargaining power of developing countries. Finally, a shortcoming of economic growth models in failing to consider AI risk is discovered. Based on the review, a calculated, and slower adoption rate of AI technologies is recommended.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "This paper reviews the nascent research on AI's impact on international economics, finding heterogeneous predictions on AI adoption speed but consensus that AI will boost growth, albeit unevenly favoring developed countries due to existing inequalities. A cautious, measured approach to AI adoption is recommended."
