### Mini Description

Analysis of how AI technologies affect patterns of inheritance, asset accumulation, and wealth transfer between generations

### Description

Wealth transfer dynamics in the context of AI safety examines how artificial intelligence technologies reshape traditional patterns of intergenerational wealth transmission. This includes analyzing how AI-driven changes in asset values, investment opportunities, and wealth accumulation mechanisms affect the ability of different generations to build and transfer economic resources. The research particularly focuses on how AI technologies might create new forms of inheritable advantages, such as proprietary algorithms, data assets, or early-mover benefits in AI-transformed markets.

A critical aspect of this research involves understanding how AI technologies affect different forms of wealth transfer, both formal (like inheritance and gifts) and informal (such as human capital investment and network access). Researchers examine how AI deployment might alter the relative importance of different types of transferable assets, potentially shifting emphasis from traditional physical and financial capital to new forms of digital and intellectual property. This includes studying how AI-enabled automation and digital transformation affect the long-term value and transferability of various asset classes.

The field also investigates how AI technologies influence the effectiveness and equity of existing wealth transfer mechanisms and regulations. This encompasses analyzing how AI might affect estate planning, trust structures, and inheritance tax systems, as well as studying how technological changes might require new legal and policy frameworks to address emerging forms of transferable wealth. Researchers particularly focus on identifying potential interventions to prevent AI from exacerbating existing disparities in wealth transfer capabilities across different socioeconomic groups.
