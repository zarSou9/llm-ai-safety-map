    "title": "Effects of AI Feedback on Learning, the Skill Gap, and Intellectual Diversity",
    "published_date": "2024-09-27",
    "abstract": "Can human decision-makers learn from AI feedback? Using data on 52,000 decision-makers from a large online chess platform, we investigate how their AI use affects three interrelated long-term outcomes: Learning, skill gap, and diversity of decision strategies. First, we show that individuals are far more likely to seek AI feedback in situations in which they experienced success rather than failure. This AI feedback seeking strategy turns out to be detrimental to learning: Feedback on successes decreases future performance, while feedback on failures increases it. Second, higher-skilled decision-makers seek AI feedback more often and are far more likely to seek AI feedback after a failure, and benefit more from AI feedback than lower-skilled individuals. As a result, access to AI feedback increases, rather than decreases, the skill gap between high- and low-skilled individuals. Finally, we leverage 42 major platform updates as natural experiments to show that access to AI feedback causes a decrease in intellectual diversity of the population as individuals tend to specialize in the same areas. Together, those results indicate that learning from AI feedback is not automatic and using AI correctly seems to be a skill itself. Furthermore, despite its individual-level benefits, access to AI feedback can have significant population-level downsides including loss of intellectual diversity and an increasing skill gap.",
    "summary": "A study of chess players reveals that while AI feedback improves high-skilled players' performance, it hinders learning in low-skilled players and reduces overall strategic diversity, widening the skill gap and harming intellectual diversity within the player population. This highlights that effectively utilizing AI feedback is a skill in itself, not an automatic path to improvement."

    "title": "Artificial Generational Intelligence: Cultural Accumulation in Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2024-06-01",
    "abstract": "Cultural accumulation drives the open-ended and diverse progress in capabilities spanning human history. It builds an expanding body of knowledge and skills by combining individual exploration with inter-generational information transmission. Despite its widespread success among humans, the capacity for artificial learning agents to accumulate culture remains under-explored. In particular, approaches to reinforcement learning typically strive for improvements over only a single lifetime. Generational algorithms that do exist fail to capture the open-ended, emergent nature of cultural accumulation, which allows individuals to trade-off innovation and imitation. Building on the previously demonstrated ability for reinforcement learning agents to perform social learning, we find that training setups which balance this with independent learning give rise to cultural accumulation. These accumulating agents outperform those trained for a single lifetime with the same cumulative experience. We explore this accumulation by constructing two models under two distinct notions of a generation: episodic generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-context learning and train-time generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-weights learning. In-context and in-weights cultural accumulation can be interpreted as analogous to knowledge and skill accumulation, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present general models that achieve emergent cultural accumulation in reinforcement learning, opening up new avenues towards more open-ended learning systems, as well as presenting new opportunities for modelling human culture.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework that enables artificial agents to accumulate culture over generations, surpassing single-lifetime learners through a balanced approach of individual exploration and social learning (imitation). Two models are presented, demonstrating both in-context (knowledge) and in-weights (skill) cultural accumulation."

    "title": "Skills or Degree? The Rise of Skill-Based Hiring for AI and Green Jobs",
    "published_date": "2023-12-19",
    "abstract": "Emerging professions in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sustainability (green jobs) are experiencing labour shortages as industry demand outpaces labour supply. In this context, our study aims to understand whether employers have begun focusing more on individual skills rather than formal qualifications in their recruitment processes. We analysed a large time-series dataset of approximately eleven million online job vacancies in the UK from 2018 to mid-2024, drawing on diverse literature on technological change and labour market signalling. Our findings provide evidence that employers have initiated\"skill-based hiring\"for AI roles, adopting more flexible hiring practices to expand the available talent pool. From 2018-2023, demand for AI roles grew by 21% as a proportion of all postings (and accelerated into 2024). Simultaneously, mentions of university education requirements for AI roles declined by 15%. Our regression analysis shows that university degrees have a significantly lower wage premium for both AI and green roles. In contrast, AI skills command a wage premium of 23%, exceeding the value of degrees up until the PhD-level (33%). In occupations with high demand for AI skills, the premium for skills is high, and the reward for degrees is relatively low. We recommend leveraging alternative skill-building formats such as apprenticeships, on-the-job training, MOOCs, vocational education and training, micro-certificates, and online bootcamps to fully utilise human capital and address talent shortages.",
    "citation_count": 3,
    "summary": "A study of UK job postings from 2018-2024 reveals that, in high-demand fields like AI and green jobs, employers are increasingly prioritizing skills over formal degrees in hiring, with AI skills commanding a significant wage premium. This shift reflects a move towards more flexible hiring practices to address talent shortages."

    "title": "Are high school degrees and university diplomas equally heritable in the US? A new measure of relative intergenerational mobility",
    "published_date": "2023-03-15",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new measure of relative intergenerational mobility along the educational trait as a proxy of inequality of opportunity. The new measure is more suitable for controlling for the variations in the trait distributions of individuals and their parents than the commonly used intergenerational persistence coefficient. This point is illustrated by our empirical analysis of US census data from the period between 1960 and 2015: we show that controlling for the variations in the trait distributions adequately is vital in assessing the part of intergenerational mobility which is not caused by the educational expansion. Failing to do so can potentially reverse the relative priority of various policies aiming at reducing the\"heritability\"of high school degrees and tertiary education diplomas.",
    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel measure of relative intergenerational mobility in education, superior to existing methods in accounting for changing educational attainment distributions. Using US Census data (1960-2015), it demonstrates that accurately controlling for these distributions is crucial for evaluating educational inequality and the effectiveness of related policies."

    "published_date": "2023-05-15",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the causal impact of negatively and positively toned ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence (AI) discussions on US students' anticipated labor market outcomes. Our findings reveal students reduce their confidence regarding their future earnings prospects after exposure to AI debates, and this effect is more pronounced after reading discussion excerpts with a negative tone. Unlike STEM majors, students in Non-STEM fields show asymmetric and pessimistic belief changes, suggesting that they might feel more vulnerable to emerging AI technologies. Pessimistic belief updates regarding future earnings are also prevalent among non-male students, indicating widespread AI concerns among vulnerable student subgroups. Educators, administrators, and policymakers may regularly engage with students to address their concerns and enhance educational curricula to better prepare them for a future that AI will inevitably shape.",
    "citation_count": 2,
    "summary": "Exposure to discussions about ChatGPT and AI negatively impacts US students' expected future earnings, particularly among non-STEM majors and non-male students, with negative-toned discussions exacerbating this effect. This suggests a need for proactive educational interventions addressing AI's impact on the labor market."

    "title": "The Economic Effect of Gaining a New Qualification Later in Life",
    "published_date": "2023-04-04",
    "abstract": "Pursuing educational qualifications later in life is an increasingly common phenomenon within OECD countries since technological change and automation continues to drive the evolution of skills needed in many professions. We focus on the causal impacts to economic returns of degrees completed later in life, where motivations and capabilities to acquire additional education may be distinct from education in early years. We find that completing an additional degree leads to more than \\$3000 (AUD, 2019) extra income per year compared to those who do not complete additional study. For outcomes, treatment and controls we use the extremely rich and nationally representative longitudinal data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia survey (HILDA). To take full advantage of the complexity and richness of this data we use a Machine Learning (ML) based methodology for causal effect estimation. We are also able to use ML to discover sources of heterogeneity in the effects of gaining additional qualifications. For example, those younger than 45 years of age when obtaining additional qualifications tend to reap more benefits (as much as \\$50 per week more) than others.",
    "summary": "Using Australian longitudinal data and machine learning, this study finds that obtaining an additional degree later in life increases annual income by over $3000 AUD (2019), with individuals under 45 experiencing even greater benefits."

    "published_date": "2023-11-14",
    "abstract": "What will likely be the effect of the emergence of ChatGPT and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI) on the skill premium? To address this question, we develop a nested constant elasticity of substitution production function that distinguishes between industrial robots and AI. Industrial robots predominantly substitute for low-skill workers, whereas AI mainly helps to perform the tasks of high-skill workers. We show that AI reduces the skill premium as long as it is more substitutable for high-skill workers than low-skill workers are for high-skill workers.",
    "citation_count": 7,
    "summary": "This paper examines the impact of AI on the skill premium, modeling AI as a complement to high-skill labor and a substitute for low-skill labor. The authors find that AI reduces the skill premium if its substitutability for high-skill workers is greater than that of low-skill workers for high-skill workers."
