### Mini Description

Analysis of how AI-powered digital platforms reshape labor markets through new intermediation models and the transformation of traditional employment relationships into gig work

### Description

Platform Economy Evolution research examines how AI-driven digital platforms are fundamentally restructuring labor markets and employment relationships. This includes studying how platforms use AI algorithms for matching, pricing, and coordination between service providers and consumers, as well as analyzing the economic and social implications of the shift from traditional employment to platform-mediated work. Researchers investigate how these platforms create new markets, transform existing industries, and reshape the nature of work itself.

A central focus is understanding the mechanisms through which platforms exercise control and influence over workers, including algorithmic management practices, reputation systems, and dynamic pricing models. This involves analyzing how platforms use AI to optimize market efficiency while potentially creating new forms of precarity and dependency for workers. Researchers examine how platform design choices and algorithmic decisions affect worker autonomy, earning potential, and job quality, while also studying the emergence of worker resistance and collective action in platform contexts.

The field also investigates how platform economies scale and evolve over time, including network effects, market concentration dynamics, and the global spread of platform models across different sectors. This encompasses studying how platforms navigate regulatory environments, compete with traditional businesses, and adapt their models to different cultural and economic contexts. Particular attention is paid to identifying sustainable platform models that can balance efficiency gains with worker protections and social welfare considerations.
