    "title": "Building AI Research Fleets",
    "published_date": "2025-01-12",
    "summary": "Research automation will not simply replace individual scientists with AI, but rather transform research into coordinated \"fleets\" of specialized AI agents working collaboratively. This requires institutions to adapt their structures and workflows to manage these AI teams effectively, moving beyond traditional academic models."

    "title": "Exploring Human-AI Collaboration in Agile: Customised LLM Meeting Assistants",
    "published_date": "2024-04-23",
    "abstract": "This action research study focuses on the integration of\"AI assistants\"in two Agile software development meetings: the Daily Scrum and a feature refinement, a planning meeting that is part of an in-house Scaled Agile framework. We discuss the critical drivers of success, and establish a link between the use of AI and team collaboration dynamics. We conclude with a list of lessons learnt during the interventions in an industrial context, and provide a assessment checklist for companies and teams to reflect on their readiness level. This paper is thus a road-map to facilitate the integration of AI tools in Agile setups.",

    "summary": "This action research study investigates the impact of custom large language model (LLM) meeting assistants on Agile software development team collaboration, specifically within Daily Scrums and feature refinement meetings. The study identifies key success factors, team dynamics influences, and provides a checklist for organizations considering similar AI integration."

    "title": "Gradient Routing: Masking Gradients to Localize Computation in Neural Networks",
    "published_date": "2024-12-06",
    "summary": "Gradient routing is a technique that controls where learning occurs in neural networks by applying masks to gradients during backpropagation, enabling the creation of specialized subcomponents within a model. This allows for increased transparency, removal of sensitive capabilities, and improved control over model behavior, as demonstrated in applications ranging from MNIST autoencoders to language models and reinforcement learning."

    "title": "Generative AI at Work",
    "published_date": "2023-04-01",
    "abstract": "We study the staggered introduction of a generative AI-based conversational assistant using data from 5,172 customer support agents. Access to AI assistance increases worker productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 15\\% on average, with substantial heterogeneity across workers. Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve both the speed and quality of their output while the most experienced and highest-skilled workers see small gains in speed and small declines in quality. We also find evidence that AI assistance facilitates worker learning and improves English fluency, particularly among international agents. While AI systems improve with more training data, we find that the gains from AI adoption are largest for relatively rare problems, where human agents have less baseline training and experience. Finally, we provide evidence that AI assistance improves the experience of work along two key dimensions: customers are more polite and less likely to ask to speak to a manager.",

    "title": "Human-AI Collaboration: The Effect of AI Delegation on Human Task Performance and Task Satisfaction",
    "published_date": "2023-03-16",
    "abstract": "Recent work has proposed artificial intelligence (AI) models that can learn to decide whether to make a prediction for an instance of a task or to delegate it to a human by considering both parties' capabilities. In simulations with synthetically generated or context-independent human predictions, delegation can help improve the performance of human-AI teamsâ€”compared to humans or the AI model completing the task alone. However, so far, it remains unclear how humans perform and how they perceive the task when they are aware that an AI model delegated task instances to them. In an experimental study with 196 participants, we show that task performance and task satisfaction improve through AI delegation, regardless of whether humans are aware of the delegation. Additionally, we identify humans' increased levels of self-efficacy as the underlying mechanism for these improvements in performance and satisfaction. Our findings provide initial evidence that allowing AI models to take over more management responsibilities can be an effective form of human-AI collaboration in workplaces.",

    "summary": "An experimental study demonstrated that AI delegation of tasks to humans improves both task performance and satisfaction, regardless of human awareness, by increasing self-efficacy. This suggests that allowing AI to manage task allocation can enhance human-AI collaboration."
