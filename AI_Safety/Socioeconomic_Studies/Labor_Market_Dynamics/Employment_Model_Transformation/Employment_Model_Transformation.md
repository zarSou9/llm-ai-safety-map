### Mini Description

Analysis of how AI reshapes traditional employment relationships, including the rise of platform work, remote work, and new organizational structures

### Description

Employment Model Transformation research examines how AI technologies fundamentally alter traditional employer-employee relationships, work arrangements, and organizational structures. This includes studying the emergence of new employment paradigms like algorithmic management, digital labor platforms, and hybrid human-AI workforces. Researchers analyze how these changes affect job security, worker autonomy, performance evaluation methods, and the legal frameworks governing employment relationships.

A key focus is understanding how AI enables and accelerates the shift toward more flexible, distributed, and automated work arrangements. This includes examining the rise of gig economy platforms, remote work infrastructure, and AI-driven talent matching systems. Researchers investigate how these changes impact workplace dynamics, organizational hierarchies, and the boundaries between full-time employment, contract work, and automated processes.

The field also explores how AI transforms organizational decision-making and management practices, including recruitment, task allocation, performance monitoring, and career development. This involves studying the implications of algorithmic management systems, the evolution of workplace surveillance technologies, and the changing nature of human supervision and leadership in AI-augmented organizations. Particular attention is paid to understanding how these transformations affect worker well-being, job satisfaction, and professional development opportunities.
