    "title": "GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models",
    "published_date": "2023-03-17",
    "abstract": "We investigate the potential implications of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), on the U.S. labor market, focusing on the increased capabilities arising from LLM-powered software compared to LLMs on their own. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56% of all tasks. This finding implies that LLM-powered software will have a substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs could significantly impact the US labor market, with up to 80% of workers experiencing at least 10% of their tasks affected and potentially 19% seeing over half their tasks impacted, particularly higher-income jobs; LLM-powered software greatly amplifies this effect, potentially automating 47-56% of all worker tasks."

    "title": "The Turing Valley: How AI Capabilities Shape Labor Income",
    "published_date": "2024-08-29",
    "abstract": "Do improvements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) benefit workers? We study how AI capabilities influence labor income in a competitive economy where production requires multidimensional knowledge, and firms organize production by matching humans and AI-powered machines in hierarchies designed to use knowledge efficiently. We show that advancements in AI in dimensions where machines underperform humans decrease total labor income, while advancements in dimensions where machines outperform humans increase it. Hence, if AI initially underperforms humans in all dimensions and improves gradually, total labor income initially declines before rising. We also characterize the AI that maximizes labor income. When humans are sufficiently weak in all knowledge dimensions, labor income is maximized when AI is as good as possible in all dimensions. Otherwise, labor income is maximized when AI simultaneously performs as poorly as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively strong and as well as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively weak. Our results suggest that choosing the direction of AI development can create significant divisions between the interests of labor and capital.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of AI advancements on labor income, finding that improvements in AI capabilities initially decrease total labor income if AI initially underperforms humans, before eventually increasing it; the optimal AI for maximizing labor income depends on the relative strengths and weaknesses of human workers compared to AI."

    "title": "Rideshare Transparency: Translating Gig Worker Insights on AI Platform Design to Policy",
    "published_date": "2024-06-16",
    "abstract": "Rideshare platforms exert significant control over workers through algorithmic systems that can result in financial, emotional, and physical harm. What steps can platforms, designers, and practitioners take to mitigate these negative impacts and meet worker needs? In this paper, through a novel mixed methods study combining a LLM-based analysis of over 1 million comments posted to online platform worker communities with semi-structured interviews of workers, we thickly characterize transparency-related harms, mitigation strategies, and worker needs while validating and contextualizing our findings within the broader worker community. Our findings expose a transparency gap between existing platform designs and the information drivers need, particularly concerning promotions, fares, routes, and task allocation. Our analysis suggests that rideshare workers need key pieces of information, which we refer to as indicators, to make informed work decisions. These indicators include details about rides, driver statistics, algorithmic implementation details, and platform policy information. We argue that instead of relying on platforms to include such information in their designs, new regulations that require platforms to publish public transparency reports may be a more effective solution to improve worker well-being. We offer recommendations for implementing such a policy.",

    "summary": "This paper uses a mixed-methods approach to analyze over one million online comments and worker interviews, revealing a transparency gap in rideshare platforms concerning crucial information affecting driver well-being. The authors argue that mandated public transparency reports, rather than relying on platform design changes, are a more effective solution to mitigate worker harms."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence in the Knowledge Economy",
    "published_date": "2023-12-09",
    "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape the knowledge economy by enabling problem solving at scale. This paper introduces a framework to analyze this transformation, incorporating AI into an economy where humans form hierarchical firms to use their time efficiently: Less knowledgeable individuals become\"workers\"solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable individuals become\"solvers\"assisting workers with exceptional problems. We model AI as a technology that transforms computing power into\"AI agents,\"which can either operate autonomously (as co-workers or solvers/co-pilots) or non-autonomously (only as co-pilots). We show that basic autonomous AI displaces humans towards specialized problem solving, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced autonomous AI reallocates humans to routine work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. While autonomous AI primarily benefits the most knowledgeable individuals, non-autonomous AI disproportionately benefits the least knowledgeable. However, autonomous AI achieves higher overall output. These findings reconcile seemingly contradictory empirical evidence and reveal key tradeoffs involved in regulating AI autonomy.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the knowledge economy, showing that basic autonomous AI leads to smaller, less productive firms while advanced autonomous AI fosters larger, more productive, and decentralized ones, with differing distributional effects depending on AI autonomy level. The model highlights the trade-offs involved in regulating AI autonomy and its impact on overall productivity and worker specialization."

    "title": "Endogenous Labour Flow Networks",
    "published_date": "2023-01-19",
    "abstract": "In the last decade, the study of labour dynamics has led to the introduction of labour flow networks (LFNs) as a way to conceptualise job-to-job transitions, and to the development of mathematical models to explore the dynamics of these networked flows. To date, LFN models have relied upon an assumption of static network structure. However, as recent events (increasing automation in the workplace, the COVID-19 pandemic, a surge in the demand for programming skills, etc.) have shown, we are experiencing drastic shifts to the job landscape that are altering the ways individuals navigate the labour market. Here we develop a novel model that emerges LFNs from agent-level behaviour, removing the necessity of assuming that future job-to-job flows will be along the same paths where they have been historically observed. This model, informed by microdata for the United Kingdom, generates empirical LFNs with a high level of accuracy. We use the model to explore how shocks impacting the underlying distributions of jobs and wages alter the topology of the LFN. This framework represents a crucial step towards the development of models that can answer questions about the future of work in an ever-changing world.",
    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel model of endogenous labor flow networks, generating realistic network structures from agent-level behavior rather than relying on static assumptions. The model, validated using UK microdata, allows for exploration of how external shocks impact labor market dynamics and network topology."

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper explores a neglected normative dimension of algorithmic opacity in the workplace and the labor market. It argues that explanations of algorithms and algorithmic decisions are of noninstrumental value. That is because explanations of the structure and function of parts of the social world form the basis for reflective clarification of our practical orientation toward the institutions that play a central role in our life. Using this account of the noninstrumental value of explanations, the paper diagnoses distinctive normative defects in the workplace and economic institutions which a reliance on AI can encourage, and which lead to alienation.",

    "title": "Can Artificial Intelligence Boost Employment in Service Industries? Empirical Analysis Based on China",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Based on the provincial panel data of China during 2007–2020, this study examines the temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics of artificial intelligence (AI) development and service industry employment, using the fixed-effect model to analyze the influence mechanism of AI development on service industry employment. We analyzed the regional heterogeneity. The results revealed the following: (i) AI experts a direct and indirect impact on the service industry employment. The direct impact is manifested in the creation effect and substitution effect, while the indirect impact is manifested in the competition effect. These effects exert a positive and significant indigenous impact on the service industry employment: increasing the number of jobs, optimizing the employment structure, and increasing employment income; (ii) Subregional studies demonstrated that the impact of AI development on employment in services has regional heterogeneity, which is conducive to narrowing regional differences in services; (iii) Cross-industry studies reported that AI development has augmented cross-industry inflows of labor and increased job competition for medium-skilled labor. This study is utmost significance to improve the employment policy of China's service industry, optimize the training system of service talents, promote the upgrading of the service industry, and promote the synchronized development of the regional service industry.",

    "published_date": "2021-03-24",
    "abstract": "The emergence of the modern gig economy introduces a new set of employment considerations for firms and laborers that include various trade-offs. With a game-theoretical approach, we examine the influences of technology, policy and markets on firm and worker preferences for gig labor. Theoretically, we present new conceptual extensions to the replicator equation and model oscillating dynamics in two-player asymmetric bi-matrix games with time-evolving environments, introducing concepts of the attractor arc, trapping zone and escape. While canonical applications of evolutionary game theory focus on the evolutionary stable strategy, our model assumes that the system exhibits oscillatory dynamics and can persist for long temporal intervals in a pseudo-stable state. We demonstrate how changing market conditions result in distinct evolutionary patterns across labor economies. Informing tensions regarding the future of this new employment category, we present a novel payoff framework to analyze the role of technology on the growth of the gig economy. Regarding governance, we explore regulatory implications within the gig economy, demonstrating how intervals of lenient and strict policy alter firm and worker sensitivities between gig and employee labor strategies. Finally, we establish an aggregate economic framework to explain how technology, policy and market environments engage in an interlocking dance, a balancing act, to sustain the observable co-existence of gig and employee labor strategies.",

    "summary": "This paper uses evolutionary game theory to model the dynamic interplay between technology, policy, and market forces in shaping firm and worker preferences for gig versus traditional employment in the gig economy, finding that oscillatory dynamics and persistent pseudo-stable states characterize this complex system. The model reveals how these factors influence the coexistence and evolution of gig and employee labor strategies."
