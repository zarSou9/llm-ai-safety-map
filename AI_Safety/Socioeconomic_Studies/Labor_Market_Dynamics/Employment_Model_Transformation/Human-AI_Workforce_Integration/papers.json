    "title": "Intuitive interaction flow: A Dual-Loop Human-Machine Collaboration Task Allocation Model and an experimental study",
    "published_date": "2024-10-10",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the issue of task allocation in Human-Machine Collaboration (HMC) within the context of Industry 4.0. By integrating philosophical insights and cognitive science, it clearly defines two typical modes of human behavior in human-machine interaction(HMI): skill-based intuitive behavior and knowledge-based intellectual behavior. Building on this, the concept of 'intuitive interaction flow' is innovatively introduced by combining human intuition with machine humanoid intelligence, leading to the construction of a dual-loop HMC task allocation model. Through comparative experiments measuring electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) activities, distinct physiological patterns associated with these behavior modes are identified, providing a preliminary foundation for future adaptive HMC frameworks. This work offers a pathway for developing intelligent HMC systems that effectively integrate human intuition and machine intelligence in Industry 4.0.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a dual-loop human-machine collaboration task allocation model based on intuitive and intellectual human behavior modes, supported by experimental EEG and EMG data showing distinct physiological patterns for each mode. The model aims to improve human-machine interaction by integrating human intuition with machine intelligence in Industry 4.0 settings."

    "title": "HARP: Human-Assisted Regrouping with Permutation Invariant Critic for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2024-09-18",
    "abstract": "Human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning integrates human expertise to accelerate agent learning and provide critical guidance and feedback in complex fields. However, many existing approaches focus on single-agent tasks and require continuous human involvement during the training process, significantly increasing the human workload and limiting scalability. In this paper, we propose HARP (Human-Assisted Regrouping with Permutation Invariant Critic), a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework designed for group-oriented tasks. HARP integrates automatic agent regrouping with strategic human assistance during deployment, enabling and allowing non-experts to offer effective guidance with minimal intervention. During training, agents dynamically adjust their groupings to optimize collaborative task completion. When deployed, they actively seek human assistance and utilize the Permutation Invariant Group Critic to evaluate and refine human-proposed groupings, allowing non-expert users to contribute valuable suggestions. In multiple collaboration scenarios, our approach is able to leverage limited guidance from non-experts and enhance performance. The project can be found at https://github.com/huawen-hu/HARP.",
    "summary": "HARP is a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that uses human-assisted regrouping of agents to improve collaborative task performance, minimizing human workload by leveraging a permutation-invariant critic to evaluate and refine human suggestions. This allows non-expert users to provide effective guidance with minimal intervention."

    "title": "Applying HCAI in Developing Effective Human-AI Teaming: A Perspective from Human-AI Joint Cognitive Systems",
    "published_date": "2023-07-08",
    "abstract": "Research and application have used human-AI teaming (HAT) as a new paradigm to develop AI systems. HAT recognizes that AI will function as a teammate instead of simply a tool in collaboration with humans. Effective human-AI teams need to be capable of taking advantage of the unique abilities of both humans and AI while overcoming the known challenges and limitations of each member, augmenting human capabilities, and raising joint performance beyond that of either entity. The National AI Research and Strategic Plan 2023 update has recognized that research programs focusing primarily on the independent performance of AI systems generally fail to consider the functionality that AI must provide within the context of dynamic, adaptive, and collaborative teams and calls for further research on human-AI teaming and collaboration. However, there has been debate about whether AI can work as a teammate with humans. The primary concern is that adopting the\"teaming\"paradigm contradicts the human-centered AI (HCAI) approach, resulting in humans losing control of AI systems. This article further analyzes the HAT paradigm and the debates. Specifically, we elaborate on our proposed conceptual framework of human-AI joint cognitive systems (HAIJCS) and apply it to represent HAT under the HCAI umbrella. We believe that HAIJCS may help adopt HAI while enabling HCAI. The implications and future work for HAIJCS are also discussed. Insights: AI has led to the emergence of a new form of human-machine relationship: human-AI teaming (HAT), a paradigmatic shift in human-AI systems; We must follow a human-centered AI (HCAI) approach when applying HAT as a new design paradigm; We propose a conceptual framework of human-AI joint cognitive systems (HAIJCS) to represent and implement HAT for developing effective human-AI teaming",

    "summary": "This paper argues that the human-AI teaming (HAT) paradigm, while promising for enhanced performance, must adhere to a human-centered AI (HCAI) approach to avoid human control loss. The authors propose a human-AI joint cognitive systems (HAIJCS) framework to reconcile HAT with HCAI principles and facilitate effective human-AI collaboration."

    "title": "Human-AI Collaboration: The Effect of AI Delegation on Human Task Performance and Task Satisfaction",
    "published_date": "2023-03-16",
    "abstract": "Recent work has proposed artificial intelligence (AI) models that can learn to decide whether to make a prediction for an instance of a task or to delegate it to a human by considering both parties' capabilities. In simulations with synthetically generated or context-independent human predictions, delegation can help improve the performance of human-AI teams—compared to humans or the AI model completing the task alone. However, so far, it remains unclear how humans perform and how they perceive the task when they are aware that an AI model delegated task instances to them. In an experimental study with 196 participants, we show that task performance and task satisfaction improve through AI delegation, regardless of whether humans are aware of the delegation. Additionally, we identify humans' increased levels of self-efficacy as the underlying mechanism for these improvements in performance and satisfaction. Our findings provide initial evidence that allowing AI models to take over more management responsibilities can be an effective form of human-AI collaboration in workplaces.",
    "citation_count": 26,
    "summary": "An experimental study demonstrates that AI delegation of tasks to humans improves both task performance and satisfaction, driven by increased human self-efficacy, regardless of whether humans are aware of the delegation process. This suggests that AI-managed task allocation can be a beneficial approach to human-AI collaboration."

    "title": "Initial Task Allocation for Multi-Human Multi-Robot Teams with Attention-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2023-03-04",
    "abstract": "Multi-human multi-robot teams have great potential for complex and large-scale tasks through the collaboration of humans and robots with diverse capabilities and expertise. To efficiently operate such highly heterogeneous teams and maximize team performance timely, sophisticated initial task allocation strategies that consider individual differences across team members and tasks are required. While existing works have shown promising results in reallocating tasks based on agent state and performance, the neglect of the inherent heterogeneity of the team hinders their effectiveness in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of the initial task allocation problem in multi-human multi-robot teams as a contextual multi-attribute decision-make process and propose an attention-based deep reinforcement learning approach. We introduce a cross-attribute attention module to encode the latent and complex dependencies of multiple attributes in the state representation. We conduct a case study in a massive threat surveillance scenario and demonstrate the strengths of our model.",

    "title": "A Unified Architecture for Dynamic Role Allocation and Collaborative Task Planning in Mixed Human-Robot Teams",
    "published_date": "2023-01-19",
    "abstract": "The growing deployment of human-robot collaborative processes in several industrial applications, such as handling, welding, and assembly, unfolds the pursuit of systems which are able to manage large heterogeneous teams and, at the same time, monitor the execution of complex tasks. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for dynamic role allocation and collaborative task planning in a mixed human-robot team of arbitrary size. The architecture capitalizes on a centralized reactive and modular task-agnostic planning method based on Behavior Trees (BTs), in charge of actions scheduling, while the allocation problem is formulated through a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), that assigns dynamically individual roles or collaborations to the agents of the team. Different metrics used as MILP cost allow the architecture to favor various aspects of the collaboration (e.g. makespan, ergonomics, human preferences). Human preference are identified through a negotiation phase, in which, an human agent can accept/refuse to execute the assigned task.In addition, bilateral communication between humans and the system is achieved through an Augmented Reality (AR) custom user interface that provides intuitive functionalities to assist and coordinate workers in different action phases. The computational complexity of the proposed methodology outperforms literature approaches in industrial sized jobs and teams (problems up to 50 actions and 20 agents in the team with collaborations are solved within 1 s). The different allocated roles, as the cost functions change, highlights the flexibility of the architecture to several production requirements. Finally, the subjective evaluation demonstrating the high usability level and the suitability for the targeted scenario.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a novel architecture for dynamic role allocation and collaborative task planning in mixed human-robot teams using a centralized Behavior Tree-based planner and a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) for role assignment, optimizing for various metrics including human preferences communicated via an Augmented Reality interface. The architecture efficiently handles large teams and complex tasks, outperforming existing methods in computational speed."
