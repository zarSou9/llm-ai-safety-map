    "abstract": "The complexity and increasingly tight coupling of supply chains poses a major logistical challenge for leading companies. Another challenge is that leading companies -- under pressure from consumers, a critical public and legislative measures such as supply chain laws -- have to take more responsibility than before for their suppliers' labour standards. In this paper, we discuss a new approach that leading companies are using to try to address these challenges: algorithmic prediction of business risks, but also environmental and social risks. We describe the technical and cultural conditions for algorithmic prediction and explain how -- from the perspective of leading companies -- it helps to address both challenges. We then develop scenarios on how and with what kind of social consequences algorithmic prediction can be used by leading companies. From the scenarios, we derive policy options for different stakeholder groups to help develop algorithmic prediction towards improving labour standards and worker voice. -- Die Komplexit\\\"at und zunehmend enge Kopplung vieler Lieferketten stellt eine gro{\\ss}e logistische Herausforderung f\\\"ur Leitunternehmen dar. Eine weitere Herausforderung besteht darin, dass Leitunternehmen -- gedr\\\"angt durch Konsument:innen, eine kritische \\\"Offentlichkeit und gesetzgeberische Ma{\\ss}nahmen wie die Lieferkettengesetze -- st\\\"arker als bisher Verantwortung f\\\"ur Arbeitsstandards in ihren Zulieferbetrieben \\\"ubernehmen m\\\"ussen. In diesem Beitrag diskutieren wir einen neuen Ansatz, mit dem Leitunternehmen versuchen, diese Herausforderungen zu bearbeiten: die algorithmische Vorhersage von betriebswirtschaftlichen, aber auch \\\"okologischen und sozialen Risiken. Wir beschreiben die technischen und kulturellen Bedingungen f\\\"ur algorithmische Vorhersage und erkl\\\"aren, wie diese -- aus Perspektive von Leitunternehmen -- bei der Bearbeitung beider Herausforderungen hilft. Anschlie{\\ss}end entwickeln wir Szenarien, wie und mit welchen sozialen Konsequenzen algorithmische Vorhersage durch Leitunternehmen eingesetzt werden kann. Aus den Szenarien leiten wir Handlungsoptionen f\\\"ur verschiedene Stakeholder-Gruppen ab, die dabei helfen sollen, algorithmische Vorhersage im Sinne einer Verbesserung von Arbeitsstandards und Workers' Voice weiterzuentwickeln.",
    "summary": "This paper examines how leading companies utilize algorithmic prediction to manage complex supply chains and improve labor standards, analyzing the technical and cultural conditions enabling this approach and exploring potential social consequences and policy implications for various stakeholders. The authors develop scenarios to illustrate how algorithmic prediction might impact worker rights and voice."

    "title": "Algorithmic Collective Action in Machine Learning",
    "published_date": "2023-02-08",
    "abstract": "We initiate a principled study of algorithmic collective action on digital platforms that deploy machine learning algorithms. We propose a simple theoretical model of a collective interacting with a firm's learning algorithm. The collective pools the data of participating individuals and executes an algorithmic strategy by instructing participants how to modify their own data to achieve a collective goal. We investigate the consequences of this model in three fundamental learning-theoretic settings: the case of a nonparametric optimal learning algorithm, a parametric risk minimizer, and gradient-based optimization. In each setting, we come up with coordinated algorithmic strategies and characterize natural success criteria as a function of the collective's size. Complementing our theory, we conduct systematic experiments on a skill classification task involving tens of thousands of resumes from a gig platform for freelancers. Through more than two thousand model training runs of a BERT-like language model, we see a striking correspondence emerge between our empirical observations and the predictions made by our theory. Taken together, our theory and experiments broadly support the conclusion that algorithmic collectives of exceedingly small fractional size can exert significant control over a platform's learning algorithm.",

    "summary": "This paper models algorithmic collective action where individuals strategically modify their data to influence a platform's machine learning algorithm, demonstrating theoretically and empirically that even small collectives can significantly impact algorithm outcomes. The research analyzes this interaction across various learning settings and validates findings with experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset."

    "published_date": "2023-12-09",
    "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape the knowledge economy by enabling problem solving at scale. This paper introduces a framework to analyze this transformation, incorporating AI into an economy where humans form hierarchical firms to use their time efficiently: Less knowledgeable individuals become\"workers\"solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable individuals become\"solvers\"assisting workers with exceptional problems. We model AI as a technology that transforms computing power into\"AI agents,\"which can either operate autonomously (as co-workers or solvers/co-pilots) or non-autonomously (only as co-pilots). We show that basic autonomous AI displaces humans towards specialized problem solving, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced autonomous AI reallocates humans to routine work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. While autonomous AI primarily benefits the most knowledgeable individuals, non-autonomous AI disproportionately benefits the least knowledgeable. However, autonomous AI achieves higher overall output. These findings reconcile seemingly contradictory empirical evidence and reveal key tradeoffs involved in regulating AI autonomy.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on hierarchical firms within a knowledge economy, showing that basic autonomous AI leads to smaller, less productive firms while advanced autonomous AI creates larger, more productive ones, with differing distributional effects depending on AI autonomy levels. The model reveals trade-offs in regulating AI autonomy and reconciles contradictory empirical evidence."

    "title": "Street-Level Algorithms and AI in Bureaucratic Decision-Making",
    "abstract": "Studies of algorithmic decision-making in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and related fields of research increasingly recognize an analogy between AI and bureaucracies. We elaborate this link with an empirical study of AI in the context of decision-making in a street-level bureaucracy: job placement. The study examines caseworkers' perspectives on the use of AI, and contributes to an understanding of bureaucratic decision-making, with implications for integrating AI in caseworker systems. We report findings from a participatory workshop on AI with 35 caseworkers from different types of public services, followed up by interviews with five caseworkers specializing in job placement. The paper contributes an understanding of caseworkers' collaboration around documentation as a key aspect of bureaucratic decision-making practices. The collaborative aspects of casework are important to show because they are subject to process descriptions making case documentation prone for an individually focused AI with consequences for the future of how casework develops as a practice. Examining the collaborative aspects of caseworkers' documentation practices in the context of AI and (potentially) automation, our data show that caseworkers perceive AI as valuable when it can support their work towards management, (strengthen their cause, if a case requires extra resources), and towards unemployed individuals (strengthen their cause in relation to the individual's case when deciding on, and assigning a specific job placement program). We end by discussing steps to support cooperative aspects in AI decision-support systems that are increasingly implemented into the bureaucratic context of public services.",

    "title": "Participatory Algorithmic Management: Elicitation Methods for Worker Well-Being Models",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to manage the workforce. Algorithmic management promises organizational efficiency, but often undermines worker well-being. How can we computationally model worker well-being so that algorithmic management can be optimized for and assessed in terms of worker well-being? Toward this goal, we propose a participatory approach for worker well-being models. We first define worker well-being models: Work preference models---preferences about work and working conditions, and managerial fairness models---beliefs about fair resource allocation among multiple workers. We then propose elicitation methods to enable workers to build their own well-being models leveraging pairwise comparisons and ranking. As a case study, we evaluate our methods in the context of algorithmic work scheduling with 25 shift workers and 3 managers. The findings show that workers expressed idiosyncratic work preference models and more uniform managerial fairness models, and the elicitation methods helped workers discover their preferences and gave them a sense of empowerment. Our work provides a method and initial evidence for enabling participatory algorithmic management for worker well-being.",
