### Mini Description

Study of how AI-driven management tools change workplace supervision, task allocation, and performance evaluation methods

### Description

Algorithmic Management Systems research examines how AI-driven tools and platforms are transforming workplace supervision, coordination, and decision-making processes. This includes studying how algorithms monitor worker performance, allocate tasks, make scheduling decisions, and implement organizational policies. The field analyzes both the technical architectures of these systems and their impacts on worker autonomy, job quality, and organizational effectiveness.

A central focus is understanding how algorithmic management affects workplace power dynamics, accountability, and worker agency. Researchers investigate how these systems influence worker behavior through automated incentives, performance metrics, and decision-making processes that may lack transparency or appeal mechanisms. This includes examining how algorithmic management systems collect and utilize worker data, balance optimization objectives, and handle edge cases or unexpected situations.

The field also explores the psychological and social implications of algorithmic management, including worker stress, motivation, and professional development under automated supervision. Researchers study how these systems affect worker-manager relationships, team dynamics, and organizational culture, while developing frameworks for evaluating system fairness, effectiveness, and potential negative externalities. Particular attention is paid to identifying best practices for system design that balance operational efficiency with worker well-being and rights.
