### Mini Description

Investigation of how AI adoption leads to changes in corporate hierarchies, decision-making processes, and internal labor markets

### Description

Organizational Structure Changes research examines how AI adoption drives fundamental shifts in corporate hierarchies, decision-making processes, and organizational design. This includes studying how AI capabilities enable new forms of organizational coordination, alter power dynamics between different organizational levels, and influence the distribution of authority and responsibility within firms. Researchers analyze both direct structural changes, such as the flattening of hierarchies through automated middle management functions, and indirect effects like the emergence of new specialized units and roles focused on AI governance and integration.

A key focus is understanding how AI transforms traditional organizational boundaries and departmental divisions. This involves examining how AI systems enable more fluid, network-based structures that can dynamically reconfigure based on changing needs and opportunities. Researchers investigate how these changes affect information flows, knowledge management, and coordination mechanisms within organizations, including the evolution of cross-functional teams and matrix structures in response to AI integration.

The field also explores how AI adoption influences organizational decision rights, governance mechanisms, and control systems. This includes studying how organizations balance centralized AI-driven decision-making with local autonomy, how they adapt their strategic planning processes to incorporate AI capabilities, and how they restructure to manage the increasing complexity of human-AI interactions. Particular attention is paid to understanding how these structural changes affect organizational agility, innovation capacity, and ability to adapt to rapidly evolving technological landscapes.
