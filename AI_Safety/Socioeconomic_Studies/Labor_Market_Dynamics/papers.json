    "title": "GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models",
    "published_date": "2023-03-17",
    "abstract": "We investigate the potential implications of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), on the U.S. labor market, focusing on the increased capabilities arising from LLM-powered software compared to LLMs on their own. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56% of all tasks. This finding implies that LLM-powered software will have a substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs could significantly impact the U.S. labor market, with an estimated 80% of workers potentially seeing at least 10% of their tasks affected and 19% facing at least 50% impact, particularly impacting higher-income jobs and exceeding effects seen in only high-productivity growth industries. LLM-powered software further amplifies this impact, potentially automating 47-56% of all worker tasks."

    "published_date": "2020-01-28",
    "abstract": "The recent wave of AI and automation has been argued to differ from previous General Purpose Technologies (GPTs), in that it may lead to rapid change in occupations' underlying task requirements and persistent technological unemployment. In this paper, we apply a novel methodology of dynamic task shares to a large dataset of online job postings to explore how exactly occupational task demands have changed over the past decade of AI innovation, especially across high, mid and low wage occupations. Notably, big data and AI have risen significantly among high wage occupations since 2012 and 2016, respectively. We built an ARIMA model to predict future occupational task demands and showcase several relevant examples in Healthcare, Administration, and IT. Such task demands predictions across occupations will play a pivotal role in retraining the workforce of the future.",

    "published_date": "2023-08-04",
    "abstract": "Is artificial intelligence (AI) disrupting jobs and creating unemployment? Despite many attempts to quantify occupations' exposure to AI, inconsistent validation obfuscates the relative benefits of each approach. A lack of disaggregated labor outcome data, including unemployment data, further exacerbates the issue. Here, we assess which models of AI exposure predict job separations and unemployment risk using new occupation-level unemployment data by occupation from each US state's unemployment insurance office spanning 2010 through 2020. Although these AI exposure scores have been used by governments and industry, we find that individual AI exposure models are not predictive of unemployment rates, unemployment risk, or job separation rates. However, an ensemble of those models exhibits substantial predictive power suggesting that competing models may capture different aspects of AI exposure that collectively account for AI's variable impact across occupations, regions, and time. Our results also call for dynamic, context-aware, and validated methods for assessing AI exposure. Interactive visualizations for this study are available at https://sites.pitt.edu/~mrfrank/uiRiskDemo/.",

    "title": "Toward understanding the impact of artificial intelligence on labor",
    "abstract": "Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies have the potential to significantly disrupt labor markets. While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human–machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress. Finally, given the fundamental uncertainty in predicting technological change, we recommend developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.",

    "title": "Automation and New Tasks: How Technology Displaces and Reinstates Labor",
    "abstract": "We present a framework for understanding the effects of automation and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use it to interpret changes in US employment over the recent past. At the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital and labor—the task content of production. Automation, which enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor because of a displacement effect. As a result, automation always reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task content of production in favor of labor because of a reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of production—due to automation and new tasks—can be inferred from industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last three decades is accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the evolution of occupations within the context of industry and technology life cycles, highlighting the critical yet underexplored intersection between occupational trends and broader economic dynamics. Introducing the Occupation Life Cycle (OLC) model, we delineate five stages (i.e., growth, peak, fluctuation, maturity, and decline) to systematically explore the trajectory of occupations. Utilizing job posting data from one of China's largest recruitment platforms as a novel proxy, our study meticulously tracks the fluctuations and emerging trends in the labor market from 2018 to 2023. Through a detailed examination of representative roles, such as short video operators and data analysts, alongside emerging occupations within the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, our findings allocate occupations to specific life cycle stages, revealing insightful patterns of occupational development and decline. Our findings offer a unique perspective on the interplay between occupational evolution and economic factors, with a particular focus on the rapidly changing Chinese labor market. This study not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of OLC but also provides practical insights for policymakers, educators, and industry leaders facing the challenges of workforce planning and development in the face of technological advancement and market shifts.",

    "title": "Convergence-aware Clustered Federated Graph Learning Framework for Collaborative Inter-company Labor Market Forecasting",
    "published_date": "2024-09-29",
    "abstract": "Labor market forecasting on talent demand and supply is essential for business management and economic development. With accurate and timely forecasts, employers can adapt their recruitment strategies to align with the evolving labor market, and employees can have proactive career path planning according to future demand and supply. However, previous studies ignore the interconnection between demand-supply sequences among different companies and positions for predicting variations. Moreover, companies are reluctant to share their private human resource data for global labor market analysis due to concerns over jeopardizing competitive advantage, security threats, and potential ethical or legal violations. To this end, in this paper, we formulate the Federated Labor Market Forecasting (FedLMF) problem and propose a Meta-personalized Convergence-aware Clustered Federated Learning (MPCAC-FL) framework to provide accurate and timely collaborative talent demand and supply prediction in a privacy-preserving way. First, we design a graph-based sequential model to capture the inherent correlation between demand and supply sequences and company-position pairs. Second, we adopt meta-learning techniques to learn effective initial model parameters that can be shared across companies, allowing personalized models to be optimized for forecasting company-specific demand and supply, even when companies have heterogeneous data. Third, we devise a Convergence-aware Clustering algorithm to dynamically divide companies into groups according to model similarity and apply federated aggregation in each group. The heterogeneity can be alleviated for more stable convergence and better performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPCAC-FL outperforms compared baselines on three real-world datasets and achieves over 97% of the state-of-the-art model, i.e., DH-GEM, without exposing private company data.",
    "summary": "The paper proposes MPCAC-FL, a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for collaborative labor market forecasting, using a graph-based sequential model and meta-learning to improve accuracy and convergence by clustering companies with similar data. This approach allows companies to collaboratively predict talent demand and supply without sharing sensitive HR data."

    "abstract": "Vafa et al. (2024) introduced a transformer-based econometric model, CAREER, that predicts a worker's next job as a function of career history (an\"occupation model\"). CAREER was initially estimated (\"pre-trained\") using a large, unrepresentative resume dataset, which served as a\"foundation model,\"and parameter estimation was continued (\"fine-tuned\") using data from a representative survey. CAREER had better predictive performance than benchmarks. This paper considers an alternative where the resume-based foundation model is replaced by a large language model (LLM). We convert tabular data from the survey into text files that resemble resumes and fine-tune the LLMs using these text files with the objective to predict the next token (word). The resulting fine-tuned LLM is used as an input to an occupation model. Its predictive performance surpasses all prior models. We demonstrate the value of fine-tuning and further show that by adding more career data from a different population, fine-tuning smaller LLMs surpasses the performance of fine-tuning larger models.",

    "published_date": "2023-02-20",
    "abstract": "The impact of aggressive capitalist approaches on social, economic and planet sustainability is significant. Economic issues such as inflation, energy costs, taxes and interest rates persist and are further exacerbated by global events such as wars, pandemics and environmental disasters. A sustained history of financial crises exposes weaknesses in modern economies. The Great Attrition, with many quitting jobs, adds to concerns. The diversity of the workforce poses new challenges. Transformative approaches are essential to safeguard societies, economies and the planet. In this work, we use big data and machine learning methods to discover multi-perspective parameters for multi-generational labour markets. The parameters for the academic perspective are discovered using 35,000 article abstracts from the Web of Science for the period 1958–2022 and for the professionals' perspective using 57,000 LinkedIn posts from 2022. We discover a total of 28 parameters and categorized them into five macro-parameters, Learning & Skills, Employment Sectors, Consumer Industries, Learning & Employment Issues and Generations-specific Issues. A complete machine learning software tool is developed for data-driven parameter discovery. A variety of quantitative and visualization methods are applied and multiple taxonomies are extracted to explore multi-generational labour markets. A knowledge structure and literature review of multi-generational labour markets using over 100 research articles is provided. It is expected that this work will enhance the theory and practice of artificial intelligence-based methods for knowledge discovery and system parameter discovery to develop autonomous capabilities and systems and promote novel approaches to labour economics and markets, leading to the development of sustainable societies and economies.",

    "published_date": "2023-01-19",
    "abstract": "In the last decade, the study of labour dynamics has led to the introduction of labour flow networks (LFNs) as a way to conceptualise job-to-job transitions, and to the development of mathematical models to explore the dynamics of these networked flows. To date, LFN models have relied upon an assumption of static network structure. However, as recent events (increasing automation in the workplace, the COVID-19 pandemic, a surge in the demand for programming skills, etc.) have shown, we are experiencing drastic shifts to the job landscape that are altering the ways individuals navigate the labour market. Here we develop a novel model that emerges LFNs from agent-level behaviour, removing the necessity of assuming that future job-to-job flows will be along the same paths where they have been historically observed. This model, informed by microdata for the United Kingdom, generates empirical LFNs with a high level of accuracy. We use the model to explore how shocks impacting the underlying distributions of jobs and wages alter the topology of the LFN. This framework represents a crucial step towards the development of models that can answer questions about the future of work in an ever-changing world.",

    "abstract": "Emerging professions in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sustainability (green jobs) are experiencing labour shortages as industry demand outpaces labour supply. In this context, our study aims to understand whether employers have begun focusing more on individual skills rather than formal qualifications in their recruitment processes. We analysed a large time-series dataset of approximately eleven million online job vacancies in the UK from 2018 to mid-2024, drawing on diverse literature on technological change and labour market signalling. Our findings provide evidence that employers have initiated\"skill-based hiring\"for AI roles, adopting more flexible hiring practices to expand the available talent pool. From 2018-2023, demand for AI roles grew by 21% as a proportion of all postings (and accelerated into 2024). Simultaneously, mentions of university education requirements for AI roles declined by 15%. Our regression analysis shows that university degrees have a significantly lower wage premium for both AI and green roles. In contrast, AI skills command a wage premium of 23%, exceeding the value of degrees up until the PhD-level (33%). In occupations with high demand for AI skills, the premium for skills is high, and the reward for degrees is relatively low. We recommend leveraging alternative skill-building formats such as apprenticeships, on-the-job training, MOOCs, vocational education and training, micro-certificates, and online bootcamps to fully utilise human capital and address talent shortages.",

    "abstract": "Exciting advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked concern for jobs, education, productivity, and the future of work. As with past technologies, generative AI may not lead to mass unemployment. But, unlike past technologies, generative AI is creative, cognitive, and potentially ubiquitous which makes the usual assumptions of automation predictions ill-suited for today. Existing projections suggest that generative AI will impact workers in occupations that were previously considered immune to automation. As AI's full set of capabilities and applications emerge, policy makers should promote workers' career adaptability. This goal requires improved data on job separations and unemployment by locality and job titles in order to identify early-indicators for the workers facing labor disruption. Further, prudent policy should incentivize education programs to accommodate learning with AI as a tool while preparing students for the demands of the future of work.",
