### Mini Description

Development of frameworks and metrics for assessing how existing skills can be applied to new roles, including identification of skill adjacencies and gaps

### Description

Skill Transferability Mapping focuses on developing systematic approaches to understand and quantify how skills from one occupation can be effectively applied to different roles, particularly in the context of AI-driven labor market transitions. This research area combines computational methods, labor market data analysis, and cognitive science to create frameworks that can identify overlapping skill sets, measure skill similarity, and predict the learning curve required for skill adaptation. Key challenges include developing precise taxonomies of skills, accounting for both technical and soft skills, and understanding how skills combine and interact in different occupational contexts.

Researchers in this field employ various methodologies, from traditional statistical analysis of job descriptions and employment data to more advanced techniques using natural language processing and network analysis. These approaches help create skill distance metrics, identify skill clusters, and map potential transition pathways between occupations. A critical aspect involves understanding how skills evolve and transform as they transfer between contexts, including how general capabilities (like critical thinking or problem-solving) manifest differently across various roles.

Current research frontiers include developing more sophisticated models for understanding skill complementarity and substitutability, improving methods for measuring skill acquisition difficulty, and creating dynamic frameworks that can adapt to rapidly evolving skill requirements in an AI-transformed economy. There is particular interest in understanding how AI itself might alter the nature of skill transferability, both by changing the underlying skill requirements of jobs and by potentially making certain skills more or less adaptable across contexts.
