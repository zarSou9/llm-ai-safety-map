    "title": "Applying the Loss/Momentum Framework to Identify Systemic Barriers for Community College Transfer Students",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Although 80% of entering community college students express a desire to earn a bachelor's degree, only about 30% transfer to a four-year institution and even fewer complete a bachelor's degree within six years. The Loss/Momentum Framework (LMF) is a tool for identifying interactions between an institution and its students that can either propel (momentum points) or impede (loss points) progress toward degree completion. This study utilized the LMF to understand the loss and momentum points commonly encountered by students at various phases of their vertical transfer journeys. Using a qualitative research design, we conducted focus groups and interviews with 33 pre- and post-transfer students from a sending community college and a receiving four-year university in Ohio. Sources of momentum included positive interactions with institutional agents (especially advisors and faculty members), institutional programs and processes that conveyed a transfer receptive culture, and easy-to-navigate transfer processes. In contrast, loss points included inaccessible or unhelpful advising as well as opaque and poorly communicated practices and policies regarding degree requirements, credit transfer, and financial aid. Our findings underscore the need for sending and receiving institutions to ensure advising practices, credit transfer policies, and financial aid processes are accessible and transparent to remove barriers and boost momentum. We also encourage institutions to invest in opportunities for transfer students to build relationships with institutional agents, which are particularly important for supporting minoritized students, and with peers.",

    "summary": "This study used the Loss/Momentum Framework to identify systemic barriers and facilitators to community college student transfer, finding that positive advisor interactions and clear transfer processes fostered momentum, while poor advising, opaque policies, and financial aid issues created significant obstacles. The findings highlight the need for improved transparency and support systems to increase transfer success rates."

    "title": "Chutes and Ladders",
    "abstract": "Community colleges play a large role in educating students who are historically underrepresented in computer science (CS), including women, Latino men, and Black men, as well as post-traditional (older or working) students. In spite of this, there is a dearth of research on the institutional factors that influence whether or not community college students who are enrolled in CS classes and who express an interest in transferring and completing a bachelor's degree in the field persist. The overused “pipeline” metaphor, which indicates a supply-side lack, has been replaced by many with that of a “pathway.” However, the “pathway” image suggests a general forward-moving trend that can be misleading. In this work, we draw from qualitative interviews with 14 CS students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the field who have studied introductory computer programming at a community college to investigate the following question: “What are the institutional barriers along a CS bachelor's degree track that includes community college?” Our findings indicate that there are three categories of institutional barriers along the transfer pathway: setbacks that hinder student progression forward, discontinuities in which students leave and re-enter the pathway, and departures in which students leave computer science and/or leave college altogether. We describe specific examples of each and introduce the idea of student movement as a game of “chutes and ladders,” a convoluted trail where students can slide backwards or off the path (chutes), necessitating the implementation of targeted institutional supports that can boost student progress forward (ladders). We suggest institutional interventions that can help students facing each type of barrier to continue on course through community college and transfer to a four-year university.",

    "title": "Breaking barriers: The effect of protected characteristics and their intersectionality on career transition in academics",
    "abstract": "In the past decade the scientific community has been trying to tackle the historical underrepresentation of women in science and the fact that gender can constitute a barrier to career success. However, other characteristics, such as being of an ethnic minority or coming from an under-privileged background, have received less attention. In this study we find that ethnicity and socioeconomic status impact detrimentally on career progression in early career scientists, despite the fact that gender is more likely to be reported as a barrier. Our data suggest we need to widen the discussion regarding diversity and equality in science to incorporate potential barriers to career success in addition to gender. Abstract The academic disciplines of Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) have long suffered from a lack of diversity. While in recent years there has been some progress in addressing the underrepresentation of women in STEM subjects, other protected characteristics have received less attention. In this study, we survey early career scientists in the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, behaviour, and related disciplines. We (i) quantitatively examine the effect of protected characteristics and their intersectionality on career transition, and (ii) provide practical suggestions, based on the qualitative responses of those surveyed, for overcoming some of the barriers we identified. We found that socioeconomic background and ethnicity impacted negatively on the quantitative measures of career progression we examined. Respondents that were female, LGBT, and from a lower socioeconomic background were more likely to report having faced a barrier, and the most frequent barrier named was related to gender. Our results suggest that respondents may have felt more confident discussing the experiences they have had related to their gender, potentially because there is now widespread discourse on this subject. However, respondents were less likely to discuss barriers they have faced in relation to ethnicity and socioeconomic status, despite the fact that the data indicates these are more detrimental to career progression. This may reflect the fact that these characteristics have received less attention, and are therefore deemed more sensitive. We hope that this study will stimulate wider discussion, and help to inform strategies to address the underrepresentation of minority groups in STEM subjects.",
