    "title": "Improving the stability of temporal statistics in transition path theory with sparse data.",
    "published_date": "2023-01-30",
    "abstract": "Ulam's method is a popular discretization scheme for stochastic operators that involves the construction of a transition probability matrix controlling a Markov chain on a set of cells covering some domain. We consider an application to satellite-tracked undrogued surface-ocean drifting buoy trajectories obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Drifter Program dataset. Motivated by the motion of Sargassum in the tropical Atlantic, we apply Transition Path Theory (TPT) to drifters originating off the west coast of Africa to the Gulf of Mexico. We find that the most common case of a regular covering by equal longitude-latitude side cells can lead to a large instability in the computed transition times as a function of the number of cells used. We propose a different covering based on a clustering of the trajectory data that is stable against the number of cells in the covering. We also propose a generalization of the standard transition time statistic of TPT that can be used to construct a partition of the domain of interest into weakly dynamically connected regions.",

    "published_date": "2023-09-19",
    "abstract": "In this work, we seek to simulate rare transitions between metastable states using score-based generative models. An efficient method for generating high-quality transition paths is valuable for the study of molecular systems since data is often difficult to obtain. We develop two novel methods for path generation in this paper: a chain-based approach and a midpoint-based approach. The first biases the original dynamics to facilitate transitions, while the second mirrors splitting techniques and breaks down the original transition into smaller transitions. Numerical results of generated transition paths for the M\\\"uller potential and for Alanine dipeptide demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches in both the data-rich and data-scarce regimes.",

    "title": "Exploring the use of Transition Path Theory in building an oil spill prediction scheme",
    "published_date": "2022-09-13",
    "abstract": "The Transition Path Theory (TPT) of complex systems has proven to be a robust means to statistically characterize the ensemble of trajectories that connect any two preset flow regions, say ùíú and ‚Ñ¨, directly. More specifically, transition paths are such that they start in ùíú and then go to ‚Ñ¨ without detouring back to ùíú or ‚Ñ¨. This way, they make an effective contribution to the transport from ùíú to ‚Ñ¨. Here, we explore its use for building a scheme that enables predicting the evolution of an oil spill in the ocean. This involves appropriately adapting TPT such that it includes a reservoir that pumps oil into a typically open domain. Additionally, we lift up the restriction of the oil not to return to the spill site en route to a region that is targeted to be protected. TPT is applied on oil trajectories available up to the present, e.g., as integrated using velocities produced by a data assimilative system or as inferred from high-frequency radars, to make a prediction of transition oil paths beyond, without relying on forecasted oil trajectories. As a proof of concept, we consider a hypothetical oil spill in the Trion oil field, under development within the Perdido Foldbelt in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This is done using trajectories integrated from climatological and hindcast surface velocity and winds as well as produced by satellite-tracked surface drifting buoys, in each case discretized into a Markov chain that provides a framework for the TPT-based prediction.",
    "citation_count": 3,
    "summary": "This paper proposes using Transition Path Theory (TPT) to predict oil spill trajectories, adapting the method to account for continuous oil release and potential returns to the spill site. The authors demonstrate the approach using hypothetical and real-world oil spill scenarios, leveraging existing trajectory data to predict future oil movement without relying on forecast trajectories."

    "title": "The Fate of the American Dream: A First Passage Under Resetting Approach to Income Dynamics",
    "published_date": "2022-12-26",
    "abstract": "Detailed knowledge of individual income dynamics is crucial for investigating the existence of the American dream: Are we able to improve our income status during our working life? This key question simply boils down to observing individual status and how it moves between two thresholds: the current income and the desired income. Yet, our knowledge of these temporal properties of income remains limited since we rely on estimates coming from transition matrices which simplify income dynamics by aggregating the individual changes into quantiles and thus overlooking significant microscopic variations. Here, we bridge this gap by employing First Passage Time concepts in a baseline stochastic process with resetting used for modeling income dynamics and developing a framework that is able to crucially disaggregate the temporal properties of income to the level of an individual worker. We find analytically and illustrate numerically that our framework is orthogonal to the transition matrix approach and leads to improved and more granular estimates. Moreover, to facilitate empirical applications of the framework, we introduce a publicly available statistical methodology, and showcase the application using the USA income dynamics data. These results help to improve our understanding on the temporal properties of income in real economies and provide a set of tools for designing policy interventions.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel first-passage time framework with resetting to analyze individual income dynamics, offering a more granular and accurate alternative to traditional transition matrix methods by disaggregating income changes at the individual level. The resulting methodology, implemented using US income data and made publicly available, provides improved estimates of income mobility and informs policy design."

    "abstract": "We propose a general methodology to measure labour market dynamics, inspired by the search and matching framework, based on the estimate of the transition rates between labour market states. We show how to estimate instantaneous transition rates starting from discrete time observations provided in longitudinal datasets, allowing for any number of states. We illustrate the potential of such methodology using Italian labour market data. First, we decompose the unemployment rate fluctuations into inflow and outflow driven components; then, we evaluate the impact of the implementation of a labour market reform, which substantially changed the regulations of temporary contracts.",

    "published_date": "2020-11-07",
    "abstract": "The structures, including technologies, industries, infrastructure and institutions, in a country have three attributes, namely, structurality, durationality, and transformality. The paper proposes a novel method to model the structural transformation in a market economy. With the common knowledge assumption, the paper proposes a generic model combining optimal control and optimal switching to study the static equilibrium and dynamic equilibrium of resource allocations under a given industrial structure and the equilibrium when the condition for transforming industrial structures arises by a social planner to maximize the representative household's utility in a market economy. The paper establishes the mathematical underpinning of the static equilibrium, dynamic equilibrium and structural equilibrium. The generic model and its equilibria are then extended to economies with complicated economic structures consisting of hierarchical production, composite consumption, technology adoption and innovation, infrastructure, and economic and political institutions. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of applications of the proposed methodology to economic development problems in other scenarios.",
    "summary": "This paper develops a novel model of endogenous structural transformation in market economies, using optimal control and optimal switching to analyze resource allocation and industrial structure changes that maximize household utility. The model accounts for various complexities including hierarchical production, technology adoption, and institutional factors."
