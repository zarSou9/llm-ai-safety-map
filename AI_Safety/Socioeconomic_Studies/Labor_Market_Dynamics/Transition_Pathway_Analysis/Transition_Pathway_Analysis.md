### Mini Description

Research on career transition opportunities and barriers for displaced workers, including evaluation of retraining programs and support mechanisms

### Description

Transition Pathway Analysis investigates how workers displaced by AI automation can effectively transition to new roles or careers, examining both individual-level factors and systemic support mechanisms. This research area combines insights from labor economics, education theory, and career development to understand barriers to successful transitions and identify effective interventions. Key focus areas include analyzing skill transferability between occupations, evaluating the effectiveness of different retraining approaches, and studying the role of support systems in facilitating successful career changes.

Researchers in this field develop frameworks for mapping viable transition pathways, considering factors such as skill adjacency, training duration, wage differentials, and geographic mobility constraints. This includes creating detailed occupational transition maps that identify promising destination roles based on overlapping skill sets and reasonable retraining requirements. The field also examines how different demographic factors, existing skill levels, and local economic conditions affect transition success rates.

A critical aspect of this research involves evaluating the effectiveness of various support mechanisms, from traditional education and training programs to newer approaches like micro-credentials and adaptive learning systems. This includes studying the role of career counseling, financial support during transitions, and employer-based reskilling programs. Researchers also investigate how policy interventions, such as unemployment benefits or training subsidies, influence transition outcomes and what institutional structures best facilitate successful career changes in an AI-transformed economy.
