    "title": "The Intelligence Curse",
    "published_date": "2025-01-03",
    "summary": "The author introduces the \"intelligence curse,\" arguing that the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will create rentier-like incentives for powerful actors, leading them to prioritize AGI's output over human well-being and resulting in decreased investment in human capital and societal support. This is analogous to the \"resource curse\" where reliance on resource extraction hinders societal development."

    "title": "Building AI Research Fleets",
    "published_date": "2025-01-12",
    "summary": "Research automation will not simply replace individual researchers with AI \"scientists,\" but rather create \"AI research fleets\"—teams of specialized AI agents working collaboratively. This requires institutions to restructure, adopting new management strategies and workflows to leverage the power and inherent \"inefficiencies\" of parallel AI processing for unprecedented scientific discovery."

    "title": "Labour and technology at the time of Covid-19. Can artificial intelligence mitigate the need for proximity?",
    "abstract": "Social distancing has become worldwide the key public policy to be implemented during the COVID-19 epidemic and reducing the degree of proximity among workers turned out to be an important dimension. An emerging literature looks at the role of automation in supporting the work of humans but the potential of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to inﬂuence the need for physical proximity on the workplace has been left largely unexplored. By using a unique and innovative dataset that combines data on advancements of AI at the occupational level with information on the required proximity in the job-place and administrative employer-employee data on job ﬂows, our results show that AI and proximity stand in an inverse U-shape relationship at the sectoral level, with high advancements in AI that are negatively associated with proximity. We detect this pattern among sectors that were closed due to the lockdown measures as well as among sectors that remained open. We argue that, apart from the expected gains in productivity and competitiveness, preserving jobs and economic activities in a situation of high contagion may be the additional beneﬁts of a policy favouring digitization.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the relationship between AI adoption and workplace proximity, finding an inverse U-shaped correlation at the sectoral level, suggesting that advanced AI can reduce the need for close physical proximity in the workplace, even during lockdowns. This implies AI can mitigate pandemic-related restrictions and support job preservation."

    "title": "The complementary contributions of academia and industry to AI research",
    "published_date": "2024-01-04",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen fast paced development in industry and academia. However, striking recent advances by industry have stunned the field, inviting a fresh perspective on the role of academic research on this progress. Here, we characterize the impact and type of AI produced by both environments over the last 25 years and establish several patterns. We find that articles published by teams consisting exclusively of industry researchers tend to get greater attention, with a higher chance of being highly cited and citation-disruptive, and several times more likely to produce state-of-the-art models. In contrast, we find that exclusively academic teams publish the bulk of AI research and tend to produce higher novelty work, with single papers having several times higher likelihood of being unconventional and atypical. The respective impact-novelty advantages of industry and academia are robust to controls for subfield, team size, seniority, and prestige. We find that academic-industry collaborations produce the most impactful work overall but do not have the novelty level of academic teams. Together, our findings identify the unique and nearly irreplaceable contributions that both academia and industry make toward the progress of AI.",
    "summary": "Industry AI research produces more impactful, highly-cited work, while academia generates significantly more novel research; collaborations between the two yield the highest overall impact, highlighting the complementary nature of their contributions to AI advancement."

    "published_date": "2024-10-21",
    "summary": "The article argues that discussions of AI concentration are unclear, proposing three distinct dimensions—concentration of development, service provision, and control—that should be analyzed separately. These dimensions can vary independently, impacting predictions of AI's trajectory and necessitating nuanced policy considerations."

They also introduce \"TEDAI\" (Top-human-Expert-Dominating AI) as a distinct, qualitatively superior capability level, beyond which lie \"very generally superhuman AIs.\""

    "title": "Large Language Models at Work in China's Labor Market",
    "published_date": "2023-08-17",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the potential impacts of large language models (LLMs) on the Chinese labor market. We analyze occupational exposure to LLM capabilities by incorporating human expertise and LLM classifications, following Eloundou et al. (2023)'s methodology. We then aggregate occupation exposure to the industry level to obtain industry exposure scores. The results indicate a positive correlation between occupation exposure and wage levels/experience premiums, suggesting higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater displacement risks from LLM-powered software. The industry exposure scores align with expert assessments and economic intuitions. We also develop an economic growth model incorporating industry exposure to quantify the productivity-employment trade-off from AI adoption. Overall, this study provides an analytical basis for understanding the labor market impacts of increasingly capable AI systems in China. Key innovations include the occupation-level exposure analysis, industry aggregation approach, and economic modeling incorporating AI adoption and labor market effects. The findings will inform policymakers and businesses on strategies for maximizing the benefits of AI while mitigating adverse disruption risks.",

    "title": "Skills or Degree? The Rise of Skill-Based Hiring for AI and Green Jobs",
    "published_date": "2023-12-19",
    "abstract": "Emerging professions in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sustainability (green jobs) are experiencing labour shortages as industry demand outpaces labour supply. In this context, our study aims to understand whether employers have begun focusing more on individual skills rather than formal qualifications in their recruitment processes. We analysed a large time-series dataset of approximately eleven million online job vacancies in the UK from 2018 to mid-2024, drawing on diverse literature on technological change and labour market signalling. Our findings provide evidence that employers have initiated\"skill-based hiring\"for AI roles, adopting more flexible hiring practices to expand the available talent pool. From 2018-2023, demand for AI roles grew by 21% as a proportion of all postings (and accelerated into 2024). Simultaneously, mentions of university education requirements for AI roles declined by 15%. Our regression analysis shows that university degrees have a significantly lower wage premium for both AI and green roles. In contrast, AI skills command a wage premium of 23%, exceeding the value of degrees up until the PhD-level (33%). In occupations with high demand for AI skills, the premium for skills is high, and the reward for degrees is relatively low. We recommend leveraging alternative skill-building formats such as apprenticeships, on-the-job training, MOOCs, vocational education and training, micro-certificates, and online bootcamps to fully utilise human capital and address talent shortages.",
    "citation_count": 3,
    "summary": "A study of UK job postings from 2018-2024 reveals a shift towards skills-based hiring in AI and green jobs, with a declining emphasis on formal education and a significant wage premium for AI skills exceeding that of degrees. This suggests that alternative skill-building pathways can effectively address talent shortages in these high-demand sectors."
