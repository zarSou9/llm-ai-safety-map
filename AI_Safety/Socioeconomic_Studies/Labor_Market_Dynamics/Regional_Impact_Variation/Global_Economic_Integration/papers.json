    "title": "AI Diffusion to Low-Middle Income Countries; A Blessing or a Curse?",
    "published_date": "2024-05-30",
    "abstract": "Rapid advancements in AI have sparked significant research into its impacts on productivity and labor, which can be profoundly positive or negative. Often overlooked in this debate is understanding of how AI technologies spread across and within economies. Equally ignored are developing economies facing substantial labor market impacts from rapid, and a loss in competitiveness, from slow AI diffusion. This paper reviews literature on technology diffusion and proposes a three-way framework for understanding AI diffusion: global value chains, research collaboration, and inter-firm knowledge transfers. This is used to measure AI diffusion in sixteen low-middle-income, and four developed economies, as well as to evaluate dependence on China and the USA for access to AI technologies. The study finds a significant gap in diffusion rates between the two groups, but current trends indicate it is narrowing. China is identified as a crucial future source of AI diffusion through value chains, while the USA is more influential in research and knowledge transfers. The paper's limitations include the omission of additional data sources and countries, and the lack of investigation into the relationship between diffusion and technology intensity. Nonetheless, it raises salient macro-level questions about AI diffusion and suggests emphasis on redistribution mechanisms of AI induced economic gains, and bilateral agreements as a complement to international accords, to address diverse needs and corresponding risks faced by economies transitioning into an AI-dominated era. Additionally, it highlights the need for research into the links between AI diffusion, technology intensity, and productivity; case studies combined with targeted policy recommendations; more accurate methods for measuring AI diffusion; and a deeper investigation into its labor market impacts particular to LMICs.",

    "title": "Labour and technology at the time of Covid-19. Can artificial intelligence mitigate the need for proximity?",
    "abstract": "Social distancing has become worldwide the key public policy to be implemented during the COVID-19 epidemic and reducing the degree of proximity among workers turned out to be an important dimension. An emerging literature looks at the role of automation in supporting the work of humans but the potential of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to inﬂuence the need for physical proximity on the workplace has been left largely unexplored. By using a unique and innovative dataset that combines data on advancements of AI at the occupational level with information on the required proximity in the job-place and administrative employer-employee data on job ﬂows, our results show that AI and proximity stand in an inverse U-shape relationship at the sectoral level, with high advancements in AI that are negatively associated with proximity. We detect this pattern among sectors that were closed due to the lockdown measures as well as among sectors that remained open. We argue that, apart from the expected gains in productivity and competitiveness, preserving jobs and economic activities in a situation of high contagion may be the additional beneﬁts of a policy favouring digitization.",

    "title": "AI and the Opportunity for Shared Prosperity: Lessons from the History of Technology and the Economy",
    "published_date": "2024-01-18",
    "abstract": "Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) marks a pivotal moment in human history. It presents the opportunity for machines to learn, adapt, and perform tasks that have the potential to assist people, from everyday activities to their most creative and ambitious projects. It also has the potential to help businesses and organizations harness knowledge, increase productivity, innovate, transform, and power shared prosperity. This tremendous potential raises two fundamental questions: (1) Will AI actually advance national and global economic transformation to benefit society at large? and (2) What issues must we get right to fully realize AI's economic value, expand prosperity and improve lives everywhere? We explore these questions by considering the recent history of technology and innovation as a guide for the likely impact of AI and what we must do to realize its economic potential to benefit society. While we do not presume the future will be entirely like that past, for reasons we will discuss, we do believe prior experience with technological change offers many useful lessons. We conclude that while progress in AI presents a historic opportunity to advance our economic prosperity and future wellbeing, its economic benefits will not come automatically and that AI risks exacerbating existing economic challenges unless we collectively and purposefully act to enable its potential and address its challenges. We suggest a collective policy agenda - involving developers, deployers and users of AI, infrastructure providers, policymakers, and those involved in workforce training - that may help both realize and harness AI's economic potential and address its risks to our shared prosperity.",

    "summary": "This paper examines the potential of AI to drive shared prosperity, arguing that while AI offers immense economic opportunities, its benefits won't be automatic and require proactive policies addressing potential risks and ensuring equitable distribution of its advantages."

    "title": "The Turing Valley: How AI Capabilities Shape Labor Income",
    "published_date": "2024-08-29",
    "abstract": "Do improvements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) benefit workers? We study how AI capabilities influence labor income in a competitive economy where production requires multidimensional knowledge, and firms organize production by matching humans and AI-powered machines in hierarchies designed to use knowledge efficiently. We show that advancements in AI in dimensions where machines underperform humans decrease total labor income, while advancements in dimensions where machines outperform humans increase it. Hence, if AI initially underperforms humans in all dimensions and improves gradually, total labor income initially declines before rising. We also characterize the AI that maximizes labor income. When humans are sufficiently weak in all knowledge dimensions, labor income is maximized when AI is as good as possible in all dimensions. Otherwise, labor income is maximized when AI simultaneously performs as poorly as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively strong and as well as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively weak. Our results suggest that choosing the direction of AI development can create significant divisions between the interests of labor and capital.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of AI advancements on labor income, finding that improvements in AI capabilities relative to human skills initially decrease total labor income before increasing it, creating a potential conflict between labor and capital interests depending on the direction of AI development."

    "title": "Can apparent bystanders distinctively shape an outcome? Global south countries and global catastrophic risk-focused governance of artificial intelligence",
    "published_date": "2023-12-07",
    "abstract": "Increasingly, there is well-grounded concern that through perpetual scaling-up of computation power and data, current deep learning techniques will create highly capable artificial intelligence that could pursue goals in a manner that is not aligned with human values. In turn, such AI could have the potential of leading to a scenario in which there is serious global-scale damage to human wellbeing. Against this backdrop, a number of researchers and public policy professionals have been developing ideas about how to govern AI in a manner that reduces the chances that it could lead to a global catastrophe. The jurisdictional focus of a vast majority of their assessments so far has been the United States, China, and Europe. That preference seems to reveal an assumption underlying most of the work in this field: That global south countries can only have a marginal role in attempts to govern AI development from a global catastrophic risk -focused perspective. Our paper sets out to undermine this assumption. We argue that global south countries like India and Singapore (and specific coalitions) could in fact be fairly consequential in the global catastrophic risk-focused governance of AI. We support our position using 4 key claims. 3 are constructed out of the current ways in which advanced foundational AI models are built and used while one is constructed on the strategic roles that global south countries and coalitions have historically played in the design and use of multilateral rules and institutions. As each claim is elaborated, we also suggest some ways through which global south countries can play a positive role in designing, strengthening and operationalizing global catastrophic risk-focused AI governance.",
    "summary": "This paper challenges the assumption that Global South countries have only a marginal role in AI governance focused on global catastrophic risk, arguing that nations like India and Singapore can significantly influence AI development and the creation of multilateral rules through their unique technological capabilities and historical strategic roles. The authors support this claim with four key arguments and suggest ways Global South countries can actively participate in shaping AI governance."

    "title": "To AI or not to AI, to Buy Local or not to Buy Local: A Mathematical Theory of Real Price",
    "published_date": "2023-05-09",
    "abstract": "In the past several decades, the world's economy has become increasingly globalized. On the other hand, there are also ideas advocating the practice of ``buy local'', by which people buy locally produced goods and services rather than those produced farther away. In this paper, we establish a mathematical theory of real price that determines the optimal global versus local spending of an agent which achieves the agent's optimal tradeoff between spending and obtained utility. Our theory of real price depends on the asymptotic analysis of a Markov chain transition probability matrix related to the network of producers and consumers. We show that the real price of a product or service can be determined from the involved Markov chain matrix, and can be dramatically different from the product's label price. In particular, we show that the label prices of products and services are often not ``real'' or directly ``useful'': given two products offering the same myopic utility, the one with lower label price may not necessarily offer better asymptotic utility. This theory shows that the globality or locality of the products and services does have different impacts on the spending-utility tradeoff of a customer. The established mathematical theory of real price can be used to determine whether to adopt or not to adopt certain artificial intelligence (AI) technologies from an economic perspective.",
    "summary": "This paper develops a mathematical theory of \"real price,\" incorporating network effects and asymptotic analysis of Markov chains, to model optimal consumer spending decisions between local and global goods and services. The theory reveals that \"real price\" can significantly differ from labeled price, impacting utility and providing a framework for evaluating AI technology adoption economically."

    "title": "The Transformative Effects of AI on International Economics",
    "published_date": "2023-12-09",
    "abstract": "As AI adoption accelerates, research on its economic impacts becomes a salient source to consider for stakeholders of AI policy. Such research is however still in its infancy, and one in need of review. This paper aims to accomplish just that and is structured around two main themes. Firstly, the path towards transformative AI, and secondly the wealth created by it. It is found that sectors most embedded into global value chains will drive economic impacts, hence special attention is paid to the international trade perspective. When it comes to the path towards transformative AI, research is heterogenous in its predictions, with some predicting rapid, unhindered adoption, and others taking a more conservative view based on potential bottlenecks and comparisons to past disruptive technologies. As for wealth creation, while some agreement is to be found in AI's growth boosting abilities, predictions on timelines are lacking. Consensus exists however around the dispersion of AI induced wealth, which is heavily biased towards developed countries due to phenomena such as anchoring and reduced bargaining power of developing countries. Finally, a shortcoming of economic growth models in failing to consider AI risk is discovered. Based on the review, a calculated, and slower adoption rate of AI technologies is recommended.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "This paper reviews the nascent research on AI's economic impacts, focusing on its transformative potential within international trade and the uneven distribution of resulting wealth, favoring developed nations. It concludes that a cautious, measured approach to AI adoption is warranted due to existing economic model limitations and the risk of exacerbating global inequalities."
