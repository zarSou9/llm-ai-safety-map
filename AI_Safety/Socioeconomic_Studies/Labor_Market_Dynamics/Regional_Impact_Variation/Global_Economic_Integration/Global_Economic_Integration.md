### Mini Description

Investigation of how a region's position in global economic networks and value chains influences its exposure to and ability to benefit from AI-driven labor market changes

### Description

Global Economic Integration in AI labor markets examines how regions' interconnectedness through trade, investment, and knowledge flows shapes their exposure to and ability to adapt to AI-driven changes. This research area analyzes how global value chains, multinational corporations, and international labor mobility influence the distribution of AI-related opportunities and risks across regions. Key considerations include how technological diffusion patterns, cross-border data flows, and international competition affect local labor market outcomes.

Researchers investigate how different positions within global production networks influence regions' vulnerability to AI disruption and their capacity to capture value from AI adoption. This includes studying how AI affects comparative advantages, reshores or redistributes economic activities, and transforms international division of labor. Special attention is paid to how developing regions can avoid being locked into lower-value activities as AI capabilities advance in global centers.

The field emphasizes understanding how international economic governance, trade agreements, and cross-border cooperation mechanisms influence regional AI adoption and its labor market effects. This includes examining how international standards, intellectual property regimes, and data governance frameworks shape technology transfer and skill development opportunities across regions. Researchers also study how global economic power dynamics and technological dependencies affect regions' ability to shape their AI-driven economic trajectories.
