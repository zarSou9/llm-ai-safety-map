    "title": "Connectivity for AI enabled cities -- A field survey based study of emerging economies",
    "published_date": "2025-01-16",
    "abstract": "The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various aspects of urban life, including, governance, policy and planning, healthcare, sustainability, economics, entrepreneurship, etc. Although AI immense potential for positively impacting urban living, its success depends on overcoming significant challenges, particularly in telecommunications infrastructure. Smart city applications, such as, federated learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and online financial services, require reliable Quality of Service (QoS) from telecommunications networks to ensure effective information transfer. However, with over three billion people underserved or lacking access to internet, many of these AI-driven applications are at risk of either remaining underutilized or failing altogether. Furthermore, many IoT and video-based applications in densely populated urban areas require high-quality connectivity. This paper explores these issues, focusing on the challenges that need to be mitigated to make AI succeed in emerging countries, where more than 80% of the world population resides and urban migration grows. In this context, an overview of a case study conducted in Kathmandu, Nepal, highlights citizens' aspirations for affordable, high-quality internet-based services. The findings underscore the pressing need for advanced telecommunication networks to meet diverse user requirements while addressing investment and infrastructure gaps. This discussion provides insights into bridging the digital divide and enabling AI's transformative potential in urban areas.",
    "summary": "This paper examines the crucial role of robust telecommunications infrastructure in enabling AI-driven smart city applications in emerging economies, highlighting the significant connectivity challenges and the need for improved infrastructure to bridge the digital divide and realize AI's potential. A case study in Kathmandu, Nepal, underscores the urgent need for affordable, high-quality internet access to meet diverse citizen needs."

    "title": "The Intelligence Curse",
    "published_date": "2025-01-03",
    "summary": "The article introduces the \"intelligence curse,\" arguing that the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will create rentier-like incentives for powerful actors, leading them to prioritize AGI's output over human needs and resulting in a lack of investment in human capital and societal well-being. This shift mirrors the resource curse, where reliance on easily extracted resources undermines investment in broader societal development."

    "summary": "Research automation necessitates a shift from individual AI \"scientists\" to large-scale \"research fleets\" of specialized AI agents working collaboratively. This requires institutional restructuring, mirroring the industrial and algorithmic trading revolutions, to effectively manage and leverage the capabilities and limitations of AI."

    "title": "The Emerging AI Divide in the United States",
    "published_date": "2024-04-18",
    "abstract": "The digital divide describes disparities in access to and usage of digital tooling between social and economic groups. Emerging generative artificial intelligence tools, which strongly affect productivity, could magnify the impact of these divides. However, the affordability, multi-modality, and multilingual capabilities of these tools could also make them more accessible to diverse users in comparison with previous forms of digital tooling. In this study, we characterize spatial differences in U.S. residents' knowledge of a new generative AI tool, ChatGPT, through an analysis of state- and county-level search query data. In the first six months after the tool's release, we observe the highest rates of users searching for ChatGPT in West Coast states and persistently low rates of search in Appalachian and Gulf states. Counties with the highest rates of search are relatively more urbanized and have proportionally more educated, more economically advantaged, and more Asian residents in comparison with other counties or with the U.S. average. In multilevel models adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as industry makeup, education is the strongest positive predictor of rates of search for generative AI tooling. Although generative AI technologies may be novel, early differences in uptake appear to be following familiar paths of digital marginalization.",

    "summary": "Analysis of U.S. search queries for ChatGPT reveals a widening AI divide, with higher search rates concentrated in wealthier, more educated, and urban areas, mirroring existing digital inequities rather than bridging them. Early adoption patterns suggest that access to and knowledge of generative AI tools are strongly correlated with socioeconomic factors."

    "title": "Labour and technology at the time of Covid-19. Can artificial intelligence mitigate the need for proximity?",
    "abstract": "Social distancing has become worldwide the key public policy to be implemented during the COVID-19 epidemic and reducing the degree of proximity among workers turned out to be an important dimension. An emerging literature looks at the role of automation in supporting the work of humans but the potential of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to inﬂuence the need for physical proximity on the workplace has been left largely unexplored. By using a unique and innovative dataset that combines data on advancements of AI at the occupational level with information on the required proximity in the job-place and administrative employer-employee data on job ﬂows, our results show that AI and proximity stand in an inverse U-shape relationship at the sectoral level, with high advancements in AI that are negatively associated with proximity. We detect this pattern among sectors that were closed due to the lockdown measures as well as among sectors that remained open. We argue that, apart from the expected gains in productivity and competitiveness, preserving jobs and economic activities in a situation of high contagion may be the additional beneﬁts of a policy favouring digitization.",

    "published_date": "2024-01-17",
    "abstract": "Hjort and Poulsen (2019) frames the staggered arrival of submarine Internet cables on the shores of Africa circa 2010 as a difference-in-differences natural experiment. The paper finds positive impacts of broadband on individual- and firm-level employment and nighttime light emissions. These results largely are not robust to alternative geocoding of survey locations, to correcting for a satellite changeover at end-2009, and to revisiting a definition of the treated zone that has no clear technological basis, is narrower than the spatial resolution of nearly all the data sources, and is empirically suboptimal as a representation of the geography of broadband.",
    "summary": "Hjort and Poulsen's (2019) study on the impact of fast internet access on African employment, utilizing a difference-in-differences approach, is challenged due to sensitivity to methodological choices regarding geocoding, satellite data, and the definition of the treated zone, ultimately weakening its robustness."

    "title": "The Turing Valley: How AI Capabilities Shape Labor Income",
    "published_date": "2024-08-29",
    "abstract": "Do improvements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) benefit workers? We study how AI capabilities influence labor income in a competitive economy where production requires multidimensional knowledge, and firms organize production by matching humans and AI-powered machines in hierarchies designed to use knowledge efficiently. We show that advancements in AI in dimensions where machines underperform humans decrease total labor income, while advancements in dimensions where machines outperform humans increase it. Hence, if AI initially underperforms humans in all dimensions and improves gradually, total labor income initially declines before rising. We also characterize the AI that maximizes labor income. When humans are sufficiently weak in all knowledge dimensions, labor income is maximized when AI is as good as possible in all dimensions. Otherwise, labor income is maximized when AI simultaneously performs as poorly as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively strong and as well as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively weak. Our results suggest that choosing the direction of AI development can create significant divisions between the interests of labor and capital.",
    "summary": "AI advancements increase total labor income when machines outperform humans, but decrease it when machines underperform; therefore, the impact of AI on labor income depends on the specific dimensions of AI development relative to human capabilities."
