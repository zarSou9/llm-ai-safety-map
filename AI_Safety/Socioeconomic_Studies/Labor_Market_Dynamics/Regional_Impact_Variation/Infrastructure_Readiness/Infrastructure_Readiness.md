### Mini Description

Assessment of how regional variations in digital infrastructure, technological capabilities, and support systems affect local labor market adaptation to AI

### Description

Infrastructure Readiness examines how different regions' technological and institutional capacities affect their ability to adapt to AI-driven labor market changes. This research area evaluates the critical components of digital and physical infrastructure that enable or constrain AI adoption, including computing resources, data centers, network connectivity, and educational facilities. The analysis extends beyond pure technical capabilities to encompass supporting systems like research institutions, training facilities, and technology transfer mechanisms that facilitate workforce adaptation.

A key focus is developing frameworks to assess and compare regional infrastructure preparedness for AI integration. This involves measuring both hard infrastructure components (such as broadband penetration and computing capacity) and soft infrastructure elements (including digital literacy levels and technical support ecosystems). Researchers study how infrastructure gaps create barriers to AI adoption and workforce transition, while also examining how different infrastructure configurations influence the speed and nature of labor market adaptation.

The field emphasizes understanding how infrastructure readiness interacts with other regional characteristics to shape AI outcomes. This includes analyzing how infrastructure investment decisions affect regional competitiveness, studying the relationship between infrastructure quality and workforce mobility, and identifying critical infrastructure thresholds needed to support different types of AI-driven economic activities. Particular attention is paid to developing metrics and assessment tools that can guide infrastructure development strategies and prioritize investments for maximum impact on labor market resilience.
