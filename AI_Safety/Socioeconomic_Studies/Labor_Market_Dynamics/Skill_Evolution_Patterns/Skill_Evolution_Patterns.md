### Mini Description

Study of how AI transforms skill requirements across industries, including the obsolescence of existing skills and emergence of new ones

### Description

Skill Evolution Patterns examines how AI technologies drive changes in workforce capabilities, focusing on the dynamic relationship between technological advancement and human skill requirements. This research area tracks how different skills appreciate or depreciate in value over time, identifies emerging skill categories, and develops frameworks for predicting future skill demands. Central to this work is understanding the rate and nature of skill obsolescence versus the formation of new skill requirements across different occupational categories and industries.

Researchers analyze both technical and non-technical skill transformations, examining how AI affects cognitive, manual, and social capabilities differently. This includes studying the increasing importance of human-AI collaboration skills, the evolution of domain expertise when augmented by AI tools, and the changing nature of creativity and problem-solving in AI-enabled environments. Special attention is paid to identifying which skills remain uniquely human and how these might evolve as AI capabilities advance.

A key focus is developing methodologies for measuring and forecasting skill relevance, including approaches for quantifying skill half-lives, mapping skill adjacencies, and identifying emerging skill clusters. This involves analyzing job posting data, conducting workforce surveys, and studying organizational adaptation patterns to understand how skill requirements evolve in response to AI adoption. Researchers also examine how educational and training systems can better align with these evolving skill demands, including identifying effective approaches for continuous learning and skill updating.
