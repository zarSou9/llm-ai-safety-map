    "title": "Occupation Life Cycle",
    "published_date": "2024-04-15",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the evolution of occupations within the context of industry and technology life cycles, highlighting the critical yet underexplored intersection between occupational trends and broader economic dynamics. Introducing the Occupation Life Cycle (OLC) model, we delineate five stages (i.e., growth, peak, fluctuation, maturity, and decline) to systematically explore the trajectory of occupations. Utilizing job posting data from one of China's largest recruitment platforms as a novel proxy, our study meticulously tracks the fluctuations and emerging trends in the labor market from 2018 to 2023. Through a detailed examination of representative roles, such as short video operators and data analysts, alongside emerging occupations within the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, our findings allocate occupations to specific life cycle stages, revealing insightful patterns of occupational development and decline. Our findings offer a unique perspective on the interplay between occupational evolution and economic factors, with a particular focus on the rapidly changing Chinese labor market. This study not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of OLC but also provides practical insights for policymakers, educators, and industry leaders facing the challenges of workforce planning and development in the face of technological advancement and market shifts.",

    "title": "The Turing Valley: How AI Capabilities Shape Labor Income",
    "published_date": "2024-08-29",
    "abstract": "Do improvements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) benefit workers? We study how AI capabilities influence labor income in a competitive economy where production requires multidimensional knowledge, and firms organize production by matching humans and AI-powered machines in hierarchies designed to use knowledge efficiently. We show that advancements in AI in dimensions where machines underperform humans decrease total labor income, while advancements in dimensions where machines outperform humans increase it. Hence, if AI initially underperforms humans in all dimensions and improves gradually, total labor income initially declines before rising. We also characterize the AI that maximizes labor income. When humans are sufficiently weak in all knowledge dimensions, labor income is maximized when AI is as good as possible in all dimensions. Otherwise, labor income is maximized when AI simultaneously performs as poorly as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively strong and as well as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively weak. Our results suggest that choosing the direction of AI development can create significant divisions between the interests of labor and capital.",
    "summary": "The impact of AI on labor income depends on its relative performance compared to human workers; advancements in areas where AI surpasses humans increase income, while advancements in areas where it lags decrease income, potentially leading to an initial decline before overall income rises. Optimal AI development for maximizing labor income involves strategically focusing on AI strengths relative to human capabilities."

    "title": "Job-SDF: A Multi-Granularity Dataset for Job Skill Demand Forecasting and Benchmarking",
    "published_date": "2024-06-17",
    "abstract": "In a rapidly evolving job market, skill demand forecasting is crucial as it enables policymakers and businesses to anticipate and adapt to changes, ensuring that workforce skills align with market needs, thereby enhancing productivity and competitiveness. Additionally, by identifying emerging skill requirements, it directs individuals towards relevant training and education opportunities, promoting continuous self-learning and development. However, the absence of comprehensive datasets presents a significant challenge, impeding research and the advancement of this field. To bridge this gap, we present Job-SDF, a dataset designed to train and benchmark job-skill demand forecasting models. Based on 10.35 million public job advertisements collected from major online recruitment platforms in China between 2021 and 2023, this dataset encompasses monthly recruitment demand for 2,324 types of skills across 521 companies. Our dataset uniquely enables evaluating skill demand forecasting models at various granularities, including occupation, company, and regional levels. We benchmark a range of models on this dataset, evaluating their performance in standard scenarios, in predictions focused on lower value ranges, and in the presence of structural breaks, providing new insights for further research. Our code and dataset are publicly accessible via the https://github.com/Job-SDF/benchmark.",

    "title": "Understanding the Skills Gap between Higher Education and Industry in the UK in Artificial Intelligence Sector",
    "published_date": "2024-08-20",
    "abstract": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) changes how businesses work, there's a growing need for people who can work in this sector. This paper investigates how well universities in United Kingdom offering courses in AI, prepare students for jobs in the real world. To gain insight into the differences between university curricula and industry demands we review the contents of taught courses and job advertisement portals. By using custom data scraping tools to gather information from job advertisements and university curricula, and frequency and Naive Bayes classifier analysis, this study will show exactly what skills industry is looking for. In this study we identified 12 skill categories that were used for mapping. The study showed that the university curriculum in the AI domain is well balanced in most technical skills, including Programming and Machine learning subjects, but have a gap in Data Science and Maths and Statistics sk\\ill categories.",
    "summary": "A UK study comparing AI university curricula with industry job postings reveals a curriculum imbalance, with sufficient coverage of programming and machine learning but deficiencies in data science and mathematics/statistics. The analysis used data scraping and classification techniques to identify skill gaps."

    "title": "Skills or Degree? The Rise of Skill-Based Hiring for AI and Green Jobs",
    "published_date": "2023-12-19",
    "abstract": "Emerging professions in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sustainability (green jobs) are experiencing labour shortages as industry demand outpaces labour supply. In this context, our study aims to understand whether employers have begun focusing more on individual skills rather than formal qualifications in their recruitment processes. We analysed a large time-series dataset of approximately eleven million online job vacancies in the UK from 2018 to mid-2024, drawing on diverse literature on technological change and labour market signalling. Our findings provide evidence that employers have initiated\"skill-based hiring\"for AI roles, adopting more flexible hiring practices to expand the available talent pool. From 2018-2023, demand for AI roles grew by 21% as a proportion of all postings (and accelerated into 2024). Simultaneously, mentions of university education requirements for AI roles declined by 15%. Our regression analysis shows that university degrees have a significantly lower wage premium for both AI and green roles. In contrast, AI skills command a wage premium of 23%, exceeding the value of degrees up until the PhD-level (33%). In occupations with high demand for AI skills, the premium for skills is high, and the reward for degrees is relatively low. We recommend leveraging alternative skill-building formats such as apprenticeships, on-the-job training, MOOCs, vocational education and training, micro-certificates, and online bootcamps to fully utilise human capital and address talent shortages.",
    "citation_count": 3,
    "summary": "A study of UK job postings from 2018-2024 reveals that, despite growing demand, AI and green job sectors increasingly prioritize skills over formal degrees in hiring, with skills commanding a significant wage premium. This shift suggests a move towards more flexible recruitment practices to address labor shortages."

    "title": "The Skill-Task Matching Model: Mechanism, Model Structure, and Algorithm",
    "published_date": "2023-06-21",
    "abstract": "We distinguished between the expected and actual profit of a firm. We proposed that, beyond maximizing profit, a firm's goal also encompasses minimizing the gap between expected and actual profit. Firms strive to enhance their capability to transform projects into reality through a process of trial and error, evident as a cyclical iterative optimization process. To characterize this iterative mechanism, we developed the Skill-Task Matching Model, extending the task approach in both multidimensional and iterative manners. We vectorized jobs and employees into task and skill vector spaces, respectively, while treating production techniques as a skill-task matching matrix and business strategy as a task value vector. In our model, the process of stabilizing production techniques and optimizing business strategies corresponds to the recalibration of parameters within the skill-task matching matrix and the task value vector. We constructed a feed-forward neural network algorithm to run this model and demonstrated how it can augment operational efficiency.",
    "summary": "The Skill-Task Matching Model minimizes the gap between a firm's expected and actual profit by iteratively optimizing the match between employee skills and project tasks, using a vectorized representation and a feed-forward neural network algorithm. This iterative process refines both production techniques and business strategies to enhance operational efficiency."

    "title": "Nested Skills in Labor Ecosystems: A Hidden Dimension of Human Capital",
    "published_date": "2023-03-27",
    "abstract": "Modern economies, characterized by their vast output of goods and services, operate through globally interconnected networks. As economies become more complex, so do these networks, coordinating increasingly diverse portfolios of specialized efforts and knowledge. In this study, we analyze U.S. survey data (2005--2019) to infer an underlying interdependency tree within the fabric of skill portfolios. Hierarchically constructed, this skill tree starts from widely needed, foundational abilities, constituting the root, and extends to highly specialized, niche skills required by select jobs at the extremities. The directionality is defined by the asymmetrical conditional probabilities of the presence of one skill given the existence of another. Examining 70 million job transitions in resumes and national surveys, we observe that individuals tend to delve deeper into these nested specialization paths as they ascend the career ladder to enjoy higher wage premiums. Nevertheless, we find the role of foundational skills for such ascent remains pivotal; without reinforcing them, the anticipated wage premiums may vanish. Hence, we further differentiate \\textit{nested} skills from others, with the former building on common prerequisites while the latter does not, and analyze disparities in these skill gaps across different genders and racial/ethnic groups. Our analysis reveals a growing and concerning fragmentation in the divide between these two skill groups over the past two decades, suggesting further polarization within the job landscape. Our findings highlight the critical role of robust foundational skills as a stepping stone to specialization and the economic advantages it can confer, reinforcing the need for balanced skill development strategies in complex economies.",

    "summary": "This study uses U.S. job data (2005-2019) to reveal a hierarchical structure of skills, showing that specialized skills build upon foundational skills, leading to higher wages; however, disparities in foundational skills across demographic groups contribute to growing economic inequality."
