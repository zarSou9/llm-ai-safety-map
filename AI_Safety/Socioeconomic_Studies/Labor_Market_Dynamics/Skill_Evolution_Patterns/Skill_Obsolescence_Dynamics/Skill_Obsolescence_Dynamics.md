### Mini Description

Analysis of how and why specific skills become obsolete due to AI advancement, including patterns and rates of depreciation across different skill categories

### Description

Skill Obsolescence Dynamics investigates the mechanisms, patterns, and rates at which professional capabilities become less valuable or irrelevant due to AI advancement. This research area examines both technical obsolescence, where skills are directly replaced by AI capabilities, and economic obsolescence, where skills remain viable but lose market value due to changing demand patterns. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting workforce disruption and developing targeted interventions to support affected workers.

Researchers analyze obsolescence through multiple lenses, including skill-specific half-lives, obsolescence cascades where the depreciation of one skill triggers the decline of related capabilities, and varying rates of obsolescence across different industry contexts and job roles. This includes studying how the introduction of new AI tools can rapidly accelerate skill depreciation, sometimes rendering previously valuable expertise obsolete within months rather than years. Special attention is paid to identifying early indicators of impending skill obsolescence and understanding how different factors - such as task complexity, skill generalizability, and AI capability growth - influence depreciation rates.

A key focus is developing predictive models that can anticipate skill obsolescence before it occurs, enabling proactive rather than reactive responses. This involves mapping the relationship between AI capability advancement and skill value, identifying which characteristics make skills more resistant to obsolescence, and understanding how workers can maintain professional relevance through continuous adaptation. The research also examines how organizational practices and industry structures influence the pace and pattern of skill obsolescence, including how different adoption rates and implementation approaches affect the timing and severity of skill depreciation.
