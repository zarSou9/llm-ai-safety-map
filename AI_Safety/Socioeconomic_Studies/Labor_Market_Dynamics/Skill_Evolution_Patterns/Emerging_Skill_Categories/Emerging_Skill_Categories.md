### Mini Description

Identification and characterization of new skill requirements arising from AI adoption, including both technical and non-technical capabilities

### Description

Emerging Skill Categories research focuses on identifying, characterizing, and predicting new competencies that become valuable as AI technologies transform work processes and organizational structures. This involves analyzing how AI adoption creates demand for novel combinations of technical, cognitive, and social capabilities, while also studying how existing skills evolve and merge to form new specialized competencies. Researchers employ various methodologies including workforce surveys, job posting analysis, and organizational case studies to detect early signals of emerging skill requirements.

A key challenge in this field is distinguishing between truly novel skill categories versus reconfigurations or extensions of existing ones. This requires developing frameworks to classify and validate new skill types, understanding their relationship to technological advancement, and assessing their potential longevity and broader applicability. Researchers also investigate how different industries and organizational contexts influence the emergence and evolution of new skill categories, including variations in adoption rates and skill value across sectors.

The field emphasizes predictive modeling to anticipate future skill demands, focusing on identifying patterns in how new skill categories emerge and stabilize. This includes studying the role of organizational innovation in skill category formation, examining how professional communities codify and standardize new competencies, and analyzing the temporal dynamics of skill emergence relative to technological development cycles. Particular attention is paid to understanding how emerging skills relate to broader trends in work automation and augmentation, helping inform strategic workforce development.
