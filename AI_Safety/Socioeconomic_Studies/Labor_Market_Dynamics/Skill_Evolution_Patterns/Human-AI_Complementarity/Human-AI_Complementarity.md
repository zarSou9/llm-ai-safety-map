### Mini Description

Study of skills that enable effective human-AI collaboration and how these evolve as AI capabilities advance

### Description

Human-AI Complementarity research examines how humans and AI systems can effectively work together by leveraging their respective strengths while mitigating weaknesses. This involves studying the unique capabilities that humans bring to human-AI partnerships, such as contextual understanding, ethical judgment, and creative problem-solving, alongside the computational and analytical strengths of AI systems. Researchers focus on identifying and developing skills that enable humans to productively interact with, guide, and oversee AI systems while maintaining meaningful agency and control.

A central challenge is understanding how human cognitive and social capabilities can be enhanced rather than replaced by AI tools. This includes investigating how domain expertise evolves when augmented by AI assistance, how intuition and experience-based judgment remain relevant, and how metacognitive skills become increasingly important for effective AI collaboration. Researchers examine patterns of successful human-AI teamwork across different domains, identifying key principles and best practices for skill development.

The field emphasizes understanding how complementarity patterns evolve as AI capabilities advance. This includes studying how humans can develop skills to effectively prompt, interpret, and validate AI outputs, maintain appropriate levels of skepticism and oversight, and understand AI systems' limitations and failure modes. Particular attention is paid to identifying which human capabilities remain essential and how these can be cultivated to ensure sustainable and beneficial human-AI collaboration.
