### Mini Description

Investigation of how skills transfer between domains and occupations as AI reshapes job requirements, including identification of portable skill sets

### Description

Cross-domain skill transfer research investigates how skills and competencies developed in one context can be effectively applied or adapted to new domains as AI technologies reshape occupational boundaries. This area examines the fundamental patterns and mechanisms that enable or inhibit skill transferability, with particular attention to how AI systems alter traditional skill transfer pathways by both creating new bridges between previously distinct domains and disrupting established transfer routes.

Researchers focus on identifying and measuring skill adjacencies - the degree to which skills from different domains overlap or complement each other - and how these relationships evolve with AI adoption. This includes developing frameworks for mapping skill similarity networks, quantifying transfer difficulty, and predicting which skills will have high transfer value across multiple domains. Special attention is paid to understanding how AI tools can either facilitate or complicate skill transfer by changing the underlying cognitive and practical requirements of tasks.

A key challenge is understanding how the abstractness or concreteness of skills affects their transferability, particularly as AI systems increasingly handle domain-specific technical details. This has led to growing interest in meta-skills - higher-order capabilities that enable effective learning and adaptation across domains - and how they might become increasingly valuable in an AI-driven economy. Researchers also examine how organizational practices and policy interventions can better support cross-domain skill transfer, including the design of training programs that maximize skill portability.
