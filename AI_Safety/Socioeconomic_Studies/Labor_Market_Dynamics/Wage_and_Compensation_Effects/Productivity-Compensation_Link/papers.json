    "title": "Artificial Intelligence, Income Distribution and Economic Growth",
    "abstract": "The economic impact of Articial Intelligence (AI) is studied using a (semi) endogenous growth model with two novel features. First, the task approach from labor economics is reformulated and integrated into a growth model. Second, the standard representative household assumption is rejected, so that aggregate demand restrictions can be introduced. With these novel features it is shown that (i) AI automation can decrease the share of labor income no matter the size of the elasticity of substitution between AI and labor, and (ii) when this elasticity is high, AI will unambiguously reduce aggregate demand and slow down GDP growth, even in the face of the positive technology shock that AI entails. If the elasticity of substitution is low, then GDP, productivity and wage growth may however still slow down, because the economy will then fail to benefit from the supply-side driven capacity expansion potential that AI can deliver. The model can thus explain why advanced countries tend to experience, despite much AI hype, the simultaneous existence of rather high employment with stagnating wages, productivity, and GDP.",

    "title": "The macroeconomic consequences of artificial intelligence: A theoretical framework",
    "abstract": "The authors explore the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy by improving the neoclassical production function and the task-based model. Based on the capital accumulation of artificial intelligence and technological progress, they present a theoretical model that explores the effect of alternative and complementary artificial intelligence on wages, capital prices, labor share, capital share and economic growth. The model shows that artificial intelligence capital lowers the capital prices and increases wages. In addition, if artificial intelligence and labor force are complementary, artificial intelligence capital has a positive impact on labor share, but if artificial intelligence and labor force can substitute each other, labor share is negatively influenced by artificial intelligence capital. The authors extend the task-based model and find that technological progress increases both wages and labor share by generating new tasks. In the long run, without consideration of exogenous technology, as the artificial intelligence capital accumulates, per capita output, per capita traditional capital and per capita artificial intelligence capital grow at the same rate, and economic growth finally reaches steady state equili- brium. With exogenous technology considered, artificial intelligence technology improves, and sustained economic growth is achieved.",

    "title": "Labour and technology at the time of Covid-19. Can artificial intelligence mitigate the need for proximity?",
    "abstract": "Social distancing has become worldwide the key public policy to be implemented during the COVID-19 epidemic and reducing the degree of proximity among workers turned out to be an important dimension. An emerging literature looks at the role of automation in supporting the work of humans but the potential of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to inﬂuence the need for physical proximity on the workplace has been left largely unexplored. By using a unique and innovative dataset that combines data on advancements of AI at the occupational level with information on the required proximity in the job-place and administrative employer-employee data on job ﬂows, our results show that AI and proximity stand in an inverse U-shape relationship at the sectoral level, with high advancements in AI that are negatively associated with proximity. We detect this pattern among sectors that were closed due to the lockdown measures as well as among sectors that remained open. We argue that, apart from the expected gains in productivity and competitiveness, preserving jobs and economic activities in a situation of high contagion may be the additional beneﬁts of a policy favouring digitization.",

    "published_date": "2024-09-04",
    "abstract": "This paper derives\"scaling laws\"--empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their performance--for economic outcomes. In a preregistered online experiment, 300 professional translators completed 1,800 tasks using one of 13 LLMs (or a control). A tenfold increase in model compute improved task completion speed by 12.3%, grades by 0.18 standard deviations, and earnings per minute by 16.1%. Gains were four times larger for lower-skilled workers. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by at least 6.9% over the next decade.",

    "summary": "An experiment with professional translators using 13 LLMs found that increased model training compute significantly improved translation speed, quality, and earnings, with larger gains for less-skilled workers, suggesting substantial potential for productivity increases in the U.S. economy."

    "title": "AI and Jobs: Has the Inflection Point Arrived? Evidence from an Online Labor Platform",
    "published_date": "2023-12-07",
    "abstract": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has renewed the debate on the important issue of\"technology displacement\". While prior research has investigated the effect of information technology in general on human labor from a macro perspective, this paper complements the literature by examining the impact of LLMs on freelancers from a micro perspective. Specifically, we leverage the release of ChatGPT to investigate how AI influences freelancers across different online labor markets (OLMs). Employing the Difference-in-Differences method, we discovered two distinct scenarios following ChatGPT's release: 1) the displacement effect of LLMs, featuring reduced work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the translation&localization OLM; 2) the productivity effect of LLMs, featuring increased work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the web development OLM. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we developed a Cournot-type competition model to highlight the existence of an inflection point for each occupation which separates the timeline of AI progress into a honeymoon phase and a substitution phase. Before AI performance crosses the inflection point, human labor benefits each time AI improves, resulting in the honeymoon phase. However, after AI performance crosses the inflection point, additional AI enhancement hurts human labor. Further analyzing the progression from ChatGPT 3.5 to 4.0, we found three effect scenarios (i.e., productivity to productivity, displacement to displacement, and productivity to displacement), consistent with the inflection point conjecture. Heterogeneous analyses reveal that U.S. web developers tend to benefit more from the release of ChatGPT compared to their counterparts in other regions, and somewhat surprisingly, experienced translators seem more likely to exit the market than less experienced translators after the release of ChatGPT.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "Using data from an online labor platform, this study finds that the impact of LLMs on freelancers varies by occupation, showing both increased productivity (e.g., web development) and displacement (e.g., translation) effects depending on whether AI performance surpasses an occupation-specific inflection point. This inflection point separates an initial \"honeymoon\" phase of increased productivity from a subsequent substitution phase of reduced work."

    "title": "GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models",
    "published_date": "2023-03-17",
    "abstract": "We investigate the potential implications of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), on the U.S. labor market, focusing on the increased capabilities arising from LLM-powered software compared to LLMs on their own. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56% of all tasks. This finding implies that LLM-powered software will have a substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs could significantly impact the US labor market, with up to 80% of workers potentially experiencing at least 10% task automation, and this impact is amplified by LLM-powered software, potentially affecting 47-56% of all tasks. The effects are projected across all wage levels, suggesting LLMs are a general-purpose technology with broad economic implications."

    "published_date": "2023-04-01",
    "abstract": "We study the staggered introduction of a generative AI-based conversational assistant using data from 5,172 customer support agents. Access to AI assistance increases worker productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 15\\% on average, with substantial heterogeneity across workers. Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve both the speed and quality of their output while the most experienced and highest-skilled workers see small gains in speed and small declines in quality. We also find evidence that AI assistance facilitates worker learning and improves English fluency, particularly among international agents. While AI systems improve with more training data, we find that the gains from AI adoption are largest for relatively rare problems, where human agents have less baseline training and experience. Finally, we provide evidence that AI assistance improves the experience of work along two key dimensions: customers are more polite and less likely to ask to speak to a manager.",

    "published_date": "2023-12-09",
    "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape the knowledge economy by enabling problem solving at scale. This paper introduces a framework to analyze this transformation, incorporating AI into an economy where humans form hierarchical firms to use their time efficiently: Less knowledgeable individuals become\"workers\"solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable individuals become\"solvers\"assisting workers with exceptional problems. We model AI as a technology that transforms computing power into\"AI agents,\"which can either operate autonomously (as co-workers or solvers/co-pilots) or non-autonomously (only as co-pilots). We show that basic autonomous AI displaces humans towards specialized problem solving, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced autonomous AI reallocates humans to routine work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. While autonomous AI primarily benefits the most knowledgeable individuals, non-autonomous AI disproportionately benefits the least knowledgeable. However, autonomous AI achieves higher overall output. These findings reconcile seemingly contradictory empirical evidence and reveal key tradeoffs involved in regulating AI autonomy.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of AI on a hierarchical knowledge economy, finding that basic autonomous AI shrinks firms while advanced autonomous AI expands them, with the latter yielding higher overall output but benefiting the most knowledgeable individuals disproportionately. Non-autonomous AI, conversely, primarily benefits the least knowledgeable."
