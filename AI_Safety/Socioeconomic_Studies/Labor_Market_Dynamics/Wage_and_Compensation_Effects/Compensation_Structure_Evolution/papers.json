    "abstract": "We analyze how output and wages behave under different scenarios for technological progress that may culminate in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), defined as the ability of AI systems to perform all tasks that humans can perform. We assume that human work can be decomposed into atomistic tasks that differ in their complexity. Advances in technology make ever more complex tasks amenable to automation. The effects on wages depend on a race between automation and capital accumulation. If the distribution of task complexity exhibits a sufficiently thick infinite tail, then there is always enough work for humans, and wages may rise forever. By contrast, if the complexity of tasks that humans can perform is bounded and full automation is reached, then wages collapse. But declines may occur even before if large-scale automation outpaces capital accumulation and makes labor too abundant. Automating productivity growth may lead to broad-based gains in the returns to all factors. By contrast, bottlenecks to growth from irreproducible scarce factors may exacerbate the decline in wages.",

    "summary": "The paper models the economic impact of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), finding that wage outcomes depend on the interplay between automation's speed, capital accumulation, and the distribution of task complexity; a sufficiently complex task distribution allows for perpetual wage growth, while bounded complexity leads to wage collapse under full automation."

    "title": "The Turing Valley: How AI Capabilities Shape Labor Income",
    "published_date": "2024-08-29",
    "abstract": "Do improvements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) benefit workers? We study how AI capabilities influence labor income in a competitive economy where production requires multidimensional knowledge, and firms organize production by matching humans and AI-powered machines in hierarchies designed to use knowledge efficiently. We show that advancements in AI in dimensions where machines underperform humans decrease total labor income, while advancements in dimensions where machines outperform humans increase it. Hence, if AI initially underperforms humans in all dimensions and improves gradually, total labor income initially declines before rising. We also characterize the AI that maximizes labor income. When humans are sufficiently weak in all knowledge dimensions, labor income is maximized when AI is as good as possible in all dimensions. Otherwise, labor income is maximized when AI simultaneously performs as poorly as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively strong and as well as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively weak. Our results suggest that choosing the direction of AI development can create significant divisions between the interests of labor and capital.",
    "summary": "The paper models how AI advancements affect labor income, finding that improvements in areas where AI surpasses humans increase income, while improvements in areas where AI lags behind humans decrease it, leading to a potential initial decline in income before a subsequent rise. This suggests that AI development direction significantly impacts the alignment of labor and capital interests."

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence, Income Distribution and Economic Growth",
    "abstract": "The economic impact of Articial Intelligence (AI) is studied using a (semi) endogenous growth model with two novel features. First, the task approach from labor economics is reformulated and integrated into a growth model. Second, the standard representative household assumption is rejected, so that aggregate demand restrictions can be introduced. With these novel features it is shown that (i) AI automation can decrease the share of labor income no matter the size of the elasticity of substitution between AI and labor, and (ii) when this elasticity is high, AI will unambiguously reduce aggregate demand and slow down GDP growth, even in the face of the positive technology shock that AI entails. If the elasticity of substitution is low, then GDP, productivity and wage growth may however still slow down, because the economy will then fail to benefit from the supply-side driven capacity expansion potential that AI can deliver. The model can thus explain why advanced countries tend to experience, despite much AI hype, the simultaneous existence of rather high employment with stagnating wages, productivity, and GDP.",

    "summary": "A new economic growth model incorporating AI automation and heterogeneous households demonstrates that AI can decrease labor income share regardless of AI-labor substitutability, and may reduce aggregate demand and GDP growth, especially when AI and labor are highly substitutable. Even with low substitutability, AI may still slow growth by hindering the realization of AI's supply-side potential."

    "title": "The macroeconomic consequences of artificial intelligence: A theoretical framework",
    "abstract": "The authors explore the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy by improving the neoclassical production function and the task-based model. Based on the capital accumulation of artificial intelligence and technological progress, they present a theoretical model that explores the effect of alternative and complementary artificial intelligence on wages, capital prices, labor share, capital share and economic growth. The model shows that artificial intelligence capital lowers the capital prices and increases wages. In addition, if artificial intelligence and labor force are complementary, artificial intelligence capital has a positive impact on labor share, but if artificial intelligence and labor force can substitute each other, labor share is negatively influenced by artificial intelligence capital. The authors extend the task-based model and find that technological progress increases both wages and labor share by generating new tasks. In the long run, without consideration of exogenous technology, as the artificial intelligence capital accumulates, per capita output, per capita traditional capital and per capita artificial intelligence capital grow at the same rate, and economic growth finally reaches steady state equili- brium. With exogenous technology considered, artificial intelligence technology improves, and sustained economic growth is achieved.",

    "published_date": "2023-12-09",
    "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape the knowledge economy by enabling problem solving at scale. This paper introduces a framework to analyze this transformation, incorporating AI into an economy where humans form hierarchical firms to use their time efficiently: Less knowledgeable individuals become\"workers\"solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable individuals become\"solvers\"assisting workers with exceptional problems. We model AI as a technology that transforms computing power into\"AI agents,\"which can either operate autonomously (as co-workers or solvers/co-pilots) or non-autonomously (only as co-pilots). We show that basic autonomous AI displaces humans towards specialized problem solving, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced autonomous AI reallocates humans to routine work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. While autonomous AI primarily benefits the most knowledgeable individuals, non-autonomous AI disproportionately benefits the least knowledgeable. However, autonomous AI achieves higher overall output. These findings reconcile seemingly contradictory empirical evidence and reveal key tradeoffs involved in regulating AI autonomy.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of AI on a hierarchical knowledge economy, finding that basic autonomous AI leads to smaller, less productive firms while advanced autonomous AI creates larger, more productive ones; the benefits of AI autonomy are skewed towards highly knowledgeable individuals, while non-autonomous AI disproportionately benefits less knowledgeable individuals."

    "abstract": "What will likely be the effect of the emergence of ChatGPT and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI) on the skill premium? To address this question, we develop a nested constant elasticity of substitution production function that distinguishes between industrial robots and AI. Industrial robots predominantly substitute for low-skill workers, whereas AI mainly helps to perform the tasks of high-skill workers. We show that AI reduces the skill premium as long as it is more substitutable for high-skill workers than low-skill workers are for high-skill workers.",
