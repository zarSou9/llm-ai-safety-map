### Mini Description

Analysis of which specific tasks within jobs are susceptible to automation, including methodologies for decomposing jobs into constituent tasks and evaluating AI capability to perform them

### Description

Task Automation Assessment involves systematically analyzing job roles to identify which components can be automated by AI systems, requiring detailed decomposition of work activities into fundamental tasks and evaluation of AI capabilities against these tasks. This research area combines insights from cognitive science, organizational psychology, and computer science to develop frameworks for understanding the granular nature of human work and mapping it to current and projected AI capabilities.

A key challenge is developing robust methodologies for task decomposition that capture both explicit and implicit aspects of work. While some tasks can be clearly defined and measured, others involve tacit knowledge, contextual understanding, or complex social interactions that are harder to formally specify. Researchers must also account for how tasks interact and depend on each other within broader workflows, as automation of one component may affect the nature and difficulty of related tasks.

The field emphasizes creating standardized frameworks for assessing automation potential across different types of tasks, from routine cognitive operations to complex decision-making processes. This includes developing taxonomies of task types, identifying key capabilities required for different tasks, and creating metrics for assessing AI readiness to perform specific functions. Researchers also study how task characteristics like predictability, required dexterity, and need for social intelligence influence automation potential.
