    "published_date": "2024-05-06",
    "summary": "The article presents GDP per capita forecasts for major economies until 2050, projecting significant increases in living standards even without transformative AI growth; these forecasts suggest a radically different world by 2050 compared to today, with many developing nations approaching the current living standards of wealthier nations."

    "published_date": "2022-09-11",
    "summary": "Due to survival bias, we underestimate the likelihood and proximity of climate tipping points, making Earth more vulnerable to even small human actions. This \"anthropic fragility\" increases the probability of human extinction via runaway global warming and necessitates urgent geoengineering research."

    "published_date": "2021-07-08",
    "summary": "The MineRL BASALT competition introduces a new benchmark for AI systems learning from human feedback, using Minecraft's open-ended environment to evaluate agents based on human judgment rather than pre-defined reward functions, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks like Atari and MuJoCo. This approach aims to foster research on AI systems that reliably learn objectives from human input, mitigating risks associated with misspecified goals."

    "title": "Impacts of the Use of Machine Learning on Work Design",
    "abstract": "The increased pervasiveness of technological advancements in automation makes it urgent to address the question of how work is changing in response. Focusing on applications of machine learning (ML) to automate information tasks, we draw on a simple framework for identifying the impacts of an automated system on a task that suggests 3 patterns for the use of ML-decision support, blended decision making and complete automation. In this paper, we extend this framework by considering how automation of one task might have implications for interdependent tasks and how automation applies to coordination mechanisms.",

    "title": "A decision support model for the operational management of employee redeployment in large governmental organisations",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The rapid and appropriate redeployment of employees among workplaces is a common task for companies that consist of many organizational units geographically distributed across the country. The redeployment requires matching of the employee's education, skills and competences to the work unit requirements. In this paper, we present a decision support model for employee redeployment and selection of the best candidate for a given position in a large governmental organisation geographically distributed in many organisational units throughout the country. The proposed decision support model can be used in general or may be adapted to fit the organizational needs and the configuration of the specific conditions of the different organisational units. Once defined, the decision support model aids the decision-maker in the process of candidates' evaluations for the selected working places that significantly accelerate the selection process of candidates for redeployment.",

The model is adaptable to various organizational structures and needs."

    "published_date": "2018-11-06",
    "summary": "Nick Bostrom's \"Vulnerable World Hypothesis\" posits that continued technological development increases the likelihood of civilization-ending events unless global governance significantly improves. This risk stems from both easily accessible destructive technologies and the incentives for powerful or numerous actors to utilize them in a semi-anarchic world order."
