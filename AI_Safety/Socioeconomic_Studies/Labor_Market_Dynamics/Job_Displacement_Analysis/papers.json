    "title": "Labour and technology at the time of Covid-19. Can artificial intelligence mitigate the need for proximity?",
    "abstract": "Social distancing has become worldwide the key public policy to be implemented during the COVID-19 epidemic and reducing the degree of proximity among workers turned out to be an important dimension. An emerging literature looks at the role of automation in supporting the work of humans but the potential of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to inﬂuence the need for physical proximity on the workplace has been left largely unexplored. By using a unique and innovative dataset that combines data on advancements of AI at the occupational level with information on the required proximity in the job-place and administrative employer-employee data on job ﬂows, our results show that AI and proximity stand in an inverse U-shape relationship at the sectoral level, with high advancements in AI that are negatively associated with proximity. We detect this pattern among sectors that were closed due to the lockdown measures as well as among sectors that remained open. We argue that, apart from the expected gains in productivity and competitiveness, preserving jobs and economic activities in a situation of high contagion may be the additional beneﬁts of a policy favouring digitization.",

    "title": "In the Shadow of Smith's Invisible Hand: Risks to Economic Stability and Social Wellbeing in the Age of Intelligence",
    "published_date": "2024-04-22",
    "abstract": "Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing financial security, identity, purpose, and social integration. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job displacement. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour underutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index by 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary. Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study underscores the need for governments, civic organisations, and business to work together to ensure a smooth transition to an AI- dominated economy to safeguard the Mental Wealth of nations.",

    "summary": "Using a system dynamics model, this study finds that even moderate increases in AI adoption could significantly increase labor underutilization and decrease per capita income by mid-2050, highlighting the urgent need for proactive government intervention and job creation to mitigate potential economic instability."

    "title": "AI and Jobs: Has the Inflection Point Arrived? Evidence from an Online Labor Platform",
    "published_date": "2023-12-07",
    "abstract": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has renewed the debate on the important issue of\"technology displacement\". While prior research has investigated the effect of information technology in general on human labor from a macro perspective, this paper complements the literature by examining the impact of LLMs on freelancers from a micro perspective. Specifically, we leverage the release of ChatGPT to investigate how AI influences freelancers across different online labor markets (OLMs). Employing the Difference-in-Differences method, we discovered two distinct scenarios following ChatGPT's release: 1) the displacement effect of LLMs, featuring reduced work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the translation&localization OLM; 2) the productivity effect of LLMs, featuring increased work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the web development OLM. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we developed a Cournot-type competition model to highlight the existence of an inflection point for each occupation which separates the timeline of AI progress into a honeymoon phase and a substitution phase. Before AI performance crosses the inflection point, human labor benefits each time AI improves, resulting in the honeymoon phase. However, after AI performance crosses the inflection point, additional AI enhancement hurts human labor. Further analyzing the progression from ChatGPT 3.5 to 4.0, we found three effect scenarios (i.e., productivity to productivity, displacement to displacement, and productivity to displacement), consistent with the inflection point conjecture. Heterogeneous analyses reveal that U.S. web developers tend to benefit more from the release of ChatGPT compared to their counterparts in other regions, and somewhat surprisingly, experienced translators seem more likely to exit the market than less experienced translators after the release of ChatGPT.",

    "summary": "Using online labor market data, this paper finds that Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have had contrasting effects on freelancers, causing decreased work and earnings in some sectors (e.g., translation) but increased work and earnings in others (e.g., web development), suggesting an inflection point where AI advancements transition from boosting to replacing human labor."

    "title": "Divide-and-Conquer Dynamics in AI-Driven Disempowerment",
    "published_date": "2023-10-09",
    "abstract": "AI companies are attempting to create AI systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. Current AI models are already automating away the livelihoods of some artists, actors, and writers. But there is infighting between those who prioritize current harms and future harms. We construct a game-theoretic model of conflict to study the causes and consequences of this disunity. Our model also helps explain why throughout history, stakeholders sharing a common threat have found it advantageous to unite against it, and why the common threat has in turn found it advantageous to divide and conquer. Under realistic parameter assumptions, our model makes several predictions that find preliminary corroboration in the historical-empirical record. First, current victims of AI-driven disempowerment need the future victims to realize that their interests are also under serious and imminent threat, so that future victims are incentivized to support current victims in solidarity. Second, the movement against AI-driven disempowerment can become more united, and thereby more likely to prevail, if members believe that their efforts will be successful as opposed to futile. Finally, the movement can better unite and prevail if its members are less myopic. Myopic members prioritize their future well-being less than their present well-being, and are thus disinclined to solidarily support current victims today at personal cost, even if this is necessary to counter the shared threat of AI-driven disempowerment.",
    "summary": "This paper uses game theory to model the disunity among those threatened by AI-driven job displacement, showing that current and future victims must unite against a common threat, requiring less myopia and a belief in the movement's success to overcome the \"divide and conquer\" strategy employed by AI companies."

    "title": "\"Generate\"the Future of Work through AI: Empirical Evidence from Online Labor Markets",
    "published_date": "2023-08-09",
    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) based generative AI, such as ChatGPT, is considered the first generation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), exhibiting zero-shot learning abilities for a wide variety of downstream tasks. Due to its general-purpose and emergent nature, its impact on labor dynamics becomes complex and difficult to anticipate. Leveraging an extensive dataset from a prominent online labor market, we uncover a post-ChatGPT decline in labor demand, supply, and transactions for submarkets pertaining to text-related and programming-related jobs, in comparison to those not directly exposed to ChatGPT's core functionalities. Meanwhile, these affected submarkets exhibit a discernible increase in the complexity of the remaining jobs and a heightened level of competition among freelancers. Intriguingly, our findings indicate that the diminution in the labor supply pertaining to programming is comparatively less pronounced, a phenomenon ascribed to the transition of freelancers previously engaged in text-related tasks now bidding for programming-related opportunities. Although the per-period job diversity freelancers apply for tends to be more limited, those who successfully navigate skill transitions from text to programming demonstrate greater resilience to ChatGPT's overall market contraction impact. As AI becomes increasingly versatile and potent, our paper offers crucial insights into AI's influence on labor markets and individuals' reactions, underscoring the necessity for proactive interventions to address the challenges and opportunities presented by this transformative technology.",

    "summary": "Using data from an online labor market, this paper finds that the introduction of ChatGPT led to decreased demand, supply, and transactions for text and programming jobs, increased job complexity, and heightened competition; however, programmers showed less supply reduction due to a shift of workers from text-based tasks."

    "published_date": "2023-12-09",
    "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape the knowledge economy by enabling problem solving at scale. This paper introduces a framework to analyze this transformation, incorporating AI into an economy where humans form hierarchical firms to use their time efficiently: Less knowledgeable individuals become\"workers\"solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable individuals become\"solvers\"assisting workers with exceptional problems. We model AI as a technology that transforms computing power into\"AI agents,\"which can either operate autonomously (as co-workers or solvers/co-pilots) or non-autonomously (only as co-pilots). We show that basic autonomous AI displaces humans towards specialized problem solving, leading to smaller, less productive, and less decentralized firms. In contrast, advanced autonomous AI reallocates humans to routine work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized firms. While autonomous AI primarily benefits the most knowledgeable individuals, non-autonomous AI disproportionately benefits the least knowledgeable. However, autonomous AI achieves higher overall output. These findings reconcile seemingly contradictory empirical evidence and reveal key tradeoffs involved in regulating AI autonomy.",
    "summary": "This paper models the impact of AI on hierarchical firms within a knowledge economy, finding that basic autonomous AI leads to smaller, less productive firms while advanced autonomous AI creates larger, more productive, and decentralized ones, with differing distributional effects depending on AI autonomy. The model highlights the trade-offs between AI autonomy and overall economic output and inequality."
