### Mini Description

Study of the economic factors that influence automation decisions, including cost-benefit analysis of AI deployment versus human labor and assessment of implementation barriers

### Description

Economic Viability Analysis in AI job displacement research examines the financial and operational factors that influence organizations' decisions to automate human labor. This involves developing frameworks to assess the total costs and benefits of AI deployment, including direct expenses like technology acquisition and implementation, indirect costs such as workforce transition and organizational restructuring, and potential returns through productivity gains and cost savings. Researchers analyze how different market conditions, regulatory environments, and organizational characteristics affect the economic calculus of automation decisions.

A key challenge in this field is accounting for the dynamic nature of automation costs and benefits. As AI technologies rapidly evolve, both capability boundaries and implementation costs shift, requiring flexible analytical frameworks that can adapt to changing technological and economic landscapes. Researchers must also consider various hidden costs and benefits, including impacts on organizational knowledge retention, employee morale, customer satisfaction, and brand reputation. This involves developing methodologies for quantifying traditionally intangible factors and incorporating them into decision-making frameworks.

The field emphasizes understanding how economic viability varies across different contexts and scales. This includes analyzing how factors such as labor costs, market competition, and regulatory requirements influence automation decisions across different regions and industries. Researchers also examine how organizational size, existing technological infrastructure, and workforce characteristics affect the economics of automation. A particular focus is developing predictive models that can anticipate when specific automation technologies will cross economic viability thresholds in different contexts.
