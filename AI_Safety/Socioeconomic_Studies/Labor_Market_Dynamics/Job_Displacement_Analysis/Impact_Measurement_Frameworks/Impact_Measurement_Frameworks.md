### Mini Description

Development of frameworks and metrics for measuring and monitoring actual displacement effects, including both direct job losses and indirect employment effects

### Description

Impact Measurement Frameworks focus on developing systematic approaches to quantify and track AI-driven job displacement effects across economies. These frameworks combine multiple data sources and methodological approaches to capture both immediate job losses and broader labor market transformations, including indirect effects through supply chains and economic multipliers. A key challenge is distinguishing AI-specific impacts from other technological and economic factors, requiring sophisticated attribution methods and counterfactual analysis.

Researchers in this area develop standardized metrics and measurement protocols that can be consistently applied across different contexts and timeframes. This includes establishing baseline employment measures, defining displacement events, and creating taxonomies of displacement types. The frameworks must account for various forms of displacement, from complete job elimination to substantial role transformation, while also capturing temporary versus permanent effects and voluntary versus involuntary transitions.

A critical aspect of these frameworks is their ability to capture distributional effects and heterogeneous impacts across different demographic groups, industries, and geographic regions. This involves integrating multiple measurement approaches, from large-scale administrative data analysis to detailed case studies and worker surveys. Researchers also focus on developing early warning indicators and real-time monitoring systems to enable proactive policy responses to emerging displacement trends.
