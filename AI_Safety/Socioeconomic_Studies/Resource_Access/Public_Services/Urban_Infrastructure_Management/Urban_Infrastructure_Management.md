### Mini Description

Investigation of AI applications in managing public infrastructure, including traffic systems, utilities, and municipal facilities

### Description

Urban Infrastructure Management examines how AI systems can optimize, monitor, and enhance the operation of critical city infrastructure components while ensuring equitable access and resilience. This includes the development and deployment of smart systems for managing transportation networks, energy grids, water systems, waste management, and other municipal facilities. The research focuses on both the technical challenges of integrating AI into existing infrastructure and the sociotechnical considerations of ensuring these systems serve all community members effectively.

A key challenge in this domain is developing AI systems that can handle the complex interdependencies between different infrastructure components while remaining robust to disruptions and adaptable to changing urban conditions. Researchers investigate approaches for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance, dynamic resource allocation, and coordinated responses to infrastructure stress or failure. This includes developing models that can integrate diverse data streams from sensors, user feedback, and environmental monitoring systems to support both operational decisions and long-term planning.

The field also addresses questions of infrastructure equity, sustainability, and resilience in the context of AI deployment. This involves studying how AI-driven infrastructure management affects different neighborhoods and demographic groups, developing frameworks for measuring and optimizing infrastructure performance across multiple social and environmental metrics, and ensuring that automated systems can appropriately balance competing demands for limited resources. Particular attention is paid to ensuring that AI systems can support infrastructure adaptation to climate change while maintaining service reliability and accessibility.
