    "title": "ASTM :Autonomous Smart Traffic Management System Using Artificial Intelligence CNN and LSTM",
    "published_date": "2024-10-14",
    "abstract": "In the modern world, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has contributed to improvements in various areas, including automation, computer vision, fraud detection, and more. AI can be leveraged to enhance the efficiency of Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (ASTM) systems and reduce traffic congestion rates. This paper presents an Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (STM) system that uses AI to improve traffic flow rates. The system employs the YOLO V5 Convolutional Neural Network to detect vehicles in traffic management images. Additionally, it predicts the number of vehicles for the next 12 hours using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). The Smart Traffic Management Cycle Length Analysis manages the traffic cycle length based on these vehicle predictions, aided by AI. From the results of the RNN-LSTM model for predicting vehicle numbers over the next 12 hours, we observe that the model predicts traffic with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.521 vehicles and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.232 vehicles. After simulating the STM system in the CARLA simulation environment, we found that the Traffic Management Congestion Flow Rate with ASTM (21 vehicles per minute) is 50\\% higher than the rate without STM (around 15 vehicles per minute). Additionally, the Traffic Management Vehicle Pass Delay with STM (5 seconds per vehicle) is 70\\% lower than without STM (around 12 seconds per vehicle). These results demonstrate that the STM system using AI can increase traffic flow by 50\\% and reduce vehicle pass delays by 70\\%.",

The system's LSTM model achieves a low MSE of 4.521 vehicles in predicting 12-hour traffic volume."

    "published_date": "2024-04-29",
    "abstract": "The proposed IncidentResponseGPT framework - a novel system that applies generative artificial intelligence (AI) to potentially enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of traffic incident response. This model allows for synthesis of region-specific incident response guidelines and generates incident response plans adapted to specific area, aiming to expedite decision-making for traffic management authorities. This approach aims to accelerate incident resolution times by suggesting various recommendations (e.g. optimal rerouting strategies, estimating resource needs) to minimize the overall impact on the urban traffic network. The system suggests specific actions, including dynamic lane closures, optimized rerouting and dispatching appropriate emergency resources. We utilize the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to rank generated response plans based on criteria like impact minimization and resource efficiency based on their proximity to an human-proposed solution.",

    "title": "Maintenance Strategies for Sewer Pipes with Multi-State Degradation and Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2024-06-27",
    "abstract": "Large-scale infrastructure systems are crucial for societal welfare, and their effective management requires strategic forecasting and intervention methods that account for various complexities. Our study addresses two challenges within the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) framework applied to sewer assets: modeling pipe degradation across severity levels and developing effective maintenance policies. We employ Multi-State Degradation Models (MSDM) to represent the stochastic degradation process in sewer pipes and use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to devise maintenance strategies. A case study of a Dutch sewer network exemplifies our methodology. Our findings demonstrate the model's effectiveness in generating intelligent, cost-saving maintenance strategies that surpass heuristics. It adapts its management strategy based on the pipe's age, opting for a passive approach for newer pipes and transitioning to active strategies for older ones to prevent failures and reduce costs. This research highlights DRL's potential in optimizing maintenance policies. Future research will aim improve the model by incorporating partial observability, exploring various reinforcement learning algorithms, and extending this methodology to comprehensive infrastructure management.",

    "summary": "This paper uses multi-state degradation models and deep reinforcement learning to optimize sewer pipe maintenance, demonstrating cost savings compared to heuristic methods by adapting strategies based on pipe age and condition. The resulting intelligent maintenance policies prioritize preventative measures for older pipes while delaying intervention for newer ones."

    "published_date": "2024-09-05",
    "abstract": "Efficient management of infrastructure systems is crucial for economic stability, sustainability, and public safety. However, infrastructure sustainment is challenging due to the vast scale of systems, stochastic deterioration of components, partial observability, and resource constraints. Decision-making strategies that rely solely on human judgment often result in suboptimal decisions over large scales and long horizons. While data-driven approaches like reinforcement learning offer promising solutions, their application has been limited by the lack of suitable simulation environments. We present InfraLib, an open-source modular and extensible framework that enables modeling and analyzing infrastructure management problems with resource constraints as sequential decision-making problems. The framework implements hierarchical, stochastic deterioration models, supports realistic partial observability, and handles practical constraints including cyclical budgets and component unavailability. InfraLib provides standardized environments for benchmarking decision-making approaches, along with tools for expert data collection and policy evaluation. Through case studies on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world road networks, we demonstrate InfraLib's ability to model diverse infrastructure management scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency at scale.",

    "abstract": "Urban traffic management faces significant challenges due to the dynamic environments, and traditional algorithms fail to quickly adapt to this environment in real-time and predict possible conflicts. This study explores the ability of a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically, GPT-4o-mini to improve traffic management at urban intersections.

    "published_date": "2024-11-16",
    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel approach for traffic control systems by using Large Language Models (LLMs) as traffic controllers. The study utilizes their logical reasoning, scene understanding, and decision-making capabilities to optimize throughput and provide feedback based on traffic conditions in real-time. LLMs centralize traditionally disconnected traffic control processes and can integrate traffic data from diverse sources to provide context-aware decisions. LLMs can also deliver tailored outputs using various means such as wireless signals and visuals to drivers, infrastructures, and autonomous vehicles. To evaluate LLMs ability as traffic controllers, this study proposed a four-stage methodology. The methodology includes data creation and environment initialization, prompt engineering, conflict identification, and fine-tuning. We simulated multi-lane four-leg intersection scenarios and generates detailed datasets to enable conflict detection using LLMs and Python simulation as a ground truth. We used chain-of-thought prompts to lead LLMs in understanding the context, detecting conflicts, resolving them using traffic rules, and delivering context-sensitive traffic management solutions. We evaluated the prformance GPT-mini, Gemini, and Llama as traffic controllers. Results showed that the fine-tuned GPT-mini achieved 83% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.84. GPT-mini model exhibited a promising performance in generating actionable traffic management insights, with high ROUGE-L scores across conflict identification of 0.95, decision-making of 0.91, priority assignment of 0.94, and waiting time optimization of 0.92. We demonstrated that LLMs can offer precise recommendations to drivers in real-time including yielding, slowing, or stopping based on vehicle dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is a crucial component in urban traffic management, aiming to optimize road network efficiency and reduce congestion. Traditional TSC methods, primarily based on transportation engineering and reinforcement learning (RL), often struggle with generalization abilities across varied traffic scenarios and lack interpretability. This paper presents LLMLight, a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision-making agents for TSC. Specifically, the framework begins by instructing the LLM with a knowledgeable prompt detailing real-time traffic conditions. Leveraging the advanced generalization capabilities of LLMs, LLMLight engages a reasoning and decision-making process akin to human intuition for effective traffic control. Moreover, we build LightGPT, a specialized backbone LLM tailored for TSC tasks. By learning nuanced traffic patterns and control strategies, LightGPT enhances the LLMLight framework cost-effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-world and synthetic datasets, along with evaluations by fifteen human experts, demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness, generalization ability, and interpretability of LLMLight with LightGPT, outperforming nine baseline methods and ten advanced LLMs.",
