    "abstract": "Emergency response management (ERM) is a challenge faced by communities across the globe. First responders must respond to various incidents, such as fires, traffic accidents, and medical emergencies. They must respond quickly to incidents to minimize the risk to human life. Consequently, considerable attention has been devoted to studying emergency incidents and response in the last several decades. In particular, data-driven models help reduce human and financial loss and improve design codes, traffic regulations, and safety measures. This tutorial paper explores four sub-problems within emergency response: incident prediction, incident detection, resource allocation, and resource dispatch. We aim to present mathematical formulations for these problems and broad frameworks for each problem. We also share open-source (synthetic) data from a large metropolitan area in the USA for future work on data-driven emergency response.",

    "title": "An Emergency Disposal Decision-making Method with Human-Machine Collaboration",
    "published_date": "2023-05-29",
    "abstract": "Rapid developments in artificial intelligence technology have led to unmanned systems replacing human beings in many fields requiring high-precision predictions and decisions. In modern operational environments, all job plans are affected by emergency events such as equipment failures and resource shortages, making a quick resolution critical. The use of unmanned systems to assist decision-making can improve resolution efficiency, but their decision-making is not interpretable and may make the wrong decisions. Current unmanned systems require human supervision and control. Based on this, we propose a collaborative human--machine method for resolving unplanned events using two phases: task filtering and task scheduling. In the task filtering phase, we propose a human--machine collaborative decision-making algorithm for dynamic tasks. The GACRNN model is used to predict the state of the job nodes, locate the key nodes, and generate a machine-predicted resolution task list. A human decision-maker supervises the list in real time and modifies and confirms the machine-predicted list through the human--machine interface. In the task scheduling phase, we propose a scheduling algorithm that integrates human experience constraints. The steps to resolve an event are inserted into the normal job sequence to schedule the resolution. We propose several human--machine collaboration methods in each phase to generate steps to resolve an unplanned event while minimizing the impact on the original job plan.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a two-phase human-machine collaborative method for resolving emergency events in operational environments, using a GACRNN model for initial task prediction and a human-in-the-loop system for refinement and scheduling to minimize disruption to planned operations. The method combines AI-driven task prioritization with human expertise to ensure reliable and interpretable decision-making."

    "abstract": "Emergency medicine and its services have reached a breaking point during the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic has highlighted the failures of a system that needs to be reconsidered, and novel approaches need to be considered. Artificial intelligence (AI) has matured to the point where it is poised to fundamentally transform health care, and applications within the emergency field are particularly promising. In this viewpoint, we first attempt to depict the landscape of AI-based applications currently in use in the daily emergency field. We review the existing AI systems; their algorithms; and their derivation, validation, and impact studies. We also propose future directions and perspectives. Second, we examine the ethics and risk specificities of the use of AI in the emergency field.",

    "published_date": "2021-09-10",
    "abstract": "Emergency personnel respond to various situations ranging from fire, medical, hazardous materials, industrial accidents, to natural disasters. Situations such as natural disasters or terrorist acts require a multifaceted response of firefighters, paramedics, hazmat teams, and other agencies. Engineering AI systems that aid emergency personnel proves to be a difficult system engineering problem. Mission-critical\"edge AI\"situations require low-latency, reliable analytics. To further add complexity, a high degree of model accuracy is required when lives are at stake, creating a need for the deployment of highly accurate, however computationally intensive models to resource-constrained devices. To address all these issues, we propose an agent-based architecture for deployment of AI agents via 5G service-based architecture.",

    "title": "On Algorithmic Decision Procedures in Emergency Response Systems in Smart and Connected Communities",
    "published_date": "2020-01-21",
    "abstract": "Emergency Response Management (ERM) is a critical problem faced by communities across the globe. Despite this, it is common for ERM systems to follow myopic decision policies in the real world. Principled approaches to aid ERM decision-making under uncertainty have been explored but have failed to be accepted into real systems. We identify a key issue impeding their adoption --- algorithmic approaches to emergency response focus on reactive, post-incident dispatching actions, i.e. optimally dispatching a responder \\textit{after} incidents occur. However, the critical nature of emergency response dictates that when an incident occurs, first responders always dispatch the closest available responder to the incident. We argue that the crucial period of planning for ERM systems is not post-incident, but between incidents. This is not a trivial planning problem --- a major challenge with dynamically balancing the spatial distribution of responders is the complexity of the problem. An orthogonal problem in ERM systems is planning under limited communication, which is particularly important in disaster scenarios that affect communication networks. We address both problems by proposing two partially decentralized multi-agent planning algorithms that utilize heuristics and exploit the structure of the dispatch problem. We evaluate our proposed approach using real-world data, and find that in several contexts, dynamic re-balancing the spatial distribution of emergency responders reduces both the average response time as well as its variance.",

    "summary": "This paper argues that improving emergency response systems requires proactive, inter-incident planning rather than solely reactive post-incident dispatching. It proposes two decentralized multi-agent algorithms to dynamically rebalance responder locations, demonstrating improved response times and reduced variance through real-world data evaluation."

    "published_date": "2020-12-24",
    "abstract": "A classical problem in city-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS) is resource allocation under uncertainty. Typically, such problems are modeled as Markov (or semi-Markov) decision processes. While online, offline, and decentralized approaches have been applied to such problems, they have difficulty scaling to large decision problems. We present a general approach to hierarchical planning that leverages structure in city-level CPS problems for resource allocation under uncertainty. We use emergency response as a case study and show how a large resource allocation problem can be split into smaller problems. We then create a principled framework for solving the smaller problems and tackling the interaction between them. Finally, we use real-world data from Nashville, Tennessee, a major metropolitan area in the United States, to validate our approach. Our experiments show that the proposed approach out-performs state-of-the-art approaches used in the field of emergency response.",

    "published_date": "2020-10-15",
    "abstract": "Emergency response to incidents such as accidents, crimes, and fires is a major problem faced by communities. Emergency response management comprises of several stages and sub-problems like forecasting, resource allocation, and dispatch. The design of principled approaches to tackle each problem is necessary to create efficient emergency response management (ERM) pipelines. Over the last six years, we have worked with several first responder organizations to design ERM pipelines. In this paper, we highlight some of the challenges that we have identified and lessons that we have learned through our experience in this domain. Such challenges are particularly relevant for practitioners and researchers, and are important considerations even in the design of response strategies to mitigate disasters like floods and earthquakes.",
