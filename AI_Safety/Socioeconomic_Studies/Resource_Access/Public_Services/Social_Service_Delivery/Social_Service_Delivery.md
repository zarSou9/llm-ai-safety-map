### Mini Description

Examination of how AI affects the distribution and administration of social benefits, welfare programs, and community services

### Description

Social Service Delivery examines how AI systems transform the administration, targeting, and distribution of social welfare programs and community support services. This includes studying the implementation of AI in eligibility determination, needs assessment, benefit calculation, case management, and program evaluation. The research focuses on balancing the potential efficiency gains from automation with concerns about algorithmic bias, privacy, and maintaining human dignity in service delivery.

A core challenge is developing AI systems that can accurately assess complex social needs while accounting for contextual factors and individual circumstances that may not be readily quantifiable. This involves investigating how different modeling approaches and data collection methods affect service allocation decisions, particularly for vulnerable populations who may have non-standard situations or limited digital footprints. Researchers also examine how AI-driven systems influence caseworker decision-making, client-provider relationships, and the overall quality of service provision.

The field emphasizes understanding how AI deployment in social services affects different demographic groups and communities. This includes studying variations in service accessibility, analyzing the impact of digital literacy requirements, and developing frameworks for measuring equity in automated service delivery. Particular attention is paid to ensuring that AI systems enhance rather than replace human judgment in sensitive cases, while also investigating how automation can reduce administrative burdens and improve service consistency.
