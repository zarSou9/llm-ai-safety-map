    "published_date": "2024-07-28",
    "abstract": "In an era of digital governance, the use of automation for individual and cooperative work is increasing in public administrations (Tangi et al., 2022). Despite the promises of efficiency and cost reduction, automation could bring new challenges to the governance schemes. Regional, national, and local governments are taking measures to regulate and measure the impact of automated decision-making systems (ADMS). This research focuses on the use and adoption of ADMS in European public administrations to understand how these systems have been transforming the roles, tasks, and duties of street-level bureaucrats. We conducted a qualitative study in which we interviewed street-level bureaucrats from three administrations who had used an ADMS for several years, which was embedded in their daily work routines. The outcome of our research is an analysis of five dimensions of how collaborative work, the organizational settings, the capacities of bureaucrats and the implementation of the ADMS enable or limit the capacities for offering better services towards the citizens.",
    "summary": "This qualitative study examines how automated decision-making systems (ADMS) impact street-level bureaucrats in European public administrations, analyzing five dimensions—collaboration, organizational settings, bureaucrat capacity, ADMS implementation, and service delivery—to understand their influence on service quality."

    "title": "Generative AI is already widespread in the public sector",
    "published_date": "2024-01-02",
    "abstract": "Generative AI has the potential to transform how public services are delivered by enhancing productivity and reducing time spent on bureaucracy. But to what extent is the technology already in use? Our survey of UK public service professionals (in education, health, social work, and emergency services) seeks to answer this question. We find that use of generative AI is widespread: 45% of respondents were aware of colleagues using generative AI, while 22% use it themselves. Respondents were positive about its potential to enhance their efficiency and reduce their bureaucratic workload. For example, those working in the health service thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop by the equivalent of one day per week, an enormous potential impact. Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61%) in generative AI and a low fear of replacement (16%). However, only a minority of respondents (32%) felt like there was clear guidance on generative AI usage in their workplaces. In other words, it is clear that generative AI is already coming into the public sector, but uptake is happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines. The UK's public sector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage of the technology.",

    "summary": "A survey of UK public sector employees reveals widespread, albeit disorganized, adoption of generative AI, with significant potential for efficiency gains but a lack of clear organizational guidance. Positive user perceptions contrast with the absence of systematic implementation strategies."

    "title": "What Leads to Administrative Bloat? A Dynamic Model of Administrative Cost and Waste",
    "published_date": "2024-12-19",
    "abstract": "We formulate a quantitative, dynamic model that captures how environmental change, alignment with the environment, managerial decisions, and resource constraints interact to give rise to administrative bloat in organizations, resulting in organizational failure. Inspired by empirical findings, we model codified processes that, while initially useful, become obsolete as conditions change, consuming resources until actively removed. Our model predicts a critical threshold in management decision parameters -- the propensity to create processes in response to problems, and the propensity to prune obsolete processes in response to administrative burden. This threshold determines two possible outcomes: a sustainable equilibrium, where administrative costs stabilize below resource limits, and runaway administrative bloat, where costs -- dominated by obsolete processes -- grow to resource capacity. The threshold worsens with faster environmental changes. A short-term environmental shock exceeding a critical threshold can push organizations from sustainability into bloat cycles, highlighting the risks posed by events like technological upheaval. Importantly, process creation and pruning propensities have asymmetrical impacts on outcomes. Avoiding administrative bloat requires carefully balancing codified and ad-hoc solutions, weighing error costs, and anticipating future process obsolescence. Finally, We also discuss how our model may be applied to generate insight from existing and future data.",
    "summary": "A dynamic model demonstrates that organizational administrative bloat arises from an imbalance between creating and removing codified processes in response to environmental changes and resource constraints, leading to either a sustainable equilibrium or runaway growth exceeding resource capacity. This threshold is influenced by the speed of environmental change and the propensities for process creation and pruning, with asymmetrical impacts favoring careful process management to avoid bloat."

Many actions focus on talent acquisition, responsible AI use, and addressing potential biases in AI systems."

    "title": "A Trust Framework for Government Use of Artificial Intelligence and Automated Decision Making",
    "published_date": "2022-08-22",
    "abstract": "This paper identifies the current challenges of the mechanisation, digitisation and automation of public sector systems and processes, and proposes a modern and practical framework to ensure and assure ethical and high veracity Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Automated Decision Making (ADM) systems in public institutions. This framework is designed for the specific context of the public sector, in the jurisdictional and constitutional context of Australia, but is extendable to other jurisdictions and private sectors. The goals of the framework are to: 1) earn public trust and grow public confidence in government systems; 2) to ensure the unique responsibilities and accountabilities (including to the public) of public institutions under Administrative Law are met effectively; and 3) to assure a positive human, societal and ethical impact from the adoption of such systems. The framework could be extended to assure positive environmental or other impacts, but this paper focuses on human/societal outcomes and public trust. This paper is meant to complement principles-based frameworks like Australia's Artificial Intelligence Ethics Framework and the EU Assessment List for Trustworthy AI. In many countries, COVID created a bubble of improved trust, a bubble which has arguably already popped, and in an era of unprecedented mistrust of public institutions (but even in times of high trust) it is not enough that a service is faster, or more cost-effective. This paper proposes recommendations for government systems (technology platforms, operations, culture, governance, engagement, etc.) that would help to improve public confidence and trust in public institutions, policies and services, whilst meeting the special obligations and responsibilities of the public sector.",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a trust framework for ethical and reliable government use of AI and automated decision-making in Australia, aiming to build public confidence and ensure compliance with public sector responsibilities while addressing current societal mistrust. The framework complements existing principles-based approaches and focuses on human and societal impacts."
