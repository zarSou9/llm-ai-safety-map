### Mini Description

Investigation of cognitive and educational barriers, including digital literacy, AI literacy, and the specialized knowledge required to effectively utilize AI-enhanced services

### Description

Knowledge and skills barriers in AI access represent the cognitive and educational requirements that can prevent individuals from effectively utilizing AI-enhanced services and technologies. This encompasses both fundamental capabilities like digital literacy and specialized knowledge needed to understand, interact with, and derive value from AI systems. The complexity of these barriers increases as AI systems become more sophisticated, requiring users to understand not just interface mechanics but also conceptual frameworks around AI capabilities, limitations, and appropriate use cases.

A key challenge in this domain is the rapid evolution of required knowledge and skills, as AI technology advances faster than educational systems can adapt. This creates a dynamic landscape where the definition of 'AI literacy' constantly shifts, making it difficult to establish stable educational frameworks or standardized competency metrics. Researchers focus on identifying core competencies that remain relevant despite technological change, while also developing adaptive learning approaches that can keep pace with evolving requirements.

The field emphasizes understanding how different knowledge and skill requirements interact with various learning contexts and individual capabilities. This includes studying how prior experience, educational background, and cognitive styles influence the acquisition of AI-related skills. Particular attention is paid to developing inclusive learning frameworks that accommodate diverse learning needs and backgrounds, while also addressing the metacognitive skills needed for continuous adaptation to new AI capabilities.
