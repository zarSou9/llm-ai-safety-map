    "title": "Connectivity for AI enabled cities -- A field survey based study of emerging economies",
    "published_date": "2025-01-16",
    "abstract": "The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various aspects of urban life, including, governance, policy and planning, healthcare, sustainability, economics, entrepreneurship, etc. Although AI immense potential for positively impacting urban living, its success depends on overcoming significant challenges, particularly in telecommunications infrastructure. Smart city applications, such as, federated learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and online financial services, require reliable Quality of Service (QoS) from telecommunications networks to ensure effective information transfer. However, with over three billion people underserved or lacking access to internet, many of these AI-driven applications are at risk of either remaining underutilized or failing altogether. Furthermore, many IoT and video-based applications in densely populated urban areas require high-quality connectivity. This paper explores these issues, focusing on the challenges that need to be mitigated to make AI succeed in emerging countries, where more than 80% of the world population resides and urban migration grows. In this context, an overview of a case study conducted in Kathmandu, Nepal, highlights citizens' aspirations for affordable, high-quality internet-based services. The findings underscore the pressing need for advanced telecommunication networks to meet diverse user requirements while addressing investment and infrastructure gaps. This discussion provides insights into bridging the digital divide and enabling AI's transformative potential in urban areas.",
    "summary": "This paper investigates the crucial role of robust telecommunications infrastructure in realizing the potential of AI-driven smart cities, particularly in emerging economies, highlighting connectivity challenges and the need for improved infrastructure to bridge the digital divide. A case study in Kathmandu, Nepal, underscores the urgent need for affordable, high-quality internet access to support AI applications and meet citizens' aspirations."

    "title": "Learning to Adopt Generative AI",
    "published_date": "2024-10-17",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in generative AI, exemplified by ChatGPT, have dramatically transformed how people access information. Despite its powerful capabilities, the benefits it provides may not be equally distributed among individuals - a phenomenon referred to as the digital divide. Building upon prior literature, we propose two forms of digital divide in the generative AI adoption process: (i) the learning divide, capturing individuals' heterogeneous abilities to update their perceived utility of ChatGPT; and (ii) the utility divide, representing differences in individuals' actual utility derived from per use of ChatGPT. To evaluate these two divides, we develop a Bayesian learning model that incorporates demographic heterogeneities in both the utility and signal functions. Leveraging a six-month clickstream dataset, we estimate the model and find significant learning and utility divides across various demographic attributes. Interestingly, lower-educated and non-white individuals derive higher utility gains from ChatGPT but learn about its utility at a slower rate. Furthermore, males, younger individuals, and those with an IT background not only derive higher utility per use from ChatGPT but also learn about its utility more rapidly. Besides, we document a phenomenon termed the belief trap, wherein users underestimate ChatGPT's utility, opt not to use the tool, and consequently lack new experiences to update their perceptions, leading to continued underutilization. Our simulation further demonstrates that the learning divide can significantly affect the probability of falling into the belief trap, another form of the digital divide in adoption outcomes (i.e., outcome divide); however, offering training programs can alleviate the belief trap and mitigate the divide.",
    "summary": "The study identifies a \"learning divide\" and a \"utility divide\" in generative AI adoption, showing that while some demographic groups (e.g., lower-educated, non-white individuals) gain higher utility from ChatGPT, they learn its value slower, creating a \"belief trap\" that hinders usage; targeted training can mitigate this disparity."

    "published_date": "2024-01-12",
    "abstract": "We examine ProcessGPT, an AI model designed to automate, augment, and improve business processes, to study the challenges of managing business processes within the cognitive limitations of the human workforce, particularly individuals with cognitive disabilities. ProcessGPT provides a blueprint for designing efficient business processes that take into account human cognitive limitations. By viewing this through the lens of cognitive disabilities, we show that ProcessGPT improves process usability for individuals with and without cognitive disabilities. We also demonstrate that organizations implementing ProcessGPT-like capabilities will realize increased productivity, morale, and inclusion.",
    "summary": "ProcessGPT, an AI-powered business process automation tool, addresses cognitive limitations in the workforce by designing more usable processes, benefiting employees with and without cognitive disabilities and improving overall organizational productivity and inclusion. The study demonstrates that this approach increases efficiency and equalizes access to work."

    "published_date": "2024-02-20",
    "abstract": "Increasing diversity in educational settings is challenging in part due to the lack of access to resources for non-traditional learners in remote communities. Post-pandemic platforms designed specifically for remote and hybrid learning---supporting team-based collaboration online---are positioned to bridge this gap. Our work combines the use of these new platforms with co-creation and collaboration tools for AI assisted remote Work-Integrated-Learning (WIL) opportunities, including efforts in community and with the public library system. This paper outlines some of our experiences to date, and proposes methods to further integrate AI education into community-driven applications for remote WIL.",
    "summary": "This paper explores using post-pandemic online platforms and AI tools to expand access to Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) opportunities for remote learners, focusing on collaborative projects within their communities.

    "title": "The Emerging AI Divide in the United States",
    "published_date": "2024-04-18",
    "abstract": "The digital divide describes disparities in access to and usage of digital tooling between social and economic groups. Emerging generative artificial intelligence tools, which strongly affect productivity, could magnify the impact of these divides. However, the affordability, multi-modality, and multilingual capabilities of these tools could also make them more accessible to diverse users in comparison with previous forms of digital tooling. In this study, we characterize spatial differences in U.S. residents' knowledge of a new generative AI tool, ChatGPT, through an analysis of state- and county-level search query data. In the first six months after the tool's release, we observe the highest rates of users searching for ChatGPT in West Coast states and persistently low rates of search in Appalachian and Gulf states. Counties with the highest rates of search are relatively more urbanized and have proportionally more educated, more economically advantaged, and more Asian residents in comparison with other counties or with the U.S. average. In multilevel models adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as industry makeup, education is the strongest positive predictor of rates of search for generative AI tooling. Although generative AI technologies may be novel, early differences in uptake appear to be following familiar paths of digital marginalization.",
    "citation_count": 4,
    "summary": "Analysis of ChatGPT search data reveals a widening AI divide in the US, with higher search rates in wealthier, more educated, and urban areas, mirroring existing digital inequalities rather than bridging them. This suggests that accessibility to and adoption of generative AI tools may exacerbate existing socioeconomic disparities."
