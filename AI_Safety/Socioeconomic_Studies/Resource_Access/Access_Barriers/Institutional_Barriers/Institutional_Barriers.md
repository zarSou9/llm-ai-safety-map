### Mini Description

Study of organizational, regulatory, and policy-related obstacles that restrict access to AI resources, including bureaucratic procedures, legal restrictions, and institutional biases

### Description

Institutional barriers in AI resource access encompass the systematic obstacles created by organizational structures, policies, regulations, and established practices that limit or prevent certain groups from accessing AI-enhanced services and resources. These barriers often manifest through complex interactions between formal rules, informal practices, and organizational cultures that can inadvertently or deliberately exclude particular populations. Understanding these barriers requires examining how institutions' decision-making processes, resource allocation mechanisms, and operational procedures affect access to AI technologies and services.

A key challenge in this domain is identifying how institutional barriers intersect with and amplify other forms of exclusion. This includes studying how organizational policies might disproportionately affect marginalized communities, how regulatory frameworks may inadvertently create access disparities, and how institutional decision-making processes might perpetuate existing biases. Researchers focus on mapping the networks of institutional relationships and power dynamics that shape access to AI resources, including the role of intermediary organizations, gatekeepers, and policy enforcement mechanisms.

The field emphasizes developing frameworks for evaluating institutional barrier impacts and designing interventions that can effectively address them at systemic levels. This involves analyzing how different institutional arrangements affect access patterns, identifying leverage points for policy reform, and developing strategies for institutional transformation. Particular attention is paid to the role of legacy systems, institutional inertia, and resistance to change in maintaining access barriers, as well as the potential for institutional innovation to create more inclusive access frameworks.
