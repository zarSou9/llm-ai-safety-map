    "title": "Development of a Causal Model for Improving Rural Seniors' Accessibility: Data Evidences",
    "published_date": "2024-01-23",
    "abstract": "Seniors residing in rural areas often encounter limited accessibility to opportunities, resources, and services. This paper introduces a model proposing that both aging and rural residency are factors contributing to the restricted accessibility faced by rural seniors. Leveraging data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, the study examines three hypotheses pertaining to this causal model. Multiple causal pathways emerge in the data analysis, with mobility identified as a mediator in one of them. The study further identifies specific challenges faced by rural seniors, such as the reduced accessibility in reaching medical services and assisting others. These challenges stem primarily from aging and geographic obstacles that not only diminish their willingness to travel but also restrict more in the group from choosing transportation modes with higher mobility. The insights gained from this study serve as a foundation for devising effective methods to enhance transportation accessibility for seniors in rural areas.",
    "summary": "This study uses 2017 National Household Travel Survey data to develop a causal model explaining reduced accessibility for rural seniors, finding that aging and rural residency, impacting mobility, contribute to limited access to services, particularly healthcare. The findings inform strategies to improve transportation accessibility for this population."

    "title": "Cultural influence on RE activities: An extended analysis of state of the art",
    "published_date": "2024-07-24",
    "abstract": "Designing mobile software that aligns with cultural contexts is crucial for optimizing human-computer interaction. Considering cultural influences is essential not only for the actual set of functional/non-functional requirements, but also for the whole Requirement Engineering (RE) process. Without a clear understanding of cultural influences on RE activities, it's hardly possible to elaborate a correct and complete set of requirements. This research explores the impact of national culture on RE-related activities based on recent studies. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of studies published in 2019-2023 and compared them to an older SLR covering 2000-2018. We identified 17 relevant studies, extracted 33 cultural influences impacting RE activities, and mapped them to the Hofstede model, widely used for cultural analysis in software development research. Our work highlights the critical role of national culture in RE activities, summarizes current research trends, and helps practitioners consider cultural influences for mobile app/software development.",
    "summary": "This systematic literature review analyzes the impact of national culture on requirement engineering (RE) activities for mobile software development, revealing 33 cultural influences mapped to Hofstede's cultural dimensions and highlighting the crucial role of cultural awareness in successful software development."

    "title": "Complementarity in Demand-side Variables and Educational Participation",
    "published_date": "2023-02-20",
    "abstract": "Decision to participate in education depends on the circumstances individual inherits and on the returns to education she expects as well. If one person from any socio-economically disadvantaged social group inherits poor circumstances measured in terms of family background, then she is having poor opportunities vis-\\`a-vis her capability set becomes confined. Accordingly, her freedom to choose the best alternative from many is also less, and she fails to expect the potential returns from educational participation. Consequently, a complementary relationship between the circumstances one inherits and the returns to education she expects can be observed. This paper is an attempt to look at this complementarity on the basis of theoretical logic and empirical investigation, which enables us to unearth the origin of inter-group disparity in educational participation, as is existed across the groups defined by taking caste and gender together in Indian society. Furthermore, in the second piece of analysis, we assess the discrimination in the likelihood of educational participation by invoking the method of decomposition of disparity in the likelihood of educational participation applicable in the logistic regression models, which enables us to re-establish the earlier mentioned complementary relationship.",
    "summary": "This paper investigates the complementary relationship between inherited circumstances (socioeconomic background) and expected returns to education in influencing educational participation, focusing on caste and gender disparities in India. Empirical analysis using logistic regression confirms this complementarity and helps explain inter-group differences in educational attainment."

    "title": "The Influence of Cultural Distance on Settlement Intention of Floating Population in China",
    "published_date": "2022-11-08",
    "abstract": "Based on a nationwide labour-force survey data, this paper investigates the influence of cultural variance on migrants' settlement intention in China. By using dialectal distance as a proxy for cultural distance, we find strong evidence for the negative effects of cultural distance on migrants' settlement intention. By further investigation into sub-samples separated by gender, generation and higher education experience, we find that the influence is less effective for younger migrants and higher-educated migrants, which indicates that the impact of cultural barrier may gradually diminish with the integration of society and promotion of education.",

    "summary": "This study uses dialectal distance to measure the impact of cultural differences on Chinese migrant settlement intentions, finding that greater cultural distance negatively correlates with settlement desire, although this effect is weaker among younger and more highly educated migrants."

    "title": "Digital Divide: Mapping the geodemographics of internet accessibility across Great Britain",
    "published_date": "2021-08-03",
    "abstract": "Aim: This research proposes the first solely sociodemographic measure of digital accessibility for Great Britain. Digital inaccessibility affects circa 10 million people who are unable to access or make full use of the internet, particularly impacting the disadvantaged in society. Method: A geodemographic classification is developed, analysing literature-guided sociodemographic variables at the district level. Analysis: Resultant clusters are analysed against their sociodemographic variables and spatial extent. Findings suggest three at-risk clusters exist,\"Metropolitan Minority Struggle\",\"Indian Metropolitan Living\"and\"Pakistani-Bangladeshi Inequality\". These are validated through nationwide Ofcom telecommunications performance data and specific case studies using Office for National Statistics internet usage data. Conclusion: Using solely contemporary and open-source sociodemographic variables, this paper enhances previous digital accessibility research. The identification of digitally inaccessible areas allows focussed local and national government resource and policy targeting, particularly important as a key data source and methodology post-2021, following the expected final nationwide census.",

    "summary": "This study creates a sociodemographic model identifying three digitally inaccessible clusters in Great Britain—\"Metropolitan Minority Struggle,\" \"Indian Metropolitan Living,\" and \"Pakistani-Bangladeshi Inequality\"—using open-source data, enabling targeted policy interventions. The findings are validated using telecommunications and internet usage data."

    "title": "Toward an Actionable Socioeconomic-Aware HCI",
    "published_date": "2021-08-30",
    "abstract": "Although inequities for individuals in different socioeconomic situations are starting to capture widespread attention, less attention has been given to the socioeconomic inequities that saturate socioeconomic-diverse individuals' user experiences. To enable HCI practitioners to attend to such inequities and avoid unwittingly introducing them, in this paper we consider a wide body of research relevant to how an individual's socioeconomic status (SES) can affect their user experiences with technology. We synthesize this foundational research to produce a core set of 6 evidence-based SES\"facets\"(attribute types and value ranges) that directly relate to user experiences for individuals in different SES strata. We then harness these SES facets to produce actionable paths forward -- including a new structured method we call SocioeconomicMag -- by which HCI researchers and practitioners can bring new socioeconomic-aware practices into their everyday HCI work.",

    "summary": "This paper synthesizes research on how socioeconomic status (SES) impacts user experiences with technology, identifying six key SES facets affecting user interactions. It then proposes SocioeconomicMag, a structured method to integrate socioeconomic awareness into HCI research and practice, mitigating the unintentional introduction of inequities."

    "title": "Of Access and Inclusivity Digital Divide in Online Education",
    "published_date": "2021-07-22",
    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has thrown the educational system of the country in disarray. The closure of schools and colleges began before the completion of the end-semester or annual exams and cast a blight on the entire academic cycle. A reinforcing web of issues, such as prolonged closure, uncertainty about the timing of reopening, likely constriction in the academic calendar and the resultant learning discontinuity among students, among others, has forced the states and educational institutions to find a feasible option to assuage the varied impacts. Online education has emerged as a preferred, predominant option. In fact, it has been pontificated to the status of TINA—there is no alternative to it. On the face of it, online education appears as a safe interim bet. Yet, its scale, scope and reach raise serious issues, both on the process preceding it and the outcome proceeding from it.",
    "citation_count": 10,
    "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid shift to online education, but this transition exposed a significant digital divide, highlighting inequalities in access and impacting educational outcomes. The paper explores the challenges and consequences of this shift."

    "published_date": "2021-04-06",
    "summary": "The standard epidemiological model poorly predicts COVID-19 infection rates across US states, failing to explain the surprisingly similar infection levels despite varying policies and behaviors. A proposed \"vulnerability model,\" which incorporates fluctuating individual susceptibility to infection over time, better accounts for the observed data and resolves inconsistencies of the standard model."
