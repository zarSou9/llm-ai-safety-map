### Mini Description

Study of financial barriers to accessing AI resources, including direct costs, indirect expenses, and opportunity costs associated with AI system adoption and use

### Description

Economic constraints in AI access encompass the financial barriers that prevent individuals, organizations, and communities from fully participating in and benefiting from AI-enhanced technologies and services. These constraints operate at multiple levels, from direct costs like subscription fees and hardware requirements to indirect expenses such as training, maintenance, and necessary infrastructure upgrades. The interaction between these different cost factors creates complex accessibility patterns that often reinforce existing economic disparities.

Research in this area focuses on quantifying both obvious and hidden economic barriers, analyzing how they affect different socioeconomic groups, and developing frameworks for evaluating the total cost of meaningful AI access. This includes studying how initial investment requirements, ongoing operational costs, and opportunity costs combine to influence adoption decisions. Particular attention is paid to how economic barriers interact with market dynamics, such as how pricing models, competition, and economies of scale affect accessibility.

A key challenge is developing sustainable solutions that can reduce economic barriers without compromising the quality or sustainability of AI services. This involves exploring various financing models, subsidization approaches, and cost-sharing mechanisms that could make AI more accessible while ensuring continued innovation and development. Researchers also examine how economic constraints might evolve as AI technology advances, including potential feedback loops where limited access leads to reduced economic opportunities, further reinforcing access barriers.
