    "title": "GAEA: Graph Augmentation for Equitable Access via Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2020-12-07",
    "abstract": "Disparate access to resources by different subpopulations is a prevalent issue in societal and sociotechnical networks. For example, urban infrastructure networks may enable certain racial groups to more easily access resources such as high-quality schools, grocery stores, and polling places. Similarly, social networks within universities and organizations may enable certain groups to more easily access people with valuable information or influence. Here we introduce a new class of problems, Graph Augmentation for Equitable Access (GAEA), to enhance equity in networked systems by editing graph edges under budget constraints. We prove such problems are NP-hard, and cannot be approximated within a factor of (1-1/3e). We develop a principled, sample- and time- efficient Markov Reward Process (MRP)-based mechanism design framework for GAEA. Our algorithm outperforms baselines on a diverse set of synthetic graphs. We further demonstrate the method on real-world networks, by merging public census, school, and transportation datasets for the city of Chicago and applying our algorithm to find human-interpretable edits to the bus network that enhance equitable access to high-quality schools across racial groups. Further experiments on Facebook networks of universities yield sets of new social connections that would increase equitable access to certain attributed nodes across gender groups.",

    "summary": "GAEA addresses equitable access disparities in networks by formulating the problem of budget-constrained graph edge editing to improve resource access for disadvantaged groups as an NP-hard problem. A novel reinforcement learning approach is proposed and evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets (Chicago bus network and university Facebook networks), demonstrating improved equitable access."

    "title": "AccessShare: Co-designing Data Access and Sharing with Blind People",
    "published_date": "2024-07-27",
    "abstract": "Blind people are often called to contribute image data to datasets for AI innovation with the hope for future accessibility and inclusion. Yet, the visual inspection of the contributed images is inaccessible. To this day, we lack mechanisms for data inspection and control that are accessible to the blind community. To address this gap, we engage 10 blind participants in a scenario where they wear smartglasses and collect image data using an AI-infused application in their homes. We also engineer a design probe, a novel data access interface called AccessShare, and conduct a co-design study to discuss participants' needs, preferences, and ideas on consent, data inspection, and control. Our findings reveal the impact of interactive informed consent and the complementary role of data inspection systems such as AccessShare in facilitating communication between data stewards and blind data contributors. We discuss how key insights can guide future informed consent and data control to promote inclusive and responsible data practices in AI.",
    "summary": "AccessShare is a co-designed data access interface enabling blind individuals to inspect and control their image data contributed to AI projects, addressing the accessibility gap in current data donation practices. The study highlights the importance of interactive informed consent and accessible data inspection tools for fostering inclusive and responsible AI development."

    "title": "Resource-constrained Fairness",
    "published_date": "2024-06-03",
    "abstract": "Access to resources strongly constrains the decisions we make. While we might wish to offer every student a scholarship, or schedule every patient for follow-up meetings with a specialist, limited resources mean that this is not possible. When deploying machine learning systems, these resource constraints are simply enforced by varying the threshold of a classifier. However, these finite resource limitations are disregarded by most existing tools for fair machine learning, which do not allow the specification of resource limitations and do not remain fair when varying thresholds. This makes them ill-suited for real-world deployment. Our research introduces the concept of\"resource-constrained fairness\"and quantifies the cost of fairness within this framework. We demonstrate that the level of available resources significantly influences this cost, a factor overlooked in previous evaluations.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "Existing fair machine learning methods ignore resource constraints, leading to unfair outcomes when thresholds are adjusted to manage limited resources. This paper introduces \"resource-constrained fairness,\" quantifying the cost of fairness under resource limitations and showing how resource availability significantly impacts this cost."

    "title": "AI and the Opportunity for Shared Prosperity: Lessons from the History of Technology and the Economy",
    "published_date": "2024-01-18",
    "abstract": "Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) marks a pivotal moment in human history. It presents the opportunity for machines to learn, adapt, and perform tasks that have the potential to assist people, from everyday activities to their most creative and ambitious projects. It also has the potential to help businesses and organizations harness knowledge, increase productivity, innovate, transform, and power shared prosperity. This tremendous potential raises two fundamental questions: (1) Will AI actually advance national and global economic transformation to benefit society at large? and (2) What issues must we get right to fully realize AI's economic value, expand prosperity and improve lives everywhere? We explore these questions by considering the recent history of technology and innovation as a guide for the likely impact of AI and what we must do to realize its economic potential to benefit society. While we do not presume the future will be entirely like that past, for reasons we will discuss, we do believe prior experience with technological change offers many useful lessons. We conclude that while progress in AI presents a historic opportunity to advance our economic prosperity and future wellbeing, its economic benefits will not come automatically and that AI risks exacerbating existing economic challenges unless we collectively and purposefully act to enable its potential and address its challenges. We suggest a collective policy agenda - involving developers, deployers and users of AI, infrastructure providers, policymakers, and those involved in workforce training - that may help both realize and harness AI's economic potential and address its risks to our shared prosperity.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "The paper argues that AI's potential for shared prosperity is significant but not guaranteed, requiring proactive policies addressing both its benefits and risks to avoid exacerbating existing economic inequalities. Lessons from past technological advancements highlight the need for a collaborative approach involving various stakeholders to harness AI's economic potential."

    "title": "The Emerging AI Divide in the United States",
    "published_date": "2024-04-18",
    "abstract": "The digital divide describes disparities in access to and usage of digital tooling between social and economic groups. Emerging generative artificial intelligence tools, which strongly affect productivity, could magnify the impact of these divides. However, the affordability, multi-modality, and multilingual capabilities of these tools could also make them more accessible to diverse users in comparison with previous forms of digital tooling. In this study, we characterize spatial differences in U.S. residents' knowledge of a new generative AI tool, ChatGPT, through an analysis of state- and county-level search query data. In the first six months after the tool's release, we observe the highest rates of users searching for ChatGPT in West Coast states and persistently low rates of search in Appalachian and Gulf states. Counties with the highest rates of search are relatively more urbanized and have proportionally more educated, more economically advantaged, and more Asian residents in comparison with other counties or with the U.S. average. In multilevel models adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as industry makeup, education is the strongest positive predictor of rates of search for generative AI tooling. Although generative AI technologies may be novel, early differences in uptake appear to be following familiar paths of digital marginalization.",
    "citation_count": 4,
    "summary": "Analysis of ChatGPT search queries reveals a widening AI divide in the US, with higher search rates concentrated in wealthier, more urban, and better-educated areas, suggesting that existing socioeconomic disparities are influencing access to and adoption of generative AI."

    "published_date": "2023-09-20",
    "abstract": "This paper plans to develop an Equitable and Re-sponsible AI framework with enabling techniques and algorithms for the Internet of Energy (IoE), in short, RAI4IoE. The energy sector is going through substantial changes fueled by two key drivers: building a zero-carbon energy sector and the digital transformation of the energy infrastructure. We expect to see the convergence of these two drivers resulting in the IoE, where renewable distributed energy resources (DERs), such as electric cars, storage batteries, wind turbines and photovoltaics (PV), can be connected and integrated for reliable energy distribution by leveraging advanced 5G-6G networks and AI technology. This allows DER owners as prosumers to participate in the energy market and derive economic incentives. DERs are inherently asset-driven and face equitable challenges (i.e., fair, diverse and inclusive). Without equitable access, privileged individuals, groups and organizations can participate and benefit at the cost of disadvantaged groups. The real-time management of DER resources not only brings out the equity problem to the IoE, it also collects highly sensitive location, time, activity dependent data, which requires to be handled responsibly (e.g., privacy, security and safety), for AI-enhanced predictions, optimization and prioritization services, and automated management of flexible resources. The vision of our project is to ensure equitable participation of the community members and responsible use of their data in IoE so that it could reap the benefits of advances in AI to provide safe.. reliable and sustainable energy services.",

    "title": "Quantifying the Benefit of Artificial Intelligence for Scientific Research",
    "published_date": "2023-04-17",
    "abstract": "The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has the potential to change almost every line of work. As AI capabilities continue to improve in accuracy, robustness, and reach, AI may outperform and even replace human experts across many valuable tasks. Despite enormous effort devoted to understanding the impact of AI on labor and the economy and AI's recent successes in accelerating scientific discovery and progress, we lack a systematic understanding of how AI advances may benefit scientific research across disciplines and fields. Here, drawing from the literature on the future of work and the science of science, we develop a measurement framework to estimate both the direct use of AI and the potential benefit of AI in scientific research, applying natural language processing techniques to 74.6 million publications and 7.1 million patents. We find that the use of AI in research is widespread throughout the sciences, growing especially rapidly since 2015, and papers that use AI exhibit a citation premium, more likely to be highly cited both within and outside their disciplines. Moreover, our analysis reveals considerable potential for AI to benefit numerous scientific fields, yet a notable disconnect exists between AI education and its research applications, highlighting a mismatch between the supply of AI expertise and its demand in research. Lastly, we examine demographic disparities in AI's benefits across scientific disciplines and find that disciplines with a higher proportion of women or Black scientists tend to be associated with less benefit, suggesting that AI's growing impact on research may further exacerbate existing inequalities in science. As the connection between AI and scientific research deepens, our findings may become increasingly important, with implications for the equity and sustainability of the research enterprise.",
