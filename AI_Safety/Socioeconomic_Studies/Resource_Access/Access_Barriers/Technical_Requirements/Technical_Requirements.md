### Mini Description

Analysis of hardware, software, and infrastructure requirements that may limit access to AI-enhanced services, including device compatibility, bandwidth needs, and computational requirements

### Description

Technical requirements encompass the fundamental technological prerequisites and specifications necessary for individuals and organizations to effectively access and utilize AI-enhanced services. These requirements span across multiple layers of the technology stack, from basic hardware capabilities and network connectivity to specialized software dependencies and computational resources. Understanding these requirements is crucial for identifying potential barriers to access and developing solutions that can make AI services more widely available.

A key challenge in this domain is balancing the increasing computational demands of advanced AI systems with the need for broad accessibility. As AI models grow in complexity and capability, they often require more sophisticated technical infrastructure, which can exclude users with limited resources. This creates a tension between pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities and ensuring these capabilities remain accessible to diverse user groups. Researchers investigate approaches such as model compression, edge computing, and distributed processing to help bridge this gap.

The field also examines how technical requirements evolve over time and vary across different types of AI applications. This includes studying the minimum viable specifications for different use cases, identifying critical bottlenecks in system performance, and developing frameworks for evaluating the technical accessibility of AI services. Particular attention is paid to the interplay between technical requirements and other forms of access barriers, such as how hardware requirements translate into economic costs or how software complexity affects usability.
