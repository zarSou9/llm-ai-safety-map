Investigation of how AI deployment affects healthcare costs, insurance pricing, and coverage decisions

### Description

Cost and Insurance Dynamics examines how AI technologies influence healthcare economics, particularly focusing on the complex interplay between technological advancement, healthcare delivery costs, and insurance market behaviors. This research area investigates both direct effects, such as how AI deployment affects diagnostic and treatment costs, and indirect effects, like changes in risk assessment practices and insurance premium calculations. Key considerations include the economic sustainability of AI healthcare solutions, their impact on different stakeholder groups, and the potential for both cost reduction and new expense categories.

A central challenge is understanding how AI systems affect insurance risk pools and pricing mechanisms. This includes analyzing how AI-driven predictive analytics influence underwriting decisions, how improved diagnostic capabilities affect claims patterns, and how automation in healthcare delivery impacts service pricing. Researchers study both immediate cost implications of AI adoption and longer-term structural changes in healthcare financing models, including potential shifts in responsibility between providers, insurers, and patients.

The field also examines equity implications of AI-driven changes in healthcare financing. This involves studying how AI deployment affects insurance accessibility across different demographic groups, analyzing potential discriminatory effects of AI-based risk assessment, and evaluating policy interventions to ensure fair distribution of both benefits and costs. Particular attention is paid to transition dynamics as healthcare systems integrate AI technologies, including implementation costs, training requirements, and the distribution of efficiency gains among stakeholders.
