### Mini Description

Research on how AI affects patient-provider relationships, health literacy, and individual agency in healthcare decision-making

### Description

Patient Engagement examines how AI technologies influence the dynamics of healthcare interactions, focusing on how individuals understand, participate in, and make decisions about their medical care. This research area investigates the psychological, social, and practical factors that affect patients' ability and willingness to engage with AI-enhanced healthcare systems, including issues of trust, comprehension, and agency. Key considerations include how AI interfaces affect patient autonomy, the role of AI in shared decision-making, and the balance between automated guidance and human judgment.

A central challenge is understanding how AI systems can enhance rather than diminish patient involvement in their healthcare journey. This includes studying how AI-driven tools can effectively communicate complex medical information, support informed consent processes, and maintain meaningful human connections in increasingly automated healthcare environments. Researchers examine how different patient populations interact with AI healthcare interfaces, considering variations in technological literacy, cultural perspectives, and individual preferences for involvement in medical decisions.

The field also explores how AI deployment affects patient-provider relationships and the evolution of healthcare communication patterns. This involves analyzing how AI tools influence trust formation, information sharing, and collaborative decision-making between patients and healthcare providers. Particular attention is paid to ensuring AI systems support rather than replace crucial interpersonal aspects of healthcare delivery, while identifying opportunities where AI can enhance patient understanding and participation in their care process.
