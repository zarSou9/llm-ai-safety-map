### Mini Description

Analysis of how AI transforms healthcare delivery systems, including telemedicine, automated care, and resource allocation mechanisms

### Description

Healthcare Delivery Models research examines how AI technologies transform the fundamental structures and mechanisms through which healthcare services are provided to patients. This includes studying the emergence of new care delivery paradigms enabled by AI, such as automated triage systems, continuous remote monitoring, and predictive intervention models. The field analyzes how these technological capabilities reshape traditional healthcare workflows, provider roles, and patient care pathways.

A key focus is understanding how AI-enabled delivery models affect healthcare quality, accessibility, and efficiency across different settings and populations. This involves evaluating various implementation approaches, from fully automated systems to hybrid human-AI collaborative models, and assessing their impacts on clinical outcomes, resource utilization, and care coordination. Researchers examine how different delivery models perform across various healthcare contexts, from primary care to specialized treatment programs, and how they adapt to different resource constraints and population needs.

The field also investigates the organizational and systemic changes required to effectively implement AI-enabled delivery models. This includes studying how healthcare institutions can successfully transition from traditional to AI-enhanced delivery systems, examining the implications for workforce training and composition, and identifying critical success factors for sustainable implementation. Particular attention is paid to change management strategies, stakeholder alignment, and the development of appropriate quality assurance frameworks for novel delivery approaches.
