    "title": "Quantifying Health Inequalities Induced by Data and AI Models",
    "published_date": "2022-04-24",
    "abstract": "AI technologies are being increasingly tested and applied in critical environments including healthcare. Without an effective way to detect and mitigate AI induced inequalities, AI might do more harm than good, potentially leading to the widening of underlying inequalities. This paper proposes a generic allocation-deterioration framework for detecting and quantifying AI induced inequality. Specifically, AI induced inequalities are quantified as the area between two allocation-deterioration curves. To assess the framework's performance, experiments were conducted on ten synthetic datasets (N>33,000) generated from HiRID - a real-world Intensive Care Unit (ICU) dataset, showing its ability to accurately detect and quantify inequality proportionally to controlled inequalities. Extensive analyses were carried out to quantify health inequalities (a) embedded in two real-world ICU datasets; (b) induced by AI models trained for two resource allocation scenarios. Results showed that compared to men, women had up to 33% poorer deterioration in markers of prognosis when admitted to HiRID ICUs. All four AI models assessed were shown to induce significant inequalities (2.45% to 43.2%) for non-White compared to White patients. The models exacerbated data embedded inequalities significantly in 3 out of 8 assessments, one of which was >9 times worse.",

    "published_date": "2022-04-11",
    "abstract": "Autonomous mobile clinics (AMCs) solve the healthcare access problem by bringing healthcare services to the patient by the order of the patient's fingertips. Nevertheless, to enable a universal AMC network, a three-stage technical roadmap needs to be achieved. In stage one, we focus on solving the inequity challenge in the existing healthcare system by combining autonomous mobility and telemedicine. In stage two, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI) doctor for primary care, which we foster from infancy to adulthood with clean healthcare data. With the AI doctor, we can solve the inefficiency problem. In stage three, after we have proven that the AMC network can truly solve the target clinical use cases, we shall open up the platform for all medical verticals, thus enabling universal healthcare through this whole new system.",

    "title": "New accessibility measures based on unconventional big data sources",
    "published_date": "2024-01-24",
    "abstract": "In health econometric studies we are often interested in quantifying aspects related to the accessibility to medical infrastructures. The increasing availability of data automatically collected through unconventional sources (such as webscraping, crowdsourcing or internet of things) recently opened previously unconceivable opportunities to researchers interested in measuring accessibility and to use it as a tool for real-time monitoring, surveillance and health policies definition. This paper contributes to this strand of literature proposing new accessibility measures that can be continuously feeded by automatic data collection. We present new measures of accessibility and we illustrate their use to study the territorial impact of supply-side shocks of health facilities. We also illustrate the potential of our proposal with a case study based on a huge set of data (related to the Emergency Departments in Milan, Italy) that have been webscraped for the purpose of this paper every 5 minutes since November 2021 to March 2022, amounting to approximately 5 million observations.",

    "published_date": "2024-09-24",
    "abstract": "Mobile health has the potential to revolutionize health care delivery and patient engagement. In this work, we discuss how integrating Artificial Intelligence into digital health applications focused on supply chain operation, patient management, and capacity building, among other use cases, can improve the health system and public health performance. We present the Causal Foundry Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning platform, which allows the delivery of adaptive interventions whose impact can be optimized through experimentation and real-time monitoring. The system can integrate multiple data sources and digital health applications. The flexibility of this platform to connect to various mobile health applications and digital devices, and to send personalized recommendations based on past data and predictions, can significantly improve the impact of digital tools on health system outcomes. The potential for resource-poor settings, where the impact of this approach on health outcomes could be decisive, is discussed. This framework is similarly applicable to improving efficiency in health systems where scarcity is not an issue.",

    "title": "Pursuing Equilibrium of Medical Resources via Data Empowerment in Parallel Healthcare System",
    "published_date": "2023-06-01",
    "abstract": "The imbalance between the supply and demand of healthcare resources is a global challenge, which is particularly severe in developing countries. Governments and academic communities have made various efforts to increase healthcare supply and improve resource allocation. However, these efforts often remain passive and inflexible. Alongside these issues, the emergence of the parallel healthcare system has the potential to solve these problems by unlocking the data value. The parallel healthcare system comprises Medicine-Oriented Operating Systems (MOOS), Medicine-Oriented Scenario Engineering (MOSE), and Medicine-Oriented Large Models (MOLMs), which could collect, circulate, and empower data. In this paper, we propose that achieving equilibrium in medical resource allocation is possible through parallel healthcare systems via data empowerment. The supply-demand relationship can be balanced in parallel healthcare systems by (1) increasing the supply provided by digital and robotic doctors in MOOS, (2) identifying individual and potential demands by proactive diagnosis and treatment in MOSE, and (3) improving supply-demand matching using large models in MOLMs. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present a case study optimizing resource allocation from the perspective of facility accessibility. Results demonstrate that the parallel healthcare system could result in up to 300% improvement in accessibility.",

    "title": "Quantitative and Qualitative evaluation of the recent Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare publications using Deep-Learning",
    "abstract": "Background: An ever increasing number of artificial intelligence (AI) models targeting healthcare applications are developed and published every day, but their use in real world decision making is limited. Beyond a quantitative assessment, it is important to have qualitative evaluation of the maturity of these publications with additional details related to trends in type of data used, type of models developed across the healthcare spectrum. Methods: We assessed the maturity of selected peer-reviewed AI publications pertinent to healthcare for 2019 to 2021. For the report, the data collection was performed by PubMed search using machine learning OR artificial intelligence AND Healthcare with the English language and human subject research as of December 31, each year. All three years selected were manually classified into 34 distinct medical specialties. We used the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) neural networks model to identify the maturity level of research publications based on their abstracts. We further classified a mature publication based on the healthcare specialty and geographical location of the article's senior author. Finally, we manually annotated specific details from mature publications, such as model type, data type, and disease type. Results: Of the 7062 publications relevant to AI in healthcare from 2019 to 2021, 385 were classified as mature. In 2019, 6.01 percent of publications were mature. 7.7 percent were mature in 2020, and 1.81 percent of publications were mature in 2021. Radiology publications had the most mature model publications across all specialties over the last three years, followed by pathology in 2019, ophthalmology in 2020, and gastroenterology in 2021. Geographical pattern analysis revealed a non-uniform distribution pattern. In 2019 and 2020, the United States ranked first with a frequency of 22 and 50, followed by China with 20 and 47. In 2021, China ranked first with 17 mature articles, followed by the United States with 11 mature articles. Imaging based data was the primary source, and deep learning was the most frequently used modeling technique in mature publications. Interpretation: Despite the growing number of publications of AI models in healthcare, only a few publications have been found to be mature with a potentially positive impact on healthcare. Globally, there is an opportunity to leverage diverse datasets and models across the health spectrum, to develop more mature models and related publications, which can fully realize the potential of AI to transform healthcare.",
