### Mini Description

Research on how AI deployment affects access to and requirements for digital resources, including internet connectivity, computing power, and data storage

### Description

Digital Infrastructure research within AI safety examines how artificial intelligence systems both depend on and influence the fundamental technical resources and capabilities required for meaningful participation in an AI-enabled society. This includes studying the distribution and requirements of computational resources, data storage facilities, network connectivity, and the technical literacy needed to effectively utilize AI systems. The field analyzes how these infrastructure requirements create potential barriers to access and investigates approaches to ensure equitable distribution of digital capabilities.

A key focus is understanding how AI deployment affects infrastructure demands and requirements across different scales - from individual devices to organizational systems to national infrastructure. This includes examining how increasing AI capabilities drive changes in hardware requirements, energy consumption patterns, and network bandwidth needs. Researchers study how these evolving requirements interact with existing digital divides and resource constraints, particularly in developing regions or underserved communities.

The field also investigates governance models and technical architectures that could promote more equitable access to digital infrastructure. This includes studying distributed computing approaches, edge computing solutions, and shared resource models that could help democratize access to AI capabilities. Researchers analyze trade-offs between centralized and decentralized infrastructure models, considering factors such as efficiency, reliability, security, and accessibility. Particular attention is paid to sustainability concerns and the environmental impact of expanding digital infrastructure to support AI systems.
