    "title": "AI Adoption to Combat Financial Crime: Study on Natural Language Processing in Adverse Media Screening of Financial Services in English and Bangla multilingual interpretation",
    "published_date": "2024-12-12",
    "abstract": "This document explores the potential of employing Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP), to strengthen the detection and prevention of financial crimes within the Mobile Financial Services(MFS) of Bangladesh with multilingual scenario. The analysis focuses on the utilization of NLP for adverse media screening, a vital aspect of compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and combating financial terrorism (CFT) regulations. Additionally, it investigates the overall reception and obstacles related to the integration of AI in Bangladeshi banks. This report measures the effectiveness of NLP is promising with an accuracy around 94\\%. NLP algorithms display substantial promise in accurately identifying adverse media content linked to financial crimes. The lack of progress in this aspect is visible in Bangladesh, whereas globally the technology is already being used to increase effectiveness and efficiency. Hence, it is clear there is an issue with the acceptance of AI in Bangladesh. Some AML \\&CFT concerns are already being addressed by AI technology. For example, Image Recognition OCR technology are being used in KYC procedures. Primary hindrances to AI integration involve a lack of technical expertise, high expenses, and uncertainties surrounding regulations. This investigation underscores the potential of AI-driven NLP solutions in fortifying efforts to prevent financial crimes in Bangladesh.",
    "summary": "This study investigates the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for adverse media screening in Bangladeshi financial services, finding high accuracy (94%) in detecting financial crime-related content in both English and Bangla. However, it also highlights significant barriers to AI adoption in Bangladesh, including lack of expertise, high costs, and regulatory uncertainty."

    "title": "Enhancing Financial Inclusion and Regulatory Challenges: A Critical Analysis of Digital Banks and Alternative Lenders Through Digital Platforms, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models Integration",
    "published_date": "2024-04-18",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the dual impact of digital banks and alternative lenders on financial inclusion and the regulatory challenges posed by their business models. It discusses the integration of digital platforms, machine learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing financial services accessibility for underserved populations. Through a detailed analysis of operational frameworks and technological infrastructures, this research identifies key mechanisms that facilitate broader financial access and mitigate traditional barriers. Additionally, the paper addresses significant regulatory concerns involving data privacy, algorithmic bias, financial stability, and consumer protection. Employing a mixed-methods approach, which combines quantitative financial data analysis with qualitative insights from industry experts, this paper elucidates the complexities of leveraging digital technology to foster financial inclusivity. The findings underscore the necessity of evolving regulatory frameworks that harmonize innovation with comprehensive risk management. This paper concludes with policy recommendations for regulators, financial institutions, and technology providers, aiming to cultivate a more inclusive and stable financial ecosystem through prudent digital technology integration.",
