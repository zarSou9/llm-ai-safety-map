    "title": "Technological Shocks and Algorithmic Decision Aids in Credence Goods Markets",
    "published_date": "2024-01-31",
    "abstract": "In credence goods markets such as health care or repair services, consumers rely on experts with superior information to adequately diagnose and treat them. Experts, however, are constrained in their diagnostic abilities, which hurts market efficiency and consumer welfare. Technological breakthroughs that substitute or complement expert judgments have the potential to alleviate consumer mistreatment. This article studies how competitive experts adopt novel diagnostic technologies when skills are heterogeneously distributed and obfuscated to consumers. We differentiate between novel technologies that increase expert abilities, and algorithmic decision aids that complement expert judgments, but do not affect an expert's personal diagnostic precision. We show that high-ability experts may be incentivized to forego the decision aid in order to escape a pooling equilibrium by differentiating themselves from low-ability experts. Results from an online experiment support our hypothesis, showing that high-ability experts are significantly less likely than low-ability experts to invest into an algorithmic decision aid. Furthermore, we document pervasive under-investments, and no effect on expert honesty.",
    "summary": "This paper examines how experts in credence goods markets adopt new diagnostic technologies, finding that high-ability experts may avoid algorithmic aids to differentiate themselves from low-ability peers, resulting in under-investment despite potential efficiency gains and no impact on expert honesty."

    "title": "Enhancing Financial Inclusion and Regulatory Challenges: A Critical Analysis of Digital Banks and Alternative Lenders Through Digital Platforms, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models Integration",
    "published_date": "2024-04-18",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the dual impact of digital banks and alternative lenders on financial inclusion and the regulatory challenges posed by their business models. It discusses the integration of digital platforms, machine learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing financial services accessibility for underserved populations. Through a detailed analysis of operational frameworks and technological infrastructures, this research identifies key mechanisms that facilitate broader financial access and mitigate traditional barriers. Additionally, the paper addresses significant regulatory concerns involving data privacy, algorithmic bias, financial stability, and consumer protection. Employing a mixed-methods approach, which combines quantitative financial data analysis with qualitative insights from industry experts, this paper elucidates the complexities of leveraging digital technology to foster financial inclusivity. The findings underscore the necessity of evolving regulatory frameworks that harmonize innovation with comprehensive risk management. This paper concludes with policy recommendations for regulators, financial institutions, and technology providers, aiming to cultivate a more inclusive and stable financial ecosystem through prudent digital technology integration.",

    "title": "The Effect of Product Recommendations on Online Investor Behaviors",
    "published_date": "2023-03-24",
    "abstract": "Despite the popularity of product recommendations on online investment platforms, few studies have explored their impact on investor behaviors. Using data from a global e-commerce platform, we apply regression discontinuity design to causally examine the effects of product recommendations on online investors' mutual fund investments. Our findings indicate that recommended funds experience a significant rise in purchases, especially among low socioeconomic status investors who are most influenced by these recommendations. However, investors tend to suffer significantly worse investment returns after purchasing recommended funds, and this negative impact is also most significant for investors with low socioeconomic status. To explain this disparity, we find investors tend to gather less information and expend reduced effort in fund research when buying recommended funds. Furthermore, investors' redemption timing of recommended funds is less optimal than non-recommended funds. We also find that recommended funds experience a larger return reversal than non-recommended funds. In conclusion, product recommendations make investors behave more irrationally and these negative consequences are most significant for investors with low socioeconomic status, which can amplify wealth inequality among investors in financial markets.",
    "summary": "Product recommendations significantly increase mutual fund purchases, particularly among low socioeconomic investors, but lead to worse investment returns for this group due to reduced research and less optimal investment timing. This suggests that such recommendations exacerbate wealth inequality by promoting irrational investor behavior."

    "title": "How Does China's Household Portfolio Selection Vary with Financial Inclusion?",
    "published_date": "2023-11-02",
    "abstract": "Portfolio underdiversification is one of the most costly losses accumulated over a household's life cycle. We provide new evidence on the impact of financial inclusion services on households' portfolio choice and investment efficiency using 2015, 2017, and 2019 survey data for Chinese households. We hypothesize that higher financial inclusion penetration encourages households to participate in the financial market, leading to better portfolio diversification and investment efficiency. The results of the baseline model are consistent with our proposed hypothesis that higher accessibility to financial inclusion encourages households to invest in risky assets and increases investment efficiency. We further estimate a dynamic double machine learning model to quantitatively investigate the non-linear causal effects and track the dynamic change of those effects over time. We observe that the marginal effect increases over time, and those effects are more pronounced among low-asset, less-educated households and those located in non-rural areas, except for investment efficiency for high-asset households.",
    "summary": "This study finds that increased financial inclusion in China leads to greater household participation in riskier assets and improved investment efficiency, particularly benefiting low-asset and less-educated households in non-rural areas. A dynamic model reveals that this positive effect of financial inclusion strengthens over time."

    "published_date": "2023-01-02",
    "summary": "The author questions the long-term viability of passive global index fund investing, arguing that sustained share price growth exceeding money supply growth is unsustainable unless accompanied by increased money velocity or continuous economic consolidation. They challenge the common assumption that economic growth alone justifies perpetual index fund appreciation."

    "published_date": "2022-01-06",
    "abstract": "We suggest a simple practical method to combine the human and artificial intelligence to both learn best investment practices of fund managers, and provide recommendations to improve them. Our approach is based on a combination of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and RL. First, the IRL component learns the intent of fund managers as suggested by their trading history, and recovers their implied reward function. At the second step, this reward function is used by a direct RL algorithm to optimize asset allocation decisions. We show that our method is able to improve over the performance of individual fund managers.",
    "citation_count": 5,
    "summary": "This paper proposes a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach to asset allocation, using IRL to infer fund manager strategies from historical data and then RL to optimize those strategies for improved performance. The combined method demonstrates superior results compared to individual fund managers."
