### Mini Description

Investigation of how AI-driven investment advice and portfolio management tools influence access to wealth-building opportunities

### Description

Investment Services research examines how AI systems influence access to and quality of investment opportunities across different socioeconomic groups. This encompasses studying how automated investment platforms, robo-advisors, and AI-driven market analysis tools reshape traditional wealth management services and create new pathways for retail investors. Key considerations include the democratization of sophisticated investment strategies, the role of AI in reducing minimum investment thresholds, and the potential for algorithmic bias in investment recommendations.

Researchers investigate how AI-powered investment tools affect decision-making processes and investment outcomes for different user groups. This includes analyzing the effectiveness of personalization algorithms in portfolio management, studying how AI-driven market predictions influence investor behavior, and examining the transparency and interpretability of automated investment decisions. Special attention is paid to how these technologies might either bridge or widen the wealth gap between sophisticated and novice investors.

A critical focus is understanding how AI deployment in investment services affects market dynamics and systemic risk. This includes studying the interaction between automated trading systems, examining how AI-driven herding behavior might amplify market volatility, and investigating the robustness of AI investment systems during market stress. Researchers also explore how regulatory frameworks should evolve to ensure fair access while protecting investors from AI-related risks, particularly regarding disclosure requirements, fiduciary responsibilities, and algorithmic accountability.
