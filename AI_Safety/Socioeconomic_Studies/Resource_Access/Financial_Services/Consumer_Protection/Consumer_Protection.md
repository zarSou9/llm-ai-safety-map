Analysis of how AI deployment in financial services affects consumer rights, privacy, and vulnerability to financial exploitation

### Description

Consumer Protection in AI-driven financial services focuses on safeguarding individuals' financial interests and rights as artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate access to and delivery of financial products. This research area examines how AI deployment affects consumer vulnerability, information asymmetry, and power dynamics between financial institutions and their customers. Key considerations include the transparency of AI decision-making, the effectiveness of existing regulatory frameworks, and the development of new protection mechanisms suited to an AI-driven financial landscape.

A central challenge is ensuring meaningful consent and understanding in automated financial interactions. This involves studying how consumers comprehend AI-driven financial products, their ability to challenge algorithmic decisions, and their capacity to maintain agency in increasingly automated financial systems. Researchers investigate how different interface designs, disclosure mechanisms, and explanation methods affect consumer awareness and decision-making quality. Special attention is paid to vulnerable populations who may face increased risks from predatory practices enabled by AI systems.

The field also examines how AI systems influence market fairness and stability from a consumer perspective. This includes studying how AI-powered high-frequency trading, dynamic pricing, and automated market making affect retail investors and everyday consumers. Researchers analyze patterns of algorithmic discrimination, investigate the effectiveness of automated fraud detection systems, and develop frameworks for evaluating whether AI-driven financial innovations genuinely serve consumer interests rather than merely extracting value.
