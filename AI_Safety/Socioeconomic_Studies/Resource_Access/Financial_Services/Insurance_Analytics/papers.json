    "published_date": "2022-02-14",
    "summary": "The article highlights common statistical errors, primarily focusing on the misuse of Gaussian assumptions in modeling socio-economic variables and misinterpretations of p-values, base rates, and statistical power. These errors lead to inaccurate conclusions and unreliable results in various fields, including finance and scientific research."

    "title": "Machine learning improves accounting estimates: evidence from insurance payments",
    "abstract": "Managerial estimates are ubiquitous in accounting: most balance sheet and income statement items are based on estimates; some, such as the pension and employee stock options expenses, derive from multiple estimates. These estimates are affected by objective estimation errors as well as by managerial manipulation, thereby harming the reliability and relevance of financial reports. We show that machine learning can substantially improve managerial estimates. Specifically, using insurance companies' data on loss reserves (future customer claims) estimates and realizations, we document that the loss estimates generated by machine learning were superior to actual managerial estimates reported in financial statements in four out of five insurance lines examined. Our evidence suggests that machine learning techniques can be highly useful to managers and auditors in improving accounting estimates, thereby enhancing the usefulness of financial information to investors.",

    "title": "A neural network model for solvency calculations in life insurance",
    "abstract": "Abstract Insurance companies make extensive use of Monte Carlo simulations in their capital and solvency models. To overcome the computational problems associated with Monte Carlo simulations, most large life insurance companies use proxy models such as replicating portfolios (RPs). In this paper, we present an example based on a variable annuity guarantee, showing the main challenges faced by practitioners in the construction of RPs: the feature engineering step and subsequent basis function selection problem. We describe how neural networks can be used as a proxy model and how to apply risk-neutral pricing on a neural network to integrate such a model into a market risk framework. The proposed model naturally solves the feature engineering and feature selection problems of RPs.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes using neural networks as proxy models for Monte Carlo simulations in life insurance solvency calculations, addressing the challenges of feature engineering and selection inherent in traditional replicating portfolio methods. The approach integrates risk-neutral pricing to fit within existing market risk frameworks."
