### Mini Description

Analysis of how AI-powered risk assessment and premium calculation affects insurance availability and pricing for different groups

### Description

Insurance Analytics examines how AI systems influence the assessment, pricing, and distribution of insurance products across different population segments. This research area investigates how machine learning models process demographic, behavioral, and environmental data to estimate risk, determine premiums, and automate underwriting decisions. Key considerations include the accuracy and fairness of risk prediction models, the interpretability of automated decisions, and the potential for AI systems to either mitigate or amplify existing disparities in insurance access.

A central focus is understanding how AI-driven risk assessment models handle different types of insurance products, from life and health insurance to property and casualty coverage. Researchers analyze how these systems incorporate traditional actuarial methods with novel data sources and machine learning techniques, examining their impact on risk pooling, adverse selection, and moral hazard. This includes studying how AI systems might create new forms of risk segmentation that could fundamentally alter the social function of insurance.

The field also investigates how AI deployment affects the relationship between insurers and policyholders, particularly regarding transparency, privacy, and discrimination. This encompasses studying how continuous monitoring and dynamic pricing through IoT devices and digital platforms influence risk behavior and premium adjustments. Researchers examine how different regulatory frameworks and market structures might better align AI-driven insurance practices with societal goals of accessibility and fairness while maintaining market viability.
