### Mini Description

Study of how AI-driven credit scoring and loan approval systems affect lending decisions and credit access across different population segments

### Description

Algorithmic lending research examines how AI and machine learning systems influence credit decisions and loan accessibility across different population segments. This encompasses the technical design of credit scoring algorithms, their integration with traditional underwriting processes, and their impact on lending outcomes. Key areas include the use of alternative data sources, the development of explainable AI models for credit decisions, and the evaluation of fairness metrics in automated lending systems.

A central challenge is balancing the potential for AI to expand credit access through more sophisticated risk assessment against the risk of perpetuating or amplifying existing biases. Researchers investigate how different types of training data, model architectures, and optimization objectives affect lending outcomes for historically underserved groups. This includes studying how AI systems handle missing or non-traditional credit information, and developing methods to detect and mitigate discriminatory patterns in automated lending decisions.

The field also explores the regulatory and compliance implications of AI-driven lending, including requirements for model transparency, accountability mechanisms, and fair lending laws. Research focuses on developing auditing frameworks to assess algorithmic fairness, creating interpretable models that can satisfy regulatory requirements, and designing intervention strategies when biased outcomes are detected. This includes studying how different fairness definitions and constraints affect both business objectives and social outcomes.
