    "title": "Ensuring Equitable Financial Decisions: Leveraging Counterfactual Fairness and Deep Learning for Bias",
    "published_date": "2024-08-27",
    "abstract": "Concerns regarding fairness and bias have been raised in recent years due to the growing use of machine learning models in crucial decision-making processes, especially when it comes to delicate characteristics like gender. In order to address biases in machine learning models, this research paper investigates advanced bias mitigation techniques, with a particular focus on counterfactual fairness in conjunction with data augmentation. The study looks into how these integrated approaches can lessen gender bias in the financial industry, specifically in loan approval procedures. We show that these approaches are effective in achieving more equitable results through thorough testing and assessment on a skewed financial dataset. The findings emphasize how crucial it is to use fairness-aware techniques when creating machine learning models in order to guarantee morally righteous and impartial decision-making.",
    "summary": "This paper explores using counterfactual fairness and data augmentation with deep learning to mitigate gender bias in loan approval algorithms, demonstrating improved equitable outcomes through rigorous testing on a biased financial dataset. The research highlights the importance of fairness-aware machine learning in financial decision-making."

    "title": "Less Discriminatory Alternative and Interpretable XGBoost Framework for Binary Classification",
    "published_date": "2024-10-24",
    "abstract": "Fair lending practices and model interpretability are crucial concerns in the financial industry, especially given the increasing use of complex machine learning models. In response to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) requirement to protect consumers against unlawful discrimination, we introduce LDA-XGB1, a novel less discriminatory alternative (LDA) machine learning model for fair and interpretable binary classification. LDA-XGB1 is developed through biobjective optimization that balances accuracy and fairness, with both objectives formulated using binning and information value. It leverages the predictive power and computational efficiency of XGBoost while ensuring inherent model interpretability, including the enforcement of monotonic constraints. We evaluate LDA-XGB1 on two datasets: SimuCredit, a simulated credit approval dataset, and COMPAS, a real-world recidivism prediction dataset. Our results demonstrate that LDA-XGB1 achieves an effective balance between predictive accuracy, fairness, and interpretability, often outperforming traditional fair lending models. This approach equips financial institutions with a powerful tool to meet regulatory requirements for fair lending while maintaining the advantages of advanced machine learning techniques.",
    "summary": "LDA-XGB1 is a novel, interpretable machine learning model for fair binary classification that uses biobjective optimization to balance accuracy and fairness, outperforming traditional methods in experiments on simulated and real-world datasets."

    "title": "Fair Models in Credit: Intersectional Discrimination and the Amplification of Inequity",
    "published_date": "2023-08-01",
    "abstract": "The increasing usage of new data sources and machine learning (ML) technology in credit modeling raises concerns with regards to potentially unfair decision-making that rely on protected characteristics (e.g., race, sex, age) or other socio-economic and demographic data. The authors demonstrate the impact of such algorithmic bias in the microfinance context. Difficulties in assessing credit are disproportionately experienced among vulnerable groups, however, very little is known about inequities in credit allocation between groups defined, not only by single, but by multiple and intersecting social categories. Drawing from the intersectionality paradigm, the study examines intersectional horizontal inequities in credit access by gender, age, marital status, single parent status and number of children. This paper utilizes data from the Spanish microfinance market as its context to demonstrate how pluralistic realities and intersectional identities can shape patterns of credit allocation when using automated decision-making systems. With ML technology being oblivious to societal good or bad, we find that a more thorough examination of intersectionality can enhance the algorithmic fairness lens to more authentically empower action for equitable outcomes and present a fairer path forward. We demonstrate that while on a high-level, fairness may exist superficially, unfairness can exacerbate at lower levels given combinatorial effects; in other words, the core fairness problem may be more complicated than current literature demonstrates. We find that in addition to legally protected characteristics, sensitive attributes such as single parent status and number of children can result in imbalanced harm. We discuss the implications of these findings for the financial services industry.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates intersectional discrimination in algorithmic credit scoring, using Spanish microfinance data to show how machine learning models, while appearing fair overall, can create unfair outcomes for specific demographic groups due to the combined effects of multiple sensitive attributes. The study highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of intersectionality to achieve equitable credit allocation."

    "title": "Uncovering the Source of Machine Bias",
    "published_date": "2022-01-09",
    "abstract": "We develop a structural econometric model to capture the decision dynamics of human evaluators on an online micro-lending platform, and estimate the model parameters using a real-world dataset. We find two types of biases in gender, preference-based bias and belief-based bias, are present in human evaluators' decisions. Both types of biases are in favor of female applicants. Through counterfactual simulations, we quantify the effect of gender bias on loan granting outcomes and the welfare of the company and the borrowers. Our results imply that both the existence of the preference-based bias and that of the belief-based bias reduce the company's profits. When the preference-based bias is removed, the company earns more profits. When the belief-based bias is removed, the company's profits also increase. Both increases result from raising the approval probability for borrowers, especially male borrowers, who eventually pay back loans. For borrowers, the elimination of either bias decreases the gender gap of the true positive rates in the credit risk evaluation. We also train machine learning algorithms on both the real-world data and the data from the counterfactual simulations. We compare the decisions made by those algorithms to see how evaluators' biases are inherited by the algorithms and reflected in machine-based decisions. We find that machine learning algorithms can mitigate both the preference-based bias and the belief-based bias.",

    "summary": "This study uses a structural econometric model to identify and quantify preference-based and belief-based gender biases favoring female applicants in a micro-lending platform, finding that eliminating these biases, despite favoring male applicants, increases both company profits and borrower welfare by improving loan repayment rates."
