### Mini Description

Study of how AI impacts access to educational opportunities, including both formal institutions and self-directed learning platforms

### Description

Educational Resources examines how AI technologies influence access to and quality of learning opportunities across different populations. This encompasses both the direct implementation of AI in educational settings - such as intelligent tutoring systems, automated grading, and personalized learning platforms - and the broader implications of AI adoption on educational equity and effectiveness. Key research questions include how AI-enhanced education affects learning outcomes across different demographic groups, what new barriers to access might emerge, and how to ensure AI educational tools serve diverse learning needs.

A critical focus is understanding how AI deployment in education can either bridge or widen existing achievement gaps. This includes studying how factors like technological literacy, device access, and internet connectivity affect students' ability to benefit from AI-enhanced learning tools. Researchers investigate both formal educational settings (schools, universities) and informal learning environments (online courses, self-directed learning platforms), examining how AI technologies transform traditional educational models and create new pathways for skill development.

The field also explores how AI impacts the roles of educators, educational institutions, and support systems. This includes analyzing changes in teaching methodologies, curriculum development, and assessment practices as AI tools become more prevalent. Particular attention is paid to ensuring that AI educational technologies remain accessible and beneficial to traditionally underserved communities, while also studying how these tools can be designed to accommodate different learning styles, cultural contexts, and educational needs.
