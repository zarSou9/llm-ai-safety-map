### Mini Description

Study of how AI transforms testing, grading, and progress monitoring, including impacts on fairness and accuracy in student evaluation

### Description

Educational Assessment in AI safety research examines how artificial intelligence systems transform the evaluation of student learning, knowledge acquisition, and skill development. This includes studying the implementation of AI-powered assessment tools, their impact on measurement accuracy and fairness, and the broader implications for educational equity. Key challenges include ensuring algorithmic fairness across diverse student populations, maintaining assessment validity while leveraging AI capabilities, and balancing automation with human oversight.

The field investigates both traditional assessment formats enhanced by AI (such as automated grading of essays and problem sets) and novel assessment approaches enabled by AI technologies (like real-time performance evaluation and adaptive testing). Researchers analyze how AI systems can capture and evaluate complex learning outcomes, including higher-order thinking skills, creativity, and collaborative abilities. This involves developing new assessment frameworks that can effectively utilize AI's capacity for processing rich, multimodal data while maintaining interpretability and accountability.

A critical focus is understanding how AI-powered assessments influence student behavior, learning strategies, and educational outcomes. This includes studying potential gaming behaviors, the impact of continuous assessment on student stress levels, and how different demographic groups interact with automated evaluation systems. Researchers also examine how AI assessment tools affect teacher decision-making, pedagogical approaches, and the relationship between formative and summative assessment practices.
