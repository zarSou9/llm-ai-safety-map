    "title": "The Rise of Artificial Intelligence in Educational Measurement: Opportunities and Ethical Challenges",
    "published_date": "2024-06-27",
    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in educational measurement has revolutionized assessment methods, enabling automated scoring, rapid content analysis, and personalized feedback through machine learning and natural language processing. These advancements provide timely, consistent feedback and valuable insights into student performance, thereby enhancing the assessment experience. However, the deployment of AI in education also raises significant ethical concerns regarding validity, reliability, transparency, fairness, and equity. Issues such as algorithmic bias and the opacity of AI decision-making processes pose risks of perpetuating inequalities and affecting assessment outcomes. Responding to these concerns, various stakeholders, including educators, policymakers, and organizations, have developed guidelines to ensure ethical AI use in education. The National Council of Measurement in Education's Special Interest Group on AI in Measurement and Education (AIME) also focuses on establishing ethical standards and advancing research in this area. In this paper, a diverse group of AIME members examines the ethical implications of AI-powered tools in educational measurement, explores significant challenges such as automation bias and environmental impact, and proposes solutions to ensure AI's responsible and effective use in education.",

    "title": "Who is Helping Whom? Student Concerns about AI- Teacher Collaboration in Higher Education Classrooms",
    "published_date": "2024-12-19",
    "abstract": "AI's integration into education promises to equip teachers with data-driven insights and intervene in student learning. Despite the intended advancements, there is a lack of understanding of interactions and emerging dynamics in classrooms where various stakeholders including teachers, students, and AI, collaborate. This paper aims to understand how students perceive the implications of AI in Education in terms of classroom collaborative dynamics, especially AI used to observe students and notify teachers to provide targeted help. Using the story completion method, we analyzed narratives from 65 participants, highlighting three challenges: AI decontextualizing of the educational context; AI-teacher cooperation with bias concerns and power disparities; and AI's impact on student behavior that further challenges AI's effectiveness. We argue that for effective and ethical AI-facilitated cooperative education, future AIEd design must factor in the situated nature of implementation. Designers must consider the broader nuances of the education context, impacts on multiple stakeholders, dynamics involving these stakeholders, and the interplay among potential consequences for AI systems and stakeholders. It is crucial to understand the values in the situated context, the capacity and limitations of both AI and humans for effective cooperation, and any implications to the relevant ecosystem.",
    "summary": "This study investigates student perceptions of AI-teacher collaboration in higher education, revealing concerns about AI's decontextualized interventions, biased AI-teacher cooperation, and the impact of AI on student behavior. The authors argue that effective AI in education requires considering the situated context and the complex interplay between AI, teachers, and students."

    "title": "Towards Responsible Development of Generative AI for Education: An Evaluation-Driven Approach",
    "published_date": "2024-05-21",
    "abstract": "A major challenge facing the world is the provision of equitable and universal access to quality education. Recent advances in generative AI (gen AI) have created excitement about the potential of new technologies to offer a personal tutor for every learner and a teaching assistant for every teacher. The full extent of this dream, however, has not yet materialised. We argue that this is primarily due to the difficulties with verbalising pedagogical intuitions into gen AI prompts and the lack of good evaluation practices, reinforced by the challenges in defining excellent pedagogy. Here we present our work collaborating with learners and educators to translate high level principles from learning science into a pragmatic set of seven diverse educational benchmarks, spanning quantitative, qualitative, automatic and human evaluations; and to develop a new set of fine-tuning datasets to improve the pedagogical capabilities of Gemini, introducing LearnLM-Tutor. Our evaluations show that LearnLM-Tutor is consistently preferred over a prompt tuned Gemini by educators and learners on a number of pedagogical dimensions. We hope that this work can serve as a first step towards developing a comprehensive educational evaluation framework, and that this can enable rapid progress within the AI and EdTech communities towards maximising the positive impact of gen AI in education.",

    "summary": "This paper advocates for responsible generative AI development in education, proposing a novel evaluation framework with seven benchmarks and a fine-tuned model (LearnLM-Tutor) that outperforms a baseline in educator and learner preference tests. The authors aim to establish robust evaluation practices to maximize the positive impact of AI in education."

    "title": "Do Tutors Learn from Equity Training and Can Generative AI Assess It?",
    "published_date": "2024-12-15",
    "abstract": "Equity is a core concern of learning analytics. However, applications that teach and assess equity skills, particularly at scale are lacking, often due to barriers in evaluating language. Advances in generative AI via large language models (LLMs) are being used in a wide range of applications, with this present work assessing its use in the equity domain. We evaluate tutor performance within an online lesson on enhancing tutors' skills when responding to students in potentially inequitable situations. We apply a mixed-method approach to analyze the performance of 81 undergraduate remote tutors. We find marginally significant learning gains with increases in tutors' self-reported confidence in their knowledge in responding to middle school students experiencing possible inequities from pretest to posttest. Both GPT-4o and GPT-4-turbo demonstrate proficiency in assessing tutors ability to predict and explain the best approach. Balancing performance, efficiency, and cost, we determine that few-shot learning using GPT-4o is the preferred model. This work makes available a dataset of lesson log data, tutor responses, rubrics for human annotation, and generative AI prompts. Future work involves leveling the difficulty among scenarios and enhancing LLM prompts for large-scale grading and assessment.",
    "summary": "This study investigated whether undergraduate tutors improved their equity-focused tutoring skills after completing an online lesson, using a mixed-methods approach with 81 participants. The researchers found modest learning gains and demonstrated that GPT-4 models can effectively assess tutor performance in predicting and explaining equitable tutoring strategies."

    "published_date": "2024-09-23",
    "abstract": "This study addresses the critical challenges of assessing foundational academic skills by leveraging advancements in natural language processing (NLP). Traditional assessment methods often struggle to provide timely and comprehensive feedback on key cognitive and linguistic aspects, such as co-herence, syntax, and analytical reasoning. Our approach inte-grates multiple state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, RoBERTa, BART, DeBERTa, and T5, within an ensemble learning framework. These models are combined through stacking techniques using LightGBM and Ridge regression to enhance predictive accuracy. The methodology involves detailed data preprocessing, feature extraction, and pseudo-label learning to optimize model performance. By incorporating sophisticated NLP techniques and ensemble learning, this study significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of assessments, offering a robust solution that surpasses traditional methods and opens new avenues for educational technology research focused on enhancing core academic competencies.",

    "title": "Emotionally Enriched Feedback via Generative AI",
    "published_date": "2024-10-19",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of emotionally enriched AI feedback on student engagement and emotional responses in higher education. Leveraging the Control-Value Theory of Achievement Emotions, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment involving 425 participants where the experimental group received AI feedback enhanced with motivational elements, while the control group received neutral feedback. Our findings reveal that emotionally enriched feedback is perceived as more beneficial and helps reduce negative emotions, particularly anger, towards receiving feedback. However, it had no significant impact on the level of engagement with feedback or the quality of student work. These results suggest that incorporating emotional elements into AI-driven feedback can positively influence student perceptions and emotional well-being, without compromising work quality. Our study contributes to the growing body of research on AI in education by highlighting the importance of emotional considerations in educational technology design.",
    "summary": "A randomized controlled trial (N=425) found that AI feedback incorporating motivational elements reduced negative student emotional responses, specifically anger, towards feedback, though it did not improve student engagement or work quality. This suggests emotional enrichment in AI feedback can improve student well-being without impacting performance."
