### Mini Description

Investigation of how AI systems affect the quality, diversity, and reliability of consumed information

### Description

Information Quality Dynamics investigates how AI systems influence the characteristics, distribution, and evolution of information quality in digital ecosystems. This encompasses studying how algorithmic content promotion and filtering mechanisms affect the prevalence of accurate versus misleading information, the diversity of perspectives represented, and the depth versus superficiality of content. Research in this area examines both direct effects, such as how recommendation systems prioritize certain content qualities, and indirect effects, like how AI-driven content creation and modification tools impact overall information quality.

A central challenge is developing robust metrics and frameworks for evaluating information quality in AI-mediated environments. This includes measuring factors like factual accuracy, source credibility, contextual relevance, and intellectual rigor, while accounting for the dynamic and often subjective nature of quality assessment. Researchers investigate how different AI architectures and optimization objectives influence these quality metrics, and how various stakeholders - from individual users to platform operators - respond to and influence quality dynamics.

Current research priorities focus on understanding and addressing emergent phenomena like AI-amplified misinformation cascades, quality deterioration in AI-generated content, and the potential displacement of high-quality human-created content. This includes developing mechanisms for quality preservation and enhancement, studying the interaction between AI systems and human quality control processes, and investigating how different platform governance models affect information quality outcomes. Particular attention is paid to how these dynamics vary across different domains, languages, and cultural contexts.
