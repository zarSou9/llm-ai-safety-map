    "title": "Towards Trustable Language Models: Investigating Information Quality of Large Language Models",
    "published_date": "2024-01-23",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLM) are generating information at a rapid pace, requiring users to increasingly rely and trust the data. Despite remarkable advances of LLM, Information generated by LLM is not completely trustworthy, due to challenges in information quality. Specifically, integrity of Information quality decreases due to unreliable, biased, tokenization during pre-training of LLM. Moreover, due to decreased information quality issues, has led towards hallucination, fabricated information. Unreliable information can lead towards flawed decisions in businesses, which impacts economic activity. In this work, we introduce novel mathematical information quality evaluation of LLM, we furthermore analyze and highlight information quality challenges, scaling laws to systematically scale language models.",

    "title": "A Dynamical Systems Approach to Bots and Online Political Communication",
    "published_date": "2024-05-28",
    "abstract": "Bots have become increasingly prevalent in the digital sphere and have taken up a proactive role in shaping democratic processes. While previous studies have focused on their influence at the individual level, their potential macro-level impact on communication dynamics is still little understood. This study adopts an information theoretic approach from dynamical systems theory to examine the role of political bots shaping the dynamics of an online political discussion on Twitter. We quantify the components of this dynamic process in terms of its complexity, predictability, and the remaining uncertainty. Our findings suggest that bot activity is associated with increased complexity and uncertainty in the structural dynamics of online political communication. This work serves as a showcase for the use of information-theoretic measures from dynamical systems theory in modeling human-bot dynamics as a computational process that unfolds over time.",
    "summary": "This study uses dynamical systems theory to analyze how political bots on Twitter affect online political communication, finding that bot activity increases the complexity and uncertainty of the communication dynamics. The research demonstrates a novel information-theoretic approach to modeling human-bot interactions."

    "summary": "This article explores the \"Waluigi Effect\" and other unusual behaviors in large language models (LLMs). It argues that while directly querying LLMs often yields incorrect answers due to their training data reflecting internet inaccuracies, employing \"flattery\" and dialogue prompts—creating a persona of a knowledgeable and reliable character—significantly improves accuracy by simulating a conversation with a trustworthy source."

    "summary": "This article proposes a reframing of AI alignment, arguing that AI should aim to model the desired *changes* in state driven by human values, rather than static goals. This approach attempts to address the pitfalls of traditional value learning by incorporating both intended values and errors in predicting human behavior."

    "title": "The Value of Information When Deciding What to Learn",
    "published_date": "2021-10-26",
    "abstract": "All sequential decision-making agents explore so as to acquire knowledge about a particular target. It is often the responsibility of the agent designer to construct this target which, in rich and complex environments, constitutes a onerous burden; without full knowledge of the environment itself, a designer may forge a sub-optimal learning target that poorly balances the amount of information an agent must acquire to identify the target against the target's associated performance shortfall. While recent work has developed a connection between learning targets and rate-distortion theory to address this challenge and empower agents that decide what to learn in an automated fashion, the proposed algorithm does not optimally tackle the equally important challenge of efficient information acquisition. In this work, building upon the seminal design principle of information-directed sampling (Russo&Van Roy, 2014), we address this shortcoming directly to couple optimal information acquisition with the optimal design of learning targets. Along the way, we offer new insights into learning targets from the literature on rate-distortion theory before turning to empirical results that confirm the value of information when deciding what to learn.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel algorithm for efficient information acquisition in sequential decision-making, improving upon existing methods by optimally designing learning targets and leveraging information-directed sampling to minimize the trade-off between information gathering and performance. Empirical results validate the enhanced value of information in this improved learning framework."
