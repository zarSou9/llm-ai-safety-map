    "title": "Cultural Incongruencies in Artificial Intelligence",
    "published_date": "2022-11-19",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems attempt to imitate human behavior. How well they do this imitation is often used to assess their utility and to attribute human-like (or artificial) intelligence to them. However, most work on AI refers to and relies on human intelligence without accounting for the fact that human behavior is inherently shaped by the cultural contexts they are embedded in, the values and beliefs they hold, and the social practices they follow. Additionally, since AI technologies are mostly conceived and developed in just a handful of countries, they embed the cultural values and practices of these countries. Similarly, the data that is used to train the models also fails to equitably represent global cultural diversity. Problems therefore arise when these technologies interact with globally diverse societies and cultures, with different values and interpretive practices. In this position paper, we describe a set of cultural dependencies and incongruencies in the context of AI-based language and vision technologies, and reflect on the possibilities of and potential strategies towards addressing these incongruencies.",

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence systems, primarily developed in a few cultures, often fail to account for the diverse cultural contexts of global users, leading to incongruencies between AI behavior and diverse societal values and practices. Addressing this requires acknowledging and mitigating the cultural biases embedded in AI development and training data."

    "title": "Rethinking AI Cultural Evaluation",
    "published_date": "2025-01-13",
    "abstract": "As AI systems become more integrated into society, evaluating their capacity to align with diverse cultural values is crucial for their responsible deployment. Current evaluation methods predominantly rely on multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets. In this study, we demonstrate that MCQs are insufficient for capturing the complexity of cultural values expressed in open-ended scenarios. Our findings highlight significant discrepancies between MCQ-based assessments and the values conveyed in unconstrained interactions. Based on these findings, we recommend moving beyond MCQs to adopt more open-ended, context-specific assessments that better reflect how AI models engage with cultural values in realistic settings.",
    "summary": "Current AI cultural value evaluations relying on multiple-choice questions are insufficient, as demonstrated by discrepancies between MCQ assessments and open-ended responses; the authors advocate for more nuanced, open-ended evaluation methods reflecting real-world interactions."

    "title": "Do Generative AI Models Output Harm while Representing Non-Western Cultures: Evidence from A Community-Centered Approach",
    "published_date": "2024-07-20",
    "abstract": "Our research investigates the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, specifically text-to-image generators (T2Is), on the representation of non-Western cultures, with a focus on Indian contexts. Despite the transformative potential of T2Is in content creation, concerns have arisen regarding biases that may lead to misrepresentations and marginalizations. Through a Non-Western community-centered approach\nand grounded theory analysis of 5 focus groups from diverse Indian subcultures, we explore how T2I outputs to English input prompts depict Indian culture and its subcultures, uncovering novel representational harms such as exoticism and cultural misappropriation. These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive and culturally sensitive T2I systems. We propose design guidelines informed by a sociotechnical perspective, contributing to the development of more equitable and representative GAI technologies globally. Our work underscores the necessity of adopting a community-centered approach to comprehend the sociotechnical dynamics of these models, complementing existing work in this space while identifying and addressing the potential negative repercussions and harms that may arise as these models are deployed on a global scale.",

    "title": "Artificial Generational Intelligence: Cultural Accumulation in Reinforcement Learning",
    "published_date": "2024-06-01",
    "abstract": "Cultural accumulation drives the open-ended and diverse progress in capabilities spanning human history. It builds an expanding body of knowledge and skills by combining individual exploration with inter-generational information transmission. Despite its widespread success among humans, the capacity for artificial learning agents to accumulate culture remains under-explored. In particular, approaches to reinforcement learning typically strive for improvements over only a single lifetime. Generational algorithms that do exist fail to capture the open-ended, emergent nature of cultural accumulation, which allows individuals to trade-off innovation and imitation. Building on the previously demonstrated ability for reinforcement learning agents to perform social learning, we find that training setups which balance this with independent learning give rise to cultural accumulation. These accumulating agents outperform those trained for a single lifetime with the same cumulative experience. We explore this accumulation by constructing two models under two distinct notions of a generation: episodic generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-context learning and train-time generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-weights learning. In-context and in-weights cultural accumulation can be interpreted as analogous to knowledge and skill accumulation, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present general models that achieve emergent cultural accumulation in reinforcement learning, opening up new avenues towards more open-ended learning systems, as well as presenting new opportunities for modelling human culture.",
    "citation_count": 3,
    "summary": "This paper introduces artificial generational intelligence models that enable cultural accumulation in reinforcement learning, demonstrating that agents trained with a balance of independent and social learning outperform single-lifetime trained agents with equivalent experience by accumulating knowledge and skills across generations. The models achieve emergent cultural accumulation through either in-context (knowledge) or in-weights (skill) learning, analogous to human cultural transmission."

    "title": "Mutual benefits of social learning and algorithmic mediation for cumulative culture",
    "published_date": "2024-10-01",
    "abstract": "The remarkable ecological success of humans is often attributed to our ability to develop complex cultural artefacts that enable us to cope with environmental challenges. The evolution of complex culture (cumulative cultural evolution) is usually modeled as a collective process in which individuals invent new artefacts (innovation) and copy information from others (social learning). This classic picture overlooks the fact that in the digital age, intelligent algorithms are increasingly mediating information between humans, with potential consequences for cumulative cultural evolution. Building on an established model of cultural evolution, we investigate the combined effects of network-based social learning and a simplistic version of algorithmic mediation on cultural accumulation. We find that algorithmic mediation has a strong impact on cultural accumulation and that this impact generally increases as social networks become less densely connected. Moreover, cultural accumulation tends to be optimal when social learning and algorithmic mediation are combined, and the optimal ratio depends on the network's density. Our modeling results are a first step towards formalising the impact of intelligent algorithms on cumulative cultural evolution within an established framework. Models of this kind will also help to uncover mechanisms of human-machine interaction in cultural contexts, guiding hypotheses for future experimental testing.",
    "summary": "This paper models the combined effects of social learning and algorithmic mediation on cumulative cultural evolution, finding that their synergistic interaction optimizes cultural accumulation, particularly in less densely connected social networks. The optimal balance between these two mechanisms depends on the network's structure."

    "title": "Exploring the Intersection of Complex Aesthetics and Generative AI for Promoting Cultural Creativity in Rural China after the Post-Pandemic Era",
    "published_date": "2023-09-05",
    "abstract": "This paper explores using generative AI and aesthetics to promote cultural creativity in rural China amidst COVID-19's impact. Through literature reviews, case studies, surveys, and text analysis, it examines art and technology applications in rural contexts and identifies key challenges. The study finds artworks often fail to resonate locally, while reliance on external artists limits sustainability. Hence, nurturing grassroots \"artist villagers\" through AI is proposed. Our approach involves training machine learning on subjective aesthetics to generate culturally relevant content. Interactive AI media can also boost tourism while preserving heritage. This pioneering research puts forth original perspectives on the intersection of AI and aesthetics to invigorate rural culture. It advocates holistic integration of technology and emphasizes AI's potential as a creative enabler versus replacement. Ultimately, it lays the groundwork for further exploration of leveraging AI innovations to empower rural communities. This timely study contributes to growing interest in emerging technologies to address critical issues facing rural China.",

    "published_date": "2023-11-23",
    "abstract": "Abstract Culture fundamentally shapes people's reasoning, behavior, and communication. As people increasingly use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to expedite and automate personal and professional tasks, cultural values embedded in AI models may bias people's authentic expression and contribute to the dominance of certain cultures. We conduct a disaggregated evaluation of cultural bias for five widely used large language models (OpenAI's GPT-4o/4-turbo/4/3.5-turbo/3) by comparing the models' responses to nationally representative survey data. All models exhibit cultural values resembling English-speaking and Protestant European countries. We test cultural prompting as a control strategy to increase cultural alignment for each country/territory. For later models (GPT-4, 4-turbo, 4o), this improves the cultural alignment of the models' output for 71–81% of countries and territories. We suggest using cultural prompting and ongoing evaluation to reduce cultural bias in the output of generative AI.",
    "citation_count": 33,
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 exhibit cultural biases reflecting English-speaking Protestant European values, but cultural prompting techniques partially mitigate this bias, improving alignment for most countries tested."
