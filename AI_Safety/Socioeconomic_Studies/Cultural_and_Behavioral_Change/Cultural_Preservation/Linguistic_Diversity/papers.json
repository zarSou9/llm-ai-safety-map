    "title": "Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence to Vitalize Endangered Indigenous Languages: Technologies and Experiences",
    "published_date": "2024-07-17",
    "abstract": "Since 2022 we have been exploring application areas and technologies in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) and modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as Large Language Models (LLMs), can be employed to foster the usage and facilitate the documentation of Indigenous languages which are in danger of disappearing. We start by discussing the decreasing diversity of languages in the world and how working with Indigenous languages poses unique ethical challenges for AI and NLP. To address those challenges, we propose an alternative development AI cycle based on community engagement and usage. Then, we report encouraging results in the development of high-quality machine learning translators for Indigenous languages by fine-tuning state-of-the-art (SOTA) translators with tiny amounts of data and discuss how to avoid some common pitfalls in the process. We also present prototypes we have built in projects done in 2023 and 2024 with Indigenous communities in Brazil, aimed at facilitating writing, and discuss the development of Indigenous Language Models (ILMs) as a replicable and scalable way to create spell-checkers, next-word predictors, and similar tools. Finally, we discuss how we envision a future for language documentation where dying languages are preserved as interactive language models.",
    "summary": "This paper explores using AI and NLP, particularly LLMs, to revitalize endangered Indigenous languages, emphasizing community-driven development to address ethical concerns and showcasing successful applications like machine translation and Indigenous Language Model creation for tools such as spell-checkers. The authors propose interactive language models as a future preservation method."

    "title": "Diversity and Language Technology: How Techno-Linguistic Bias Can Cause Epistemic Injustice",
    "published_date": "2023-07-25",
    "abstract": "It is well known that AI-based language technology -- large language models, machine translation systems, multilingual dictionaries, and corpora -- is currently limited to 2 to 3 percent of the world's most widely spoken and/or financially and politically best supported languages. In response, recent research efforts have sought to extend the reach of AI technology to ``underserved languages.'' In this paper, we show that many of these attempts produce flawed solutions that adhere to a hard-wired representational preference for certain languages, which we call techno-linguistic bias. Techno-linguistic bias is distinct from the well-established phenomenon of linguistic bias as it does not concern the languages represented but rather the design of the technologies. As we show through the paper, techno-linguistic bias can result in systems that can only express concepts that are part of the language and culture of dominant powers, unable to correctly represent concepts from other communities. We argue that at the root of this problem lies a systematic tendency of technology developer communities to apply a simplistic understanding of diversity which does not do justice to the more profound differences that languages, and ultimately the communities that speak them, embody. Drawing on the concept of epistemic injustice, we point to the broader sociopolitical consequences of the bias we identify and show how it can lead not only to a disregard for valuable aspects of diversity but also to an under-representation of the needs and diverse worldviews of marginalized language communities.",

    "summary": "The paper argues that current efforts to expand AI language technology to underserved languages often perpetuate \"techno-linguistic bias,\" favoring dominant languages and cultures in system design, resulting in epistemic injustice against marginalized communities. This bias stems from a simplistic understanding of diversity that fails to account for profound cultural and linguistic differences, leading to misrepresentation and disregard of diverse worldviews."

    "title": "Towards Bridging the Digital Language Divide",
    "published_date": "2023-07-25",
    "abstract": "It is a well-known fact that current AI-based language technology -- language models, machine translation systems, multilingual dictionaries and corpora -- focuses on the world's 2-3% most widely spoken languages. Recent research efforts have attempted to expand the coverage of AI technology to `under-resourced languages.' The goal of our paper is to bring attention to a phenomenon that we call linguistic bias: multilingual language processing systems often exhibit a hardwired, yet usually involuntary and hidden representational preference towards certain languages. Linguistic bias is manifested in uneven per-language performance even in the case of similar test conditions. We show that biased technology is often the result of research and development methodologies that do not do justice to the complexity of the languages being represented, and that can even become ethically problematic as they disregard valuable aspects of diversity as well as the needs of the language communities themselves. As our attempt at building diversity-aware language resources, we present a new initiative that aims at reducing linguistic bias through both technological design and methodology, based on an eye-level collaboration with local communities.",

    "summary": "This paper highlights the linguistic bias in AI language technology, showing that current systems disproportionately favor dominant languages due to flawed research methodologies. It proposes a new initiative to mitigate this bias through collaborative, community-centered technological design and methodology."

    "published_date": "2024-03-11",
    "abstract": "In this paper we delve into the historical evolution of data as a fundamental element in communication and knowledge transmission. The paper traces the stages of knowledge dissemination from oral traditions to the digital era, highlighting the significance of languages and cultural diversity in this progression. It also explores the impact of digital technologies on memory, communication, and cultural preservation, emphasizing the need for promoting a culture of the digital (rather than a digital culture) in Africa and beyond. Additionally, it discusses the challenges and opportunities presented by data biases in AI development, underscoring the importance of creating diverse datasets for equitable representation. We advocate for investing in data as a crucial raw material for fostering digital literacy, economic development, and, above all, cultural preservation in the digital age.",

    "title": "Evaluating Usability and Engagement of Large Language Models in Virtual Reality for Traditional Scottish Curling",
    "published_date": "2024-08-17",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the innovative application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to promote heritage education, focusing on traditional Scottish curling presented in the game ``Scottish Bonspiel VR''. Our study compares the effectiveness of LLM-based chatbots with pre-defined scripted chatbots, evaluating key criteria such as usability, user engagement, and learning outcomes. The results show that LLM-based chatbots significantly improve interactivity and engagement, creating a more dynamic and immersive learning environment. This integration helps document and preserve cultural heritage and enhances dissemination processes, which are crucial for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage (ICH) amid environmental changes. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of novel technologies in education to provide immersive experiences that foster a deeper appreciation of cultural heritage. These findings support the wider application of LLMs and VR in cultural education to address global challenges and promote sustainable practices to preserve and enhance cultural heritage.",

    "title": "Layers of technology in pluriversal design. Decolonising language technology with the LiveLanguage initiative",
    "published_date": "2024-05-02",
    "abstract": "Language technology has the potential to facilitate intercultural communication through meaningful translations. However, the current state of language technology is deeply entangled with colonial knowledge due to path dependencies and neo-colonial tendencies in the global governance of artificial intelligence (AI). Language technology is a complex and emerging field that presents challenges for co-design interventions due to enfolding in assemblages of global scale and diverse sites and its knowledge intensity. This paper uses LiveLanguage, a lexical database, a set of services with particular emphasis on modelling language diversity and integrating small and minority languages, as an example to discuss and close the gap from pluriversal design theory to practice. By diversifying the concept of emerging technology, we can better approach language technology in global contexts. The paper presents a model comprising of five layers of technological activity. Each layer consists of specific practices and stakeholders, thus provides distinctive spaces for co-design interventions as mode of inquiry for de-linking, re-thinking and re-building language technology towards pluriversality. In that way, the paper contributes to reflecting the position of co-design in decolonising emergent technologies, and to integrating complex theoretical knowledge towards decoloniality into language technology design.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "This paper argues that language technology is inherently colonial, proposing a five-layer model for decolonizing its design through pluriversal approaches and co-design interventions, exemplified by the LiveLanguage initiative. The model identifies specific practices and stakeholders at each layer to facilitate de-linking, re-thinking, and rebuilding language technology toward pluriversality."

    "published_date": "2024-11-20",
    "abstract": "Minority languages are vital to preserving cultural heritage, yet they face growing risks of extinction due to limited digital resources and the dominance of artificial intelligence models trained on high-resource languages. This white paper proposes a framework to generate linguistic tools for low-resource languages, focusing on data creation to support the development of language models that can aid in preservation efforts. Sardinian, an endangered language, serves as the case study to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. By addressing the data scarcity that hinders intelligent applications for such languages, we contribute to promoting linguistic diversity and support ongoing efforts in language standardization and revitalization through modern technologies.",
    "summary": "LIMBA is an open-source framework using generative models to create linguistic tools for low-resource languages, addressing data scarcity to aid preservation efforts, as demonstrated by its application to the endangered Sardinian language. It aims to promote linguistic diversity and revitalization through technological advancements."

    "title": "Shaping the Future of Endangered and Low-Resource Languages - Our Role in the Age of LLMs: A Keynote at ECIR 2024",
    "published_date": "2024-06-01",
    "abstract": "\n Isidore of Seville is credited with the adage that\n it is language that gives birth to a people, and not the other way around\n , underlining the profound role played by language in the formation of cultural and social identity. Today, of the more than 7100 languages listed, a significant number are endangered. Since the 1970s, linguists, information seekers and enthusiasts have helped develop digital resources and automatic tools to support a wide range of languages, including endangered ones. The advent of Large Language Model (LLM) technologies holds both promise and peril. They offer unprecedented possibilities for the translation and generation of content and resources, key elements in the preservation and revitalisation of languages. They also present threat of homogenisation, cultural oversimplification and the further marginalisation of already vulnerable languages. The talk this paper is based on has proposed an initiatory journey, exploring the potential paths and partnerships between technology and tradition, with a particular focus on the Occitan language. Occitan is a language from Southern France, parts of Spain and Italy that played a major cultural and economic role, particularly in the Middle Ages. It is now endangered according to UNESCO. The talk critically has examined how human expertise and artificial intelligence can work together to offer hope for preserving the linguistic diversity that forms the foundation of our global and especially our European heritage while addressing some of the ethical and practical challenges that accompany the use of these powerful technologies. This paper is based on the keynote I gave at the 46th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2024). As an alternative to reading this paper, a video talk is available online.\n 1\n \n Date: 26 March 2024.",
    "summary": "This paper, based on an ECIR 2024 keynote, explores the potential of LLMs to preserve endangered languages like Occitan, while critically examining the risks of homogenization and emphasizing the need for collaboration between human expertise and AI to safeguard linguistic diversity. A video of the keynote is available online."
