### Mini Description

Analysis of how AI systems affect cultural diversity, traditional practices, and the transmission of cultural knowledge across generations

### Description

Cultural preservation in the context of AI safety examines how artificial intelligence systems impact the maintenance, transmission, and evolution of cultural heritage, traditions, and diverse ways of life. This research area investigates both the threats and opportunities that AI technologies present to cultural preservation, including how automated systems might inadvertently erode local customs, languages, and traditional knowledge systems, as well as how they might be leveraged to document and protect cultural practices.

A key focus is understanding how AI-driven homogenization of global communication, entertainment, and information sharing affects cultural diversity. Researchers study how recommendation algorithms and content distribution systems can either amplify dominant cultural narratives at the expense of minority perspectives or be designed to actively promote cultural plurality. This includes examining how language models and translation systems impact linguistic diversity, and how automated content moderation affects cultural expression.

The field also explores methodologies for embedding cultural awareness and sensitivity into AI systems, ensuring they can operate effectively across different cultural contexts while respecting and preserving local traditions. This involves developing frameworks for documenting cultural knowledge in machine-readable formats, creating AI systems that can adapt to different cultural norms, and designing mechanisms for communities to maintain agency over their cultural heritage in an increasingly AI-mediated world.
