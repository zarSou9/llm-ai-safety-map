### Mini Description

Investigation of methods to protect and integrate indigenous and traditional knowledge systems within AI development and deployment

### Description

Traditional knowledge systems encompass indigenous, local, and historical ways of understanding and interacting with the world, developed through generations of observation, practice, and cultural transmission. As AI systems become increasingly influential in knowledge management and decision-making, preserving and integrating these traditional knowledge systems becomes crucial for maintaining cultural diversity and accessing valuable insights that may not be captured by conventional scientific approaches.

A key challenge in this domain is developing methodologies to effectively translate traditional knowledge into forms that can be understood and utilized by AI systems while preserving its essential context and meaning. This includes addressing questions of knowledge ownership, appropriate attribution, and preventing misappropriation or oversimplification of complex cultural understandings. Researchers must navigate the tension between making traditional knowledge accessible to AI systems and respecting cultural protocols around knowledge sharing and sacred information.

Current research focuses on creating frameworks for ethical knowledge integration, developing AI architectures that can accommodate different epistemological systems, and establishing protocols for meaningful collaboration between AI developers and traditional knowledge holders. This includes exploring ways to encode traditional ecological knowledge, indigenous governance systems, and cultural practices in ways that maintain their integrity while allowing them to inform and enhance AI development.
