    "title": "Cultural Heritage and Internet of Things",
    "abstract": "Ancient structures and historical buildings represent invaluable assets for future generations. They need to be preserved as much as possible since, as cultural heritage, provide with irreplaceable cultural, social and historical wealth, not only for the local heir communities, but in many cases for the whole human kind. In the context of today's technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm represents one of the most effective ways for monitoring \"things\" around us. Cultural Heritage stays as one important application field for IoT, since conservation of cultural heritage sites can be significantly improved by means of an efficient and well-designed monitoring and control system. However, there are many approaches to apply IoT on Cultural Heritage use cases. For this reason, in this paper we discuss IoT architectures currently used for monitoring and preservation of historical buildings, and identify existing challenges IoT applications are still facing to become a fundamental part in the conservation of the everlasting cultural values these buildings represent.",
