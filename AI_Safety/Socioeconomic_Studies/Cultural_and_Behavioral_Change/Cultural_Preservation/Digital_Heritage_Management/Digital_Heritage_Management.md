### Mini Description

Development and implementation of AI systems for documenting, preserving, and providing access to cultural heritage, including artifacts, traditions, and historical knowledge

### Description

Digital Heritage Management in AI safety focuses on developing and deploying AI systems that can effectively preserve, document, and provide access to cultural heritage while minimizing risks of loss or misrepresentation. This includes creating robust digital archives, implementing AI-powered documentation tools, and developing preservation strategies that maintain the authenticity and context of cultural artifacts, practices, and knowledge. The field addresses technical challenges such as data format obsolescence, storage degradation, and the need for sustainable long-term preservation solutions.

A key challenge lies in developing AI systems that can capture and represent the multifaceted nature of cultural heritage, including intangible elements like oral traditions, performing arts, and social practices. This involves creating sophisticated documentation methodologies that can record not just the physical attributes of artifacts but also their cultural significance, historical context, and associated traditions. Researchers work on developing AI models that can understand and preserve the relationships between different cultural elements while ensuring accurate metadata creation and maintaining provenance information.

The field also grapples with questions of access control, ethical digitization practices, and the development of user interfaces that can meaningfully present cultural heritage to different audiences. This includes addressing issues of intellectual property rights, cultural sensitivity in presentation, and the development of adaptive access systems that can serve both scholarly research and public education while respecting cultural protocols. Researchers focus on creating frameworks for sustainable digital preservation that can evolve with technological changes while maintaining the integrity and accessibility of cultural heritage materials.
