### Mini Description

Research on how AI-mediated interactions affect the development and maintenance of social skills, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal capabilities

### Description

Social skill development research examines how increasing interaction with AI systems affects the acquisition, maintenance, and evolution of human social capabilities. This includes studying how AI-mediated communication influences the development of fundamental social skills like empathy, active listening, non-verbal communication interpretation, and conflict resolution. Researchers investigate both potential enhancement effects, where AI systems might augment social learning, and potential interference effects, where AI interaction patterns might impede natural social skill acquisition.

A central focus is understanding how different demographics, particularly young people who are still developing core social competencies, adapt their social learning processes in AI-rich environments. This involves examining how exposure to AI-mediated interactions during critical developmental periods affects emotional intelligence, social cognition, and interpersonal relationship capabilities. Researchers analyze both direct effects from interaction with AI systems and indirect effects from observing and participating in AI-influenced social environments.

Key challenges include developing methodologies to measure long-term impacts on social skill development, identifying critical periods where AI exposure might have outsized effects, and designing interventions to ensure healthy social development in increasingly AI-mediated contexts. This includes studying how to leverage AI systems to enhance social skill development while mitigating potential negative impacts, and understanding how traditional social skill development frameworks need to be updated for an AI-integrated world.
