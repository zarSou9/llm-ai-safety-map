    "title": "Mutual benefits of social learning and algorithmic mediation for cumulative culture",
    "published_date": "2024-10-01",
    "abstract": "The remarkable ecological success of humans is often attributed to our ability to develop complex cultural artefacts that enable us to cope with environmental challenges. The evolution of complex culture (cumulative cultural evolution) is usually modeled as a collective process in which individuals invent new artefacts (innovation) and copy information from others (social learning). This classic picture overlooks the fact that in the digital age, intelligent algorithms are increasingly mediating information between humans, with potential consequences for cumulative cultural evolution. Building on an established model of cultural evolution, we investigate the combined effects of network-based social learning and a simplistic version of algorithmic mediation on cultural accumulation. We find that algorithmic mediation has a strong impact on cultural accumulation and that this impact generally increases as social networks become less densely connected. Moreover, cultural accumulation tends to be optimal when social learning and algorithmic mediation are combined, and the optimal ratio depends on the network's density. Our modeling results are a first step towards formalising the impact of intelligent algorithms on cumulative cultural evolution within an established framework. Models of this kind will also help to uncover mechanisms of human-machine interaction in cultural contexts, guiding hypotheses for future experimental testing.",
    "summary": "This paper models the combined effects of social learning and algorithmic mediation on cumulative cultural evolution, finding that both mechanisms synergistically enhance cultural accumulation, particularly when social networks are sparsely connected. Optimal cultural accumulation arises from a balanced combination of both, with the ideal ratio dependent on network density."

    "title": "Generative AI Triggers Welfare-Reducing Decisions in Humans",
    "published_date": "2024-01-23",
    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape the way individuals communicate and interact. While this form of AI has the potential to efficiently make numerous human decisions, there is limited understanding of how individuals respond to its use in social interaction. In particular, it remains unclear how individuals engage with algorithms when the interaction entails consequences for other people. Here, we report the results of a large-scale pre-registered online experiment (N = 3,552) indicating diminished fairness, trust, trustworthiness, cooperation, and coordination by human players in economic twoplayer games, when the decision of the interaction partner is taken over by ChatGPT. On the contrary, we observe no adverse welfare effects when individuals are uncertain about whether they are interacting with a human or generative AI. Therefore, the promotion of AI transparency, often suggested as a solution to mitigate the negative impacts of generative AI on society, shows a detrimental effect on welfare in our study. Concurrently, participants frequently delegate decisions to ChatGPT, particularly when the AI's involvement is undisclosed, and individuals struggle to discern between AI and human decisions.",

    "summary": "A large-scale experiment revealed that human participants in economic games exhibited reduced fairness and cooperation when interacting with ChatGPT, unlike when uncertainty existed about the AI's involvement; this suggests that AI transparency may negatively impact welfare rather than improve it. Participants also frequently delegated decisions to ChatGPT, especially when its presence was hidden."

    "title": "Social AI Improves Well-Being Among Female Young Adults",
    "published_date": "2023-11-12",
    "abstract": "The rise of language models like ChatGPT has introduced Social AI as a new form of entertainment, particularly among young adults who engage with AI-powered agents. This paper investigates the effects of these interactions on users' social and mental well-being, a subject that has incited extensive debate among both the public and scholars. Our study involved a survey of 5,260 users of Chai, a Social AI Platform. The findings indicate significant benefits, with notable variations across demographics. Female users, in particular, reported the most substantial improvements: 43.4% strongly agreed that Social AI positively impacted their mental health, exceeding male users by 10.5%. In managing social anxieties, 38.9% of females strongly agreed on a positive impact, compared to 30.0% for males and 27.1% for other genders. Historically, new media and technology have often been met with groundless moral panic, with societal figures raising concerns without substantial evidence of harm. Our research indicates the importance of approaching such claims with caution and emphasizes the necessity of an evidence-based perspective in discussions about the behavioral effects of emerging technologies.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "A survey of 5,260 Chai users revealed that Social AI interactions significantly improved the mental and social well-being of female young adults, more so than male users, suggesting potential benefits counter to some prevalent concerns. This challenges the narrative of inherent harm associated with emerging technologies and underscores the need for evidence-based assessments."

    "title": "The SocialAI School: Insights from Developmental Psychology Towards Artificial Socio-Cultural Agents",
    "published_date": "2023-07-15",
    "abstract": "Developmental psychologists have long-established the importance of socio-cognitive abilities in human intelligence. These abilities enable us to enter, participate and benefit from human culture. AI research on social interactive agents mostly concerns the emergence of culture in a multi-agent setting (often without a strong grounding in developmental psychology). We argue that AI research should be informed by psychology and study socio-cognitive abilities enabling to enter a culture too. We discuss the theories of Michael Tomasello and Jerome Bruner to introduce some of their concepts to AI and outline key concepts and socio-cognitive abilities. We present The SocialAI school - a tool including a customizable parameterized uite of procedurally generated environments, which simplifies conducting experiments regarding those concepts. We show examples of such experiments with RL agents and Large Language Models. The main motivation of this work is to engage the AI community around the problem of social intelligence informed by developmental psychology, and to provide a tool to simplify first steps in this direction. Refer to the project website for code and additional information: https://sites.google.com/view/socialai-school.",

    "summary": "This paper advocates for integrating developmental psychology insights into AI research on social agents, arguing that understanding socio-cognitive abilities crucial for cultural participation is key to creating more intelligent artificial agents. It introduces \"The SocialAI school,\" a tool facilitating experiments on these abilities using reinforcement learning and large language models."

    "summary": "The article examines applying game theory to AI development within organizational structures, highlighting both its strengths in multi-agent systems and limitations regarding complex decision-making. It argues that even with advanced AI, bureaucratic structures, characterized by hierarchical authority and specialized tasks, will remain necessary for efficient goal achievement due to limitations in any single entity's processing capacity."

    "published_date": "2021-04-02",
    "abstract": "Recent work has explored how complementary strengths of humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems might be productively combined. However, successful forms of human-AI partnership have rarely been demonstrated in real-world settings. We present the iterative design and evaluation of Lumilo, smart glasses that help teachers help their students in AI-supported classrooms by presenting real-time analytics about students' learning, metacognition, and behavior. Results from a field study conducted in K-12 classrooms indicate that students learn more when teachers and AI tutors work together during class. We discuss implications of this research for the design of human-AI partnerships. We argue for more participatory approaches to research and design in this area, in which practitioners and other stakeholders are deeply, meaningfully involved throughout the process. Furthermore, we advocate for theory-building and for principled approaches to the study of human-AI decision-making in real-world contexts.",
