Development and application of frameworks to measure and evaluate the quality, depth, and authenticity of AI-mediated social interactions

### Description

Interaction Quality Metrics focuses on developing and validating measurement frameworks to assess the effectiveness, depth, and authenticity of AI-mediated social interactions. This research area combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluate how AI systems affect various dimensions of human communication, from surface-level engagement metrics to deeper measures of emotional connection and mutual understanding. Researchers work to establish standardized methods for comparing different interaction modalities while accounting for contextual factors like cultural differences and interaction purposes.

A central challenge is defining and operationalizing abstract concepts like 'authenticity' and 'meaningful connection' in ways that can be reliably measured. This involves developing multi-dimensional assessment frameworks that combine objective behavioral indicators (such as response patterns and engagement duration) with subjective measures of participant experience and satisfaction. Researchers also grapple with capturing both immediate interaction quality and longer-term relationship development outcomes.

Current research priorities include developing real-time quality assessment tools that can adapt to different interaction contexts, establishing baseline comparisons between AI-mediated and traditional interaction formats, and creating frameworks for evaluating how AI intermediaries affect the fidelity of human-to-human communication. This includes investigating how different demographic groups experience and evaluate interaction quality, and how various AI design choices influence key quality metrics.
