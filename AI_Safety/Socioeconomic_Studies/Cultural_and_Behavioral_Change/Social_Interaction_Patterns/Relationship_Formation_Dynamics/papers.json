    "title": "Should ChatGPT Write Your Breakup Text? Exploring the Role of AI in Relationship Dissolution",
    "published_date": "2024-01-18",
    "abstract": "Relationships are essential to our happiness and wellbeing, yet their dissolution-the final stage of a relationship's lifecycle-is among the most stressful events individuals can experience, often leading to profound and lasting impacts. With the breakup process increasingly facilitated by technology, such as computer-mediated communication, and the likely future influence of generative AI (GenAI) tools, we conducted a semi-structured interview study with 21 participants. We aim to understand: 1) the current role of technology in the breakup process, 2) the needs and support individuals seek during this time, and 3) how GenAI might address or undermine these needs. Our findings show that people have distinct needs at various stages of breakups. While currently technology plays an important role, it falls short in supporting users' unmet needs. Participants envision that GenAI could: 1) aid in prompting self-reflection, providing neutral second opinions, and assisting with planning leading up to a breakup; 2) serve as a communication mediator, supporting wording and tone to facilitate emotional expression during breakup conversations; and 3) support personal growth and offer companionship after a breakup. However, our findings also reveal participants' concerns about involving GenAI in this process. Based on our results, we discuss the potential opportunities, design considerations, and harms of GenAI tools in facilitating people's relationship dissolution.",
    "summary": "This study explores how technology, particularly generative AI, is used in breakups, finding that while technology currently offers limited support, AI could potentially aid self-reflection, communication, and post-breakup healing, but also raises ethical concerns."

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence alignment focuses on ensuring powerful AI systems act according to human values, addressing the risk of unintended consequences and existential threats. This involves diverse approaches ranging from narrow goals (e.g., curing a disease) to broader ambitions (e.g., creating a beneficial future), all aiming to prevent AI from pursuing harmful objectives."

    "title": "A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Continuous Tie Strengths",
    "published_date": "2021-01-23",
    "abstract": "Relationships between people constantly evolve, altering interpersonal behavior and defining social groups. Relationships between nodes in social networks can be represented by a tie strength, often empirically assessed using surveys. While this is effective for taking static snapshots of relationships, such methods are difficult to scale to dynamic networks. In this paper, we propose a system that allows for the continuous approximation of relationships as they evolve over time. We evaluate this system using the NetSense study, which provides comprehensive communication records of students at the University of Notre Dame over the course of four years. These records are complemented by semesterly ego network surveys, which provide discrete samples over time of each participant's true social tie strength with others. We develop a pair of powerful machine learning models (complemented by a suite of baselines extracted from past works) that learn from these surveys to interpret the communications records as signals. These signals represent dynamic tie strengths, accurately recording the evolution of relationships between the individuals in our social networks. With these evolving tie values, we are able to make several empirically derived observations which we compare to past works.",

The model accurately tracks relationship dynamics, offering insights into social network evolution."

    "title": "Machine learning uncovers the most robust self-report predictors of relationship quality across 43 longitudinal couples studies",
    "abstract": "Significance What predicts how happy people are with their romantic relationships? Relationship science—an interdisciplinary field spanning psychology, sociology, economics, family studies, and communication—has identified hundreds of variables that purportedly shape romantic relationship quality. The current project used machine learning to directly quantify and compare the predictive power of many such variables among 11,196 romantic couples. People's own judgments about the relationship itself—such as how satisfied and committed they perceived their partners to be, and how appreciative they felt toward their partners—explained approximately 45% of their current satisfaction. The partner's judgments did not add information, nor did either person's personalities or traits. Furthermore, none of these variables could predict whose relationship quality would increase versus decrease over time. Given the powerful implications of relationship quality for health and well-being, a central mission of relationship science is explaining why some romantic relationships thrive more than others. This large-scale project used machine learning (i.e., Random Forests) to 1) quantify the extent to which relationship quality is predictable and 2) identify which constructs reliably predict relationship quality. Across 43 dyadic longitudinal datasets from 29 laboratories, the top relationship-specific predictors of relationship quality were perceived-partner commitment, appreciation, sexual satisfaction, perceived-partner satisfaction, and conflict. The top individual-difference predictors were life satisfaction, negative affect, depression, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety. Overall, relationship-specific variables predicted up to 45% of variance at baseline, and up to 18% of variance at the end of each study. Individual differences also performed well (21% and 12%, respectively). Actor-reported variables (i.e., own relationship-specific and individual-difference variables) predicted two to four times more variance than partner-reported variables (i.e., the partner's ratings on those variables). Importantly, individual differences and partner reports had no predictive effects beyond actor-reported relationship-specific variables alone. These findings imply that the sum of all individual differences and partner experiences exert their influence on relationship quality via a person's own relationship-specific experiences, and effects due to moderation by individual differences and moderation by partner-reports may be quite small. Finally, relationship-quality change (i.e., increases or decreases in relationship quality over the course of a study) was largely unpredictable from any combination of self-report variables. This collective effort should guide future models of relationships.",

    "summary": "Using machine learning on data from 43 longitudinal couples studies, researchers found that individuals' own perceptions of their relationship (e.g., partner commitment, appreciation) were the strongest predictors of relationship quality, explaining up to 45% of the variance, while partner reports and individual differences added little predictive power. Changes in relationship quality over time, however, proved largely unpredictable."

    "title": "Machine learning meets partner matching: Predicting the future relationship quality based on personality traits",
    "abstract": "To what extent is it possible to use machine learning to predict the outcome of a relationship, based on the personality of both partners? In the present study, relationship satisfaction, conflicts, and separation (intents) of 192 partners four years after the completion of questionnaires concerning their personality traits was predicted. A 10x10-fold cross-validation was used to ensure that the results of the linear regression models are reproducible. The findings indicate that machine learning techniques can improve the prediction of relationship quality (37% of variance explained), and that the perceived relationship quality of a partner is mostly dependent on his or her own individual personality traits. Additionally, the influences of different sets of variables on predictions are shown: partner and similarity effects did not incrementally predict relationship quality beyond actor effects and general personality traits predicted relationship quality less strongly than relationship-related personality.",
