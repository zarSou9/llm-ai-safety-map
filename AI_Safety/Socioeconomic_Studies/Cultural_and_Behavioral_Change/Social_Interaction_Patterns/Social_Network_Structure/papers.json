    "title": "Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities",
    "published_date": "2024-11-16",
    "abstract": "Social influence plays an important role in shaping individual opinions and actions, particularly in our digitally connected world. AI-generated, personalized content has led to serious and well-founded concerns, including United States Supreme Court Cases regarding the potential for the radicalization of individuals based on social influence. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on the integrity of a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and use tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamic Structure Function (DSF)), to identify precisely the perturbations that are sufficient to qualitatively alter the system's equilibrium and also minimal in norm. In particular, we examine two scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations taking the form of the addition of a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that even small alterations to network structure may cause sentiments to grow in magnitude without bound, indicating the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by minor adjustments in social influence. Our findings emphasize the imperative need for further investigation into vulnerabilities in real-world social networks, where such dynamics may already exist.",
    "summary": "This paper uses robust control theory to demonstrate that small, targeted perturbations to a simple social network model, such as adding or altering a connection, can drastically destabilize the system's equilibrium, leading to unbounded growth in collective sentiment. The findings highlight the vulnerability of social networks to manipulation via seemingly minor structural changes."

    "title": "Generative AI Triggers Welfare-Reducing Decisions in Humans",
    "published_date": "2024-01-23",
    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape the way individuals communicate and interact. While this form of AI has the potential to efficiently make numerous human decisions, there is limited understanding of how individuals respond to its use in social interaction. In particular, it remains unclear how individuals engage with algorithms when the interaction entails consequences for other people. Here, we report the results of a large-scale pre-registered online experiment (N = 3,552) indicating diminished fairness, trust, trustworthiness, cooperation, and coordination by human players in economic twoplayer games, when the decision of the interaction partner is taken over by ChatGPT. On the contrary, we observe no adverse welfare effects when individuals are uncertain about whether they are interacting with a human or generative AI. Therefore, the promotion of AI transparency, often suggested as a solution to mitigate the negative impacts of generative AI on society, shows a detrimental effect on welfare in our study. Concurrently, participants frequently delegate decisions to ChatGPT, particularly when the AI's involvement is undisclosed, and individuals struggle to discern between AI and human decisions.",

    "summary": "A large-scale experiment (N=3,552) reveals that human participants exhibit reduced fairness, trust, and cooperation in economic games when interacting with a ChatGPT-controlled partner, but not when AI involvement is uncertain; contrary to expectations, transparency about AI participation negatively impacts welfare."

    "title": "Social bots sour activist sentiment without eroding engagement",
    "published_date": "2024-03-19",
    "abstract": "Social media platforms have witnessed a substantial increase in social bot activity, significantly affecting online discourse. Our study explores the dynamic nature of bot engagement related to Extinction Rebellion climate change protests from 18 November 2019 to 10 December 2019. We find that bots exert a greater influence on human behavior than vice versa during heated online periods. To assess the causal impact of human-bot communication, we compared communication histories between human users who directly interacted with bots and matched human users who did not. Our findings demonstrate a consistent negative impact of bot interactions on subsequent human sentiment, with exposed users displaying significantly more negative sentiment than their counterparts. Furthermore, the nature of bot interaction influences human tweeting activity and the sentiment towards protests. Political astroturfing bots increase activity, whereas other bots decrease it. Sentiment changes towards protests depend on the user's original support level, indicating targeted manipulation. However, bot interactions do not change activists' engagement towards protests. Despite the seemingly minor impact of individual bot encounters, the cumulative effect is profound due to the large volume of bot communication. Our findings underscore the importance of unrestricted access to social media data for studying the prevalence and influence of social bots, as with new technological advancements distinguishing between bots and humans becomes nearly impossible.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "A study of social bots' impact on Extinction Rebellion online discourse revealed that while bot interactions negatively affected human sentiment towards the protests, they did not reduce overall activist engagement; this negative sentiment shift was dependent on pre-existing support levels and bot type, highlighting the potential for targeted manipulation despite unchanged engagement."

    "title": "AI Can Enhance Creativity in Social Networks",
    "published_date": "2024-10-20",
    "abstract": "Can peer recommendation engines elevate people's creative performances in self-organizing social networks? Answering this question requires resolving challenges in data collection (e.g., tracing inspiration links and psycho-social attributes of nodes) and intervention design (e.g., balancing idea stimulation and redundancy in evolving information environments). We trained a model that predicts people's ideation performances using semantic and network-structural features in an online platform. Using this model, we built SocialMuse, which maximizes people's predicted performances to generate peer recommendations for them. We found treatment networks leveraging SocialMuse outperforming AI-agnostic control networks in several creativity measures. The treatment networks were more decentralized than the control, as SocialMuse increasingly emphasized network-structural features at large network sizes. This decentralization spreads people's inspiration sources, helping inspired ideas stand out better. Our study provides actionable insights into building intelligent systems for elevating creativity.",
    "summary": "A study using a machine learning model called SocialMuse demonstrated that AI-powered peer recommendations in online social networks can significantly enhance users' creative output, leading to more decentralized and innovative idea generation. This improvement is attributed to SocialMuse's ability to optimize recommendations based on both semantic and network features."

    "title": "Social AI Improves Well-Being Among Female Young Adults",
    "published_date": "2023-11-12",
    "abstract": "The rise of language models like ChatGPT has introduced Social AI as a new form of entertainment, particularly among young adults who engage with AI-powered agents. This paper investigates the effects of these interactions on users' social and mental well-being, a subject that has incited extensive debate among both the public and scholars. Our study involved a survey of 5,260 users of Chai, a Social AI Platform. The findings indicate significant benefits, with notable variations across demographics. Female users, in particular, reported the most substantial improvements: 43.4% strongly agreed that Social AI positively impacted their mental health, exceeding male users by 10.5%. In managing social anxieties, 38.9% of females strongly agreed on a positive impact, compared to 30.0% for males and 27.1% for other genders. Historically, new media and technology have often been met with groundless moral panic, with societal figures raising concerns without substantial evidence of harm. Our research indicates the importance of approaching such claims with caution and emphasizes the necessity of an evidence-based perspective in discussions about the behavioral effects of emerging technologies.",
    "citation_count": 1,
    "summary": "A survey of 5,260 Chai users revealed that Social AI significantly improved the mental well-being and social anxiety management of female young adults, more so than for male users, countering concerns about potential negative impacts of emerging technologies. This suggests a need for evidence-based assessments of new technologies rather than relying on unsubstantiated moral panic."

    "title": "Coupling Asymmetry Optimizes Collective Dynamics Over Multiplex Networks",
    "published_date": "2021-06-24",
    "abstract": "Networks are often interconnected, with one system wielding greater influence over another. However, the effects of such asymmetry on self-organized phenomena (e.g., consensus and synchronization) are not well understood. Here, we study collective dynamics using a generalized graph Laplacian for multiplex networks containing layers that are asymmetrically coupled. We explore the nonlinear effects of coupling asymmetry on the convergence rate toward a collective state, finding that asymmetry induces one or more optima that maximally accelerate convergence. When a faster and a slower system are coupled, depending on their relative timescales, their optimal coupling is either cooperative (network layers mutually depend on one another) or non-cooperative (one network directs another without a reciprocated influence). It is often optimal for the faster system to more-strongly influence the slower one, yet counter-intuitively, the opposite can also be true. As an application, we model collective decision-making for a human-AI system in which a social network is supported by an AI-agent network, finding that a cooperative optimum requires that these two networks operate on a sufficiently similar timescale. More broadly, our work highlights the optimization of coupling asymmetry and timescale balancing as fundamental concepts for the design of collective behavior over interconnected systems.",
    "summary": "This paper demonstrates that asymmetric coupling between layers in multiplex networks can significantly improve the speed of convergence towards collective states like consensus, with optimal coupling strength depending on the relative timescales of the interacting systems. Optimal coupling may be cooperative or non-cooperative, and counter-intuitively, stronger influence from a slower system to a faster one can sometimes be beneficial."

    "title": "Modelling Cooperation in Network Games with Spatio-Temporal Complexity",
    "published_date": "2021-02-13",
    "abstract": "The real world is awash with multi-agent problems that require collective action by self-interested agents, from the routing of packets across a computer network to the management of irrigation systems. Such systems have local incentives for individuals, whose behavior has an impact on the global outcome for the group. Given appropriate mechanisms describing agent interaction, groups may achieve socially beneficial outcomes, even in the face of short-term selfish incentives. In many cases, collective action problems possess an underlying graph structure, whose topology crucially determines the relationship between local decisions and emergent global effects. Such scenarios have received great attention through the lens of network games. However, this abstraction typically collapses important dimensions, such as geometry and time, relevant to the design of mechanisms promoting cooperation. In parallel work, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning has shown great promise in modelling the emergence of self-organized cooperation in complex gridworld domains. Here we apply this paradigm in graph-structured collective action problems. Using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, we simulate an agent society for a variety of plausible mechanisms, finding clear transitions between different equilibria over time. We define analytic tools inspired by related literatures to measure the social outcomes, and use these to draw conclusions about the efficacy of different environmental interventions. Our methods have implications for mechanism design in both human and artificial agent systems.",
    "citation_count": 5,
    "summary": "This paper uses multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to model cooperation in network games, incorporating spatio-temporal complexity often absent in traditional network game models, and analyzes the impact of different mechanisms on achieving socially beneficial outcomes. The findings offer insights into mechanism design for both human and artificial agent systems."

    "summary": "The standard epidemiological model poorly predicts COVID-19 infection rates across US states, failing to explain the surprisingly similar infection levels despite varying policy stringency. A proposed \"vulnerability model,\" incorporating fluctuating individual susceptibility to infection, better explains the observed data and the lack of large infection spikes."
