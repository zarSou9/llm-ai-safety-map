### Mini Description

Investigation of changes in social network topology, strength of ties, and community formation patterns due to AI-mediated interactions

### Description

Social network structure research examines how AI systems reshape the fundamental patterns of human social connections, investigating changes in network topology, clustering patterns, and the nature of social ties. This includes analyzing how AI-mediated platforms alter the formation and dissolution of connections, the spread of information and influence through networks, and the emergence of new types of social hierarchies and community structures. Researchers study both direct effects, such as AI-driven friend recommendations and content filtering, and indirect effects like changes in social capital accumulation and network resilience.

A key focus is understanding how AI systems influence the balance between strong and weak ties, the formation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, and the evolution of bridging and bonding social capital. This involves developing new metrics and methodologies to measure network properties in AI-mediated environments, including approaches to quantify changes in network density, centrality patterns, and community boundaries. Researchers also investigate how different demographic groups experience and adapt to these structural changes, and how network modifications affect social mobility and access to resources.

Current challenges include developing frameworks to predict long-term network evolution under AI influence, understanding the relationship between network structure and information quality, and identifying intervention points to promote healthy network formation. This includes studying how AI systems might be designed to enhance beneficial network properties while mitigating potential negative effects like increased polarization or social fragmentation. Particular attention is paid to the role of AI in shaping power dynamics within networks and its impact on social resilience and collective action capabilities.
