    "title": "Facing Identity: The Formation and Performance of Identity via Face-Based Artificial Intelligence Technologies",
    "published_date": "2024-10-16",
    "abstract": "How is identity constructed and performed in the digital via face-based artificial intelligence technologies? While questions of identity on the textual Internet have been thoroughly explored, the Internet has progressed to a multimedia form that not only centers the visual, but specifically the face. At the same time, a wealth of scholarship has and continues to center the topics of surveillance and control through facial recognition technologies (FRTs), which have extended the logics of the racist pseudoscience of physiognomy. Much less work has been devoted to understanding how such face-based artificial intelligence technologies have influenced the formation and performance of identity. This literature review considers how such technologies interact with faciality, which entails the construction of what a face may represent or signify, along axes of identity such as race, gender, and sexuality. In grappling with recent advances in AI such as image generation and deepfakes, I propose that we are now in an era of\"post-facial\"technologies that build off our existing culture of facility while eschewing the analog face, complicating our relationship with identity vis-a-vis the face. Drawing from previous frameworks of identity play in the digital, as well as trans practices that have historically played with or transgressed the boundaries of identity classification, we can develop concepts adequate for analyzing digital faciality and identity given the current landscape of post-facial artificial intelligence technologies that allow users to interface with the digital in an entirely novel manner. To ground this framework of transgression, I conclude by proposing an interview study with VTubers -- online streamers who perform using motion-captured avatars instead of their real-life faces -- to gain qualitative insight on how these sociotechnical experiences.",
    "summary": "This literature review examines how face-based AI technologies, including facial recognition and image generation, influence identity formation and performance online, arguing that these \"post-facial\" technologies complicate our relationship with identity by allowing for novel forms of self-representation and challenging traditional notions of faciality. The author proposes studying VTubers to further understand these evolving dynamics."

    "title": "The Psychological Impacts of Algorithmic and AI-Driven Social Media on Teenagers: A Call to Action",
    "published_date": "2024-08-19",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the meta-issues surrounding social media, which, while theoretically designed to enhance social interactions and improve our social lives by facilitating the sharing of personal experiences and life events, often results in adverse psychological impacts. Our investigation reveals a paradoxical outcome: rather than fostering closer relationships and improving social lives, the algorithms and structures that underlie social media platforms inadvertently contribute to a profound psychological impact on individuals, influencing them in unforeseen ways. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced among teenagers, who are disproportionately affected by curated online personas, peer pressure to present a perfect digital image, and the constant bombardment of notifications and updates that characterize their social media experience. As such, we issue a call to action for policymakers, platform developers, and educators to prioritize the well-being of teenagers in the digital age and work towards creating secure and safe social media platforms that protect the young from harm, online harassment, and exploitation.",

    "title": "\"Sharing, Not Showing Off\": How BeReal Approaches Authentic Self-Presentation on Social Media Through Its Design",
    "published_date": "2024-08-06",
    "abstract": "\n Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the pressures created by social media, such as heightened self-consciousness and the need for extensive self-presentation. In this study, we investigate how\n BeReal,\n a social media platform designed to counter some of these pressures, influences adolescents' self-presentation behaviors. We interviewed 29 users aged 13-18 to understand their experiences with BeReal. We found that BeReal's design focuses on spontaneous sharing, including randomly timed daily notifications and reciprocal posting, discourages staged posts, encourages careful curation of the audience, and reduces pressure on self-presentation. The space created by BeReal offers benefits such as validating an unfiltered life and reframing social comparison, but its approach to self-presentation is sometimes perceived as limited or unappealing and, at times, even toxic. Drawing on this empirical data, we propose design guidelines for platforms that support authentic self-presentation while fostering reciprocity and expanding beyond spontaneous photo-sharing. These guidelines aim to enable users to portray themselves more comprehensively and accurately, ultimately supporting teens' developmental needs, particularly in building authentic relationships.\n",
    "summary": "A study of BeReal users (ages 13-18) reveals that its design, emphasizing spontaneous, reciprocal photo-sharing and limited audience curation, reduces pressure for curated self-presentation, though some users find its limitations unappealing or even toxic. The findings suggest design guidelines for platforms fostering authentic self-presentation and reciprocal relationships beyond spontaneous photo-sharing."

    "title": "Queering AI: Undoing the Self in the Algorithmic Borderlands",
    "published_date": "2024-09-27",
    "abstract": "This paper challenges fixed orientations towards the self in human-AI entanglements. It offers queering as a strategy to subvert the individuation and fixing of identities within algorithmic systems and the loss of futurity that it brings about. By exploring queerness, the paper examines how one's sense of self and futurity are interpellated within the algorithmic borderlands of human-AI entanglements. The study discusses an embodied experiment called\"Undoing Gracia,\"a Digital Twin simulation where the first author Grace and their AI twins (Lex and Tortugi) interact within the fictional world of Gracia. The experiment probes into Grace's multifaceted subjectivities by conceiving themselves as interdependent entities evolving through their interactions within Gracia. The paper outlines the process of creating and implementing the simulation and examines how the agents co-perform and become-with alongside Gracia's making. The findings illuminate queer gestures for navigating human-AI entanglements in HCI research and practice, highlighting the importance of fluid identities in shaping human-AI relations.",
    "summary": "This paper uses a queer theoretical lens to critique the rigid self-identity imposed by human-AI interactions, proposing \"queering\" as a method to disrupt this process and explore fluid identities. Through an embodied experiment involving a digital twin, the authors demonstrate how embracing interdependence can reshape human-AI relationships and foster a more open future."

    "title": "The Echoes of the 'I': Tracing Identity with Demographically Enhanced Word Embeddings",
    "published_date": "2024-06-29",
    "abstract": "Identity is one of the most commonly studied constructs in social science. However, despite extensive theoretical work on identity, there remains a need for additional empirical data to validate and refine existing theories. This paper introduces a novel approach to studying identity by enhancing word embeddings with socio-demographic information. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that our approach successfully reproduces and extends established findings regarding gendered self-views. Our methodology can be applied in a wide variety of settings, allowing researchers to tap into a vast pool of naturally occurring data, such as social media posts. Unlike similar methods already introduced in computer science, our approach allows for the study of differences between social groups. This could be particularly appealing to social scientists and may encourage the faster adoption of computational methods in the field.",
    "summary": "This paper presents a novel method for studying identity using socio-demographically enhanced word embeddings, demonstrating its effectiveness by replicating and extending existing research on gendered self-perception. This approach allows researchers to analyze large datasets of naturally occurring language to investigate group differences in identity."

    "title": "Metaverse Identity: Core Principles and Critical Challenges",
    "published_date": "2024-06-12",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the core principles that should guide the construction and governance of identity in the metaverse and identifies the critical challenges that need to be addressed. Drawing on multidisciplinary theories and perspectives, we define metaverse identity and propose two core principles for understanding its intrinsic characteristics and impacts: Equivalence and Alignment, and Fusion and Expansiveness. The first principle asserts that metaverse identities should align with real-world norms and standards, which is crucial for establishing guidelines and safeguarding rights. The second principle emphasizes the need for seamless integration and boundless expansion of metaverse identities, transcending real-world limitations to accommodate diverse needs and foster inclusive participation. We argue that these two principles are vital for ensuring the accountability, inclusiveness, and consistency in the emerging metaverse era. Additionally, we identify five critical challenges: Identity Interoperability, Legal Implications, Privacy and Identity Management, Deepfakes and Synthetic Identities, and Identity Fragmentation and Psychological Well-being. We discuss potential strategies to navigate these challenges. The paper concludes by underscoring the importance of a proactive and collaborative approach to shaping the future of metaverse identity. As the metaverse continues to evolve, it is imperative that we understand and address the principles and challenges surrounding identity in this uncharted territory and work collectively to build a metaverse that fosters responsible identity construction and expression.",
