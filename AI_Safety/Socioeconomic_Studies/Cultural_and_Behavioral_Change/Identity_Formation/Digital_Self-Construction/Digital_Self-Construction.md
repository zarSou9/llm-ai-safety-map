### Mini Description

Analysis of how individuals build and maintain their online identities through AI-mediated platforms and tools, including the role of algorithmic feedback in shaping digital self-presentation

### Description

Digital self-construction examines how individuals actively shape and maintain their online personas through AI-mediated platforms and tools. This encompasses both conscious choices in digital self-presentation and the ways AI systems influence these choices through feedback loops, engagement metrics, and content optimization algorithms. Research in this area focuses on understanding how people navigate the complex interplay between authentic self-expression and algorithmically-optimized presentation strategies.

A key challenge is understanding how AI systems' reward mechanisms and feedback loops shape digital identity construction. This includes studying how engagement metrics, content recommendations, and social validation mechanisms influence choices in self-presentation, and how individuals adapt their behavior to optimize for algorithmic visibility and social recognition. Researchers investigate both the explicit strategies people employ and the implicit behavioral adaptations that emerge through prolonged interaction with AI-mediated platforms.

Current research examines the psychological impacts of managing multiple digital identities across platforms, the role of AI-generated content in self-expression, and the emergence of new forms of digital self-construction enabled by advancing AI capabilities. This includes studying how individuals balance authenticity with algorithmic optimization, how they maintain coherent identities across different platform contexts, and how they integrate AI tools into their self-presentation strategies. Particular attention is paid to the development of agency and autonomy in digital self-construction within increasingly AI-shaped environments.
