### Mini Description

Research on how AI technologies influence personal and group identity development, expression, and maintenance

### Description

Identity formation in the context of AI safety research examines how artificial intelligence systems influence and shape both individual and collective identity development processes. This encompasses the study of how AI-mediated environments, algorithmic systems, and digital interactions affect how people construct, maintain, and express their sense of self, as well as how group identities emerge and evolve in increasingly AI-integrated social spaces.

A key focus is understanding how AI systems create new contexts and mechanisms for identity construction, including through social media algorithms, personalization systems, and virtual environments. Researchers investigate how AI-driven feedback loops can reinforce or challenge existing identity structures, how algorithmic categorization influences self-perception, and how automated systems may shape identity aspirations and social comparison processes. This includes examining both explicit identity markers (such as digital self-presentation) and implicit identity formation through behavioral patterns and social interactions.

Current research challenges include quantifying the impact of AI systems on identity stability and fluidity, understanding the role of AI in identity-based polarization and tribalism, and developing frameworks to protect authentic identity development in AI-mediated environments. Particular attention is paid to vulnerable populations, including youth and marginalized groups, whose identity formation processes may be disproportionately influenced by AI systems. This work intersects with questions of agency, autonomy, and authenticity in identity development within increasingly AI-shaped social contexts.
