    "published_date": "2024-02-01",
    "summary": "Personal identity, understood as one's self-conception, can hinder rational belief updating and action changes, but it can also be beneficial and enhance rationality depending on how it's maintained. The article notes this tension and distinguishes between imposed and self-constructed identities."

    "summary": "Research reveals that in-context learning in transformer models develops through distinct, interpretable stages identifiable via geometric analysis of the loss landscape. These stages, characterized by changes in model behavior and structure, are observable in both language and linear regression models."

    "title": "Towards Developmental Interpretability",
    "published_date": "2023-07-12",
    "summary": "Developmental interpretability (devinterp) analyzes how neural network structure emerges incrementally through phase transitions during training, contrasting with mechanistic interpretability's focus on the fully trained network. Devinterp leverages Singular Learning Theory to understand this incremental development, aiming to improve AI alignment by providing a new perspective on the final network's structure."

    "published_date": "2023-05-18",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a novel approach to AI corrigibility by designing generative models lacking independent values. Instead, these models would function as extensions of human agency, possessing a collective identity within a unified human-AI system, thereby mitigating the risk of adversarial behavior stemming from conflicting values."

    "title": "How do children's perceptions of machine intelligence change when training and coding smart programs?",
    "abstract": "Children are increasingly surrounded by AI technologies but can overestimate smart devices' abilities due to their lack of transparency. Drawing on the sense-making theory, this study explores how children come to see machine intelligence after training custom machine learning models and creating smart programs that use them. Through a 4-week observational study in after-school programs with 52 children (7 to 12 years old), we found that children engage in the scientific method while training, coding and testing their smart programs. We also found that children became more skeptical of certain abilities of smart devices as they shifted their attribution of agency from the devices to the people who program them. These changes in perception happened both through individual interactions with agents and prompted debates with peers. Based on these results, we conclude with discussions on strategies for promoting children's sense-making practices and sense of agency in the age of machine learning.",

    "summary": "A four-week study of 52 children (ages 7-12) found that creating and training custom machine learning models fostered a more nuanced understanding of AI, shifting their perception of agency from the technology itself to its programmers and increasing skepticism about AI capabilities. This shift occurred through individual experimentation and peer interaction."

    "title": "Beyond Screen Time: Identity Development in the Digital Age",
    "abstract": "Abstract We are in the midst of a global transition in which digital “screens” are no longer simply entertainment devices and distractions; rather, adolescents are currently living in a hybrid reality that links digital spaces to offline contexts. Yet, psychological scientists studying the mental health impact of digital experiences largely focus on correlations with “screen time,” leading to oversimplified and atheoretical conclusions. We propose an alternative, functional approach to studying adolescent mental health in the digital age, one that examines why and how digital media affect adolescent development. Specifically, we suggest that understanding identity development—the core developmental task of adolescence—can help pinpoint the digital experiences that contribute to healthy versus problematic mental health outcomes. We have four objectives: (1) integrate principles from clinical and personality psychology with developmental theory to present a theoretical framework for investigating narrative identity; (2) show how this framework provides a useful lens for evaluating the impact of digital media on adolescents; (3) suggest a set of novel hypotheses that specify what kinds of digital contexts and experiences lead to healthy versus problematic mental health outcomes; and (4) propose a detailed research agenda that tests these hypotheses.",

    "summary": "This paper argues that research on adolescent mental health and digital media should shift from focusing solely on screen time to examining how digital experiences influence identity development, proposing a framework to understand the link between digital contexts and mental health outcomes. It outlines a research agenda to test hypotheses on how specific digital experiences contribute to healthy versus problematic mental health."
