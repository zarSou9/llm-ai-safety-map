### Mini Description

Analysis of how AI exposure during critical developmental periods affects identity formation, particularly in children and adolescents

### Description

Developmental impact research examines how exposure to and interaction with AI systems during critical periods of psychological and social development shapes identity formation. This includes studying how AI-mediated experiences influence cognitive development, social skill acquisition, self-concept formation, and emotional regulation during childhood and adolescence. The field draws on developmental psychology, neuroscience, and digital anthropology to understand both immediate and long-term effects of AI exposure on developing minds.

A central focus is understanding how different types of AI interactions - from educational AI to social media algorithms to virtual assistants - affect various developmental domains. Researchers investigate how AI systems influence language acquisition, emotional intelligence, moral development, and the formation of mental models about technology and society. This includes examining both potential benefits, such as personalized learning opportunities, and risks, such as decreased human social interaction or distorted reality perception.

Key challenges include developing methodologies to study long-term developmental trajectories in rapidly evolving technological environments, identifying critical periods where AI exposure may have outsized effects, and understanding how individual differences in susceptibility interact with AI influence. Current research priorities include investigating how AI-mediated experiences affect executive function development, studying the role of AI in identity exploration and consolidation, and examining how early AI exposure shapes later technological attitudes and behaviors.
