### Mini Description

Investigation of changes in individual and collective decision-making processes due to AI system integration and automation

### Description

Decision-Making Evolution examines how AI systems fundamentally alter human decision-making processes across individual, organizational, and societal levels. This includes studying how people integrate AI recommendations into their judgment, how reliance on AI affects cognitive patterns and heuristics, and how automated decision support systems reshape traditional decision-making frameworks. Research in this area investigates both the immediate behavioral adaptations and long-term cognitive changes that emerge from sustained interaction with AI decision aids.

A key focus is understanding how AI systems influence decision quality, speed, and confidence across different contexts and domains. This includes examining how AI affects risk perception, uncertainty handling, and moral reasoning. Researchers analyze how different presentation formats of AI advice, varying levels of system transparency, and different degrees of human-AI collaboration impact decision outcomes. Of particular interest is how AI systems might enhance or impair human decision-making capabilities through various mechanisms such as skill atrophy, cognitive offloading, or enhanced information processing.

Current research challenges include developing frameworks to measure decision-making competence in AI-augmented environments, understanding the role of trust and algorithmic aversion in human-AI decision systems, and identifying optimal balance points between automated and human judgment. This involves examining how different demographic groups and professional domains adapt their decision-making strategies, and how organizational and social structures evolve to accommodate new decision-making paradigms in the presence of AI systems.
