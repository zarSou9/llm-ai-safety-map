### Mini Description

Investigation of how sustained interaction with AI decision aids affects human decision-making capabilities, including both enhancement and atrophy effects

### Description

Capability Shifts examines how prolonged interaction with AI decision support systems fundamentally alters human cognitive capabilities and decision-making competencies. This encompasses both enhancement effects, where AI augmentation leads to improved human performance and understanding, and deterioration effects, where reliance on AI systems results in skill decay or cognitive offloading. Research in this area focuses on measuring and characterizing these changes across different cognitive domains, time scales, and user populations.

A central challenge involves developing robust methodologies for assessing capability changes, particularly distinguishing between temporary performance improvements due to AI assistance and lasting modifications to underlying human capabilities. This includes studying how different types of AI interactions affect specific cognitive skills, such as analytical reasoning, pattern recognition, and strategic planning. Researchers investigate both direct effects on decision-making abilities and indirect impacts on related cognitive processes like attention, memory, and learning.

Current research priorities include understanding the mechanisms behind capability transfer between AI-assisted and unassisted contexts, identifying factors that promote beneficial capability enhancement while minimizing detrimental effects, and developing interventions to maintain critical human capabilities in increasingly AI-augmented environments. This involves examining how different AI system designs and interaction patterns influence capability development, and how individual differences affect susceptibility to both positive and negative capability shifts.
