### Mini Description

Examination of how decision-making processes and structures within organizations evolve to incorporate AI systems, including changes in hierarchy and authority

### Description

Organizational Adaptation examines how institutions transform their decision-making structures, processes, and hierarchies to effectively incorporate AI systems. This includes studying how traditional organizational frameworks evolve when AI becomes integral to operational and strategic decisions, focusing on changes in authority distribution, responsibility allocation, and coordination mechanisms. The research investigates both planned adaptations implemented by management and emergent changes that arise organically as organizations integrate AI decision support systems.

A key challenge is understanding how organizations balance human expertise with AI capabilities while maintaining operational effectiveness and organizational identity. This involves examining how different organizational roles evolve, how new positions emerge to manage AI systems, and how existing power structures shift when AI systems become key decision-makers. Researchers analyze various adaptation strategies, from centralized approaches that maintain traditional hierarchies to more distributed models that leverage AI to enable flatter, more dynamic organizational structures.

Current research priorities include developing frameworks to measure organizational AI readiness, understanding how different organizational cultures influence adaptation patterns, and identifying effective change management strategies for AI integration. Particular attention is paid to how organizations maintain accountability and control while leveraging AI capabilities, how they manage the transition period during AI adoption, and how they develop new organizational competencies around AI systems. This includes studying both successful and failed adaptation attempts to identify critical success factors and common pitfalls.
