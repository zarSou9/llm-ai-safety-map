### Mini Description

Formation and evolution of reliance relationships with AI systems, including both healthy and problematic forms of dependency

### Description

Dependency patterns in AI safety research examine how individuals and organizations develop varying degrees of reliance on AI systems, focusing on the psychological, operational, and systemic aspects of these dependencies. This includes studying how people and institutions gradually shift decision-making responsibility to AI systems, the factors that influence the depth and nature of these dependencies, and the resulting implications for human agency and system resilience.

Researchers investigate both functional dependencies, where AI systems become essential components of operational processes, and psychological dependencies, where human decision-makers experience reduced confidence or capability in AI-free contexts. Key areas of study include the formation of trust relationships with AI systems, the development of compensatory behaviors when AI systems are unavailable, and the emergence of collective dependencies in organizational settings. This research also examines how different system designs and deployment strategies influence the formation of healthy versus problematic dependency patterns.

Current challenges include developing metrics to quantify dependency levels, understanding the role of individual differences in dependency formation, and identifying early warning signs of problematic dependencies. Researchers are particularly interested in understanding how to design AI systems that support human capabilities while preventing excessive reliance, and how to maintain critical human skills and decision-making abilities in increasingly AI-dependent environments. This includes studying the balance between leveraging AI capabilities and maintaining human autonomy, as well as developing strategies for managing dependencies across different contexts and user populations.
