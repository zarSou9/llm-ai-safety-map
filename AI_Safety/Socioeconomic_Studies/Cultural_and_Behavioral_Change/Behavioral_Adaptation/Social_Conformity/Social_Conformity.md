### Mini Description

Changes in behavior to align with perceived AI system preferences or requirements, including modifications to self-presentation and communication styles

### Description

Social conformity in AI systems examines how individuals and groups modify their behavior to align with perceived AI expectations, requirements, or norms. This phenomenon manifests through changes in self-presentation, communication patterns, and social behaviors when individuals interact with or are monitored by AI systems. The research explores both explicit conformity, where individuals consciously alter their behavior to achieve desired outcomes, and implicit conformity, where behavioral changes occur unconsciously through prolonged exposure to AI-mediated environments.

A key focus is understanding how different AI system designs and deployment contexts influence conformity patterns. This includes studying how recommendation systems shape social behaviors, how automated evaluation systems affect professional conduct, and how AI-driven social platforms influence self-expression and identity presentation. Researchers investigate both beneficial aspects, such as improved compliance with safety protocols, and potential risks, including loss of authenticity and creative expression.

Current challenges include developing methodologies to measure subtle behavioral changes, distinguishing between healthy adaptation and harmful conformity, and understanding how conformity patterns vary across different demographic groups and cultural contexts. Of particular interest is the long-term impact of AI-induced conformity on social diversity, individual agency, and cultural evolution. This includes examining how AI systems might inadvertently create homogenizing pressures on behavior and expression, and how to design systems that encourage beneficial conformity while preserving important aspects of behavioral diversity.
